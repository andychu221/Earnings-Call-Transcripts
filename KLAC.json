I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nWelcome to the December 2025 quarterly earnings call. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results as well as our March quarter and calendar 2026 outlook, which we released after the market close and is available on our website, along with supplemental materials. We are presenting today's discussion and metrics on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. All full year references we make refer to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events, presentations, corporate governance information, and links to our SEC filings. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nAny forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. We will begin the call with Rick providing commentary on the business environment and our quarter, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Before I turn the call over to Rick, I wanted to remind everyone that we are hosting our Investor Day on March the twelfth, and invitations were recently emailed out. Now, over to Rick.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you, Kevin. I will summarize KLA's overall performance for 2025 and the December quarter, as well as cover the current industry landscape. For 2025, KLA continued to deliver relative growth outperformance, along with strong profitability, free cash flow generation, and return to shareholders. For 2025, revenue grew 17% to a record $12.745 billion, with our process control systems business outpacing the industry growth by several points. Earnings per share grew 29% year-over-year, demonstrating the strong leverage in our model, and KLA maintained industry-leading gross margins and operating margins of 62.8% and 43.6%, respectively. The company also grew free cash flow 30% to $4.4 billion and returned $3 billion in a combination of dividends and share buybacks.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nKLA's process control system revenue grew 19%, and our service business grew 15% for the year, and 2025 is expected to be another year of process control share growth for KLA. The demand for AI infrastructure, coupled with KLA's industry leadership and process control, positions the company well in supporting all major growth vectors in semiconductor manufacturing, including advanced logic, high bandwidth memory, and advanced packaging. The December quarter, KLA delivered strong results across the board, with revenue of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.85, and GAAP diluted EPS of $8.68. Highlights contributing to this performance include 17% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled by investment in leading-edge foundry logic and high bandwidth memory and DRAM. AI remains a core driver of KLA's performance and a key factor in our growing industry leadership.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nAs KLA's solutions enable our customers to deliver products needed for AI, our systems are also applying AI-driven analytics to deliver actionable insights that streamline chip manufacturing and accelerate innovation and time to yield for next-generation AI applications. We believe that our experience reflects the compelling capabilities, cost, and power consumption available with GPU-based compute architectures and is fueling the ongoing HPC infrastructure build-out. Looking ahead, KLA's innovations with AI will produce actionable data for our customers that accelerate system performance, reduce the cost of ownership, and improve their return on investment in KLA systems. In the December quarter, KLA continued to grow in advanced packaging. The rising demand for more powerful systems of chips is driving advanced packaging and increasing the value of process control in the chip package, which has fueled significant growth in this expanding market for KLA.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nKLA continues to see strong momentum in advanced packaging revenue growth and market share, with calendar 2025 total systems revenue of approximately $950 million, representing over 70% year-over-year growth. As we look forward to calendar 2026, we expect this momentum to continue with year-over-year percentage growth expectations in the mid- to high teens, driven by faster than market growth for our process control products. KLA Services business grew to $786 million in the December quarter, up 6% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. This was the 16th consecutive year of annual service revenue growth, with a compounded annual growth rate greater than 12% over that time frame. Finally, the December quarter remained strong for both free cash flow and capital returns. Quarterly free cash flow was a record $1.26 billion.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nTotal capital return in the December quarter was $797 million, comprised of $548 million in share repurchase and $250 million in dividends. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $3 billion. The industry dynamics to support the demand for AI infrastructure reinforce KLA's growing relevance for our customers, and our broad product portfolio plays a critical role in enabling customer success. Additionally, the emerging and fast-growing advanced packaging market further strengthens KLA's relative position. Finally, rising semiconductor content across diverse end markets, coupled with strategic investments in legacy nodes, remains a key driver of dependable, long-term growth for KLA and the semiconductor equipment industry. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren, to discuss the quarter's financial highlights.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThanks, Rick. KLA's December quarter results reflect strong year-over-year growth with an industry-leading margin profile. The results also exemplify our market leadership, consistent business execution, and the dedication of our global teams in meeting customer commitments. Revenue was $3.3 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $3.225 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.85, and GAAP diluted EPS was $8.68, each above the midpoint of the respective guidance ranges. Gross margin was 62.6%, 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, due to stronger than modeled service performance and manufacturing efficiencies. Operating expenses were $653 million and included $384 million in R&D and $269 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 42.8%. Other income and expense net was $32 million.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThe quarterly effective tax rate was 15%. At the guided tax rate of 14%, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $8.99. Non-GAAP net income was $1.17 billion. GAAP net income was $1.15 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.37 billion, and free cash flow was $1.26 billion. The company had 132 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable and end markets, and major products and regions, can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and debt of $5.9 billion.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThe company has a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile, supported by investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. KLA generates consistent, strong free cash flow, driven by our high-performing operating model. Over the past five years, free cash flow has grown at a 20% compound annual growth rate, above the 16% revenue compound annual growth rate over the same period. This growth, coupled with resiliency across business cycles, helps enable a comprehensive capital return strategy that features double-digit dividend growth and share repurchases to support long-term shareholder value creation. Turning to the outlook, the industry outlook for 2026 has strengthened over the past few months. We expect the core WFE market to grow in the high single- to low double-digit %, reaching the low $120 billion range, up from approximately $110 billion in 2025.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nIn addition, we expect the advanced packaging component of the market to grow at a similar rate to approximately $12 billion, for a total market forecast in the mid-$130 billion range, an increase in the low double digits versus our forecast for 2025. Customer spending profile is expected to broaden across all major end markets. Given KLA's strong business momentum, expanding market share, and higher process control intensity at the leading edge across all segments, we begin 2026 well positioned to outperform and increase our share of the overall market. We are experiencing strong customer momentum that has accelerated over the past 3 months and is reflected in our system backlog and sales funnel.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nOur view today is that the first half of 2026 revenue will grow mid-single digits compared to the second half of 2025, with accelerating growth in the second half of the calendar year. Customer lead times for our products are increasing due to supply constraints, limiting first half growth potential across many of our products. KLA's unique product portfolio differentiation and value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, accelerating process node capacity ramps, and ensuring yield entitlement and high volume manufacturing. Market environment and the complexity of our customers' technology roadmaps are compelling, presenting both challenges and opportunities for KLA to maintain its relative outperformance. In this industry environment, we remain focused on supporting customers, investing for the future, executing product roadmaps, and driving productivity across the enterprise.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nKLA's March quarter guidance is as follows: revenue of $3.35 billion ± $150 million. Foundry logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be consistent with the December quarter at approximately 60%, and memory is expected to be approximately 40% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be roughly 85% and NAND, the remaining 15%. As always, these business mix approximations pertain solely to our semiconductor customers and do not reflect our total semiconductor process control systems revenue. Gross margin for the quarter is forecasted to be 61.75% ± 1 percentage point. Although volume levels are relatively consistent quarter to quarter, product mix is modestly weaker versus the December quarter.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThis guidance also includes the incremental impact of the rapidly escalating cost of DRAM chips used in the company's image processing computers that ship with our systems, creating a headwind to our gross margin expectations. This pricing environment has changed profoundly over the past 2-3 months and has been highlighted regularly in industry press and analyst reports. While we expect this pricing environment to be transitory, current modeling suggests that this situation will persist through 2026 and have a roughly 75-100 basis points negative impact on gross margins for the calendar year. As DRAM capacity additions accelerate over the next several quarters, we expect this cost dynamic to improve as we exit the calendar year, and we are modeling a return to a normalized pricing environment for our memory requirements and our longer-term business forecasts.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nConsidering this impact, coupled with product mix and volume expectations, we expect gross margins to be approximately 62%, ±50 basis points, in calendar 2026. Operating expenses are forecasted to be approximately $645 million in the March quarter. For 2026, we continue to prioritize next-generation product development and company infrastructure investments to support expected revenue growth over the next several years, and we anticipate these expenses to grow by roughly $15 million sequentially throughout the year. Our business model is designed to deliver 40%-50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over the long run. Other model assumptions include other income and expense net of approximately $25 million for the March quarter and expected to remain at this quarterly level for the calendar year.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nFor taxes, our established practice is to provide an effective tax rate assumption for the calendar year when providing guidance for the March quarter. Given expectations of geographic distribution of revenue and profit, Pillar 2 adoption, and recent tax changes in the United States, the planning tax rate for 2026 is 14.5%. We would expect some quarter-to-quarter tax rate variance due to discrete items. For the March quarter, non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.08 ± $0.78, and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $8.85 ± $0.78. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 131.7 million shares. In conclusion, our near-term revenue guidance reflects consistent growth and relative strength.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nWe expect to outperform the market in 2026, driven by multiple tailwinds, driving rising process control intensity and growth in advanced packaging. KLA continues to focus on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and production efficiency objectives, which are driving our longer-term relevance and growth expectations. The KLA operating model guides our best-in-class execution. Our focus on customer success, innovative solutions, and operational excellence drives industry-leading financial performance, enabling us to return capital consistently and predictably. KLA's business is uniquely positioned to capitalize on today's technology inflections and growth drivers. We are encouraged by strengthening customer cost, confidence, and engagement, which informs our business forecast. The long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE and advanced packaging are compelling and represent a relative performance opportunity for KLA over the next several years.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nKLA's business has gone from being primarily indexed to leading-edge R&D investment and fab capacity ramp, to now addressing all growth phases in WFE and advanced packaging, enabling leading-edge process development, time to results in fab capacity ramps, and optimizing yield in a high-volume production environment. In addition, the growing investment in custom silicon, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of new, higher-value design starts and increased demand on our customers to deliver performance, volume, and time to market. As design mix and complexity grows, so does the need for advanced process control. As a result, KLA is seeing consistent growth in process control intensity, as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology, and yield optimization solutions. KLA is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends as we expand our market leadership and deliver differentiated value to our customers.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThat concludes our prepared remarks.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThank you, Brian. Operator, can you please provide the instructions and begin the Q&A session?\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. At this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may do so by pressing star two. We remind you to please unmute your line when introduced, and if possible, pick up your handset for optimal sound quality. In the interest of time, we ask you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. For the first one, you know, your overall forecast for WFE for this year. You know, yesterday, your peer reported and suggested that WFE could grow over 20%. I think they said 23%, and you're suggesting something in the high singles to low double. So I was hoping you could clarify what is kind of the apples-to-apples inclusion or exclusion? And then part of that, you know, you're suggesting advanced packaging only grows, I think, in that same pace, high single to low double. But that's very surprising given how fast the AI market is growing and just the correlation of that advanced packaging market to AI.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nSo basically, if you could just give us apples to apples, you know, why such a big disconnect between your view of WFE growth versus what your peers suggested yesterday?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nHey, Vivek, it's Brian. So I did talk about this a little bit in the letter, but I think one of the issues that has become a little bit noisy over the last couple of years has been the rise of advanced packaging as a market. And the inclusion of it in WFE forecast, and I think you and I talked about this in your conference back in June, was that, you know, that, you know, what do people exactly include in these numbers? And it varies a little bit across analysts and across companies.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nIf you look at our forecast, our view on consistent traditional core WFE in 2025 was around approximately, and we'll see how people report, but approximately $110 billion, and that the advanced packaging market, as we look at it, the total market, is roughly in that $11 billion range. So we'll call it the low $120s. As we look at 2026, looking at it in the same way, we see advanced packaging growing somewhere in excess of $12 billion. So, you know, it'll probably be in double digits. We'll see. It tends to be a quicker turn business, so we'll see how that plays out. And that core WFE is rising from $110, as we said, to about one—somewhere in the low $120s.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nSo I think when you add the two together, you end up in the mid-130s, which I think is consistent with what Lam said yesterday. But that's how to think about the market. I don't know how they think about it and what they include and what they don't. We try to capture all elements of the market as it relates to process and process control. And so that's how we look at it overall, in terms of what happens on the wafer, film frame, advanced component, and so on. So that's how we see it. Hopefully, that helps.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nAnd one back, Rick, just to add one part of that, the question on the growth of packaging. When we're talking to our customers, they are frustrated with the shelves that they have available. So part of what's slowing down the growth this year is their ability to have their factories built to support packaging because of the growth. So that's why we see it more—we'll see a lot more growth in 2027 as a result of that. There is demand, but I think it's a matter of getting the facilities ready, which is a theme generally right now with our customers.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nSo I think I'm going to go forward. We're just going to aggregate it, and I think maybe that helps. But what I tried to do was provide, over the last several months or so, some disaggregation, disaggregated view of what's traditional core WFE, the same WFE we've looked at over the last multiple decades, and what the advanced packaging market looks like as you add the two together. And you get to the mid-$30s, $130s, as we look at 2026.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nOkay. For my follow-up, just kind of two clarifications. One is, what's your assumption of China WFE, kind of absolute, you know, percentage growth? You know, how much was China WFE as part of that $120+ billion, in your definition, kind of all in WFE, how much was China? And then what are your assumptions about what China would do this year? And then how much are your supply constraints limiting your growth? Is there a way to quantify, right, how much growth you're kind of leaving on the table because of your. You know, where are those supply constraints, and how much are they limiting your growth this year? Thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nAll right, there's a lot in there. For China, our expectation is that China is flattish, maybe slightly positive, modest growth in 2026. It was modestly negative in 2025. For the company, as a percent of, as a percent of our revenue, we think it'll be somewhere in the mid-20% to high-20% range, as we look at it. I think if you look at the total China WFE, inclusive of the restricted fabs, we see China somewhere in the, we'll call it in the mid-, maybe mid-$30 billion range. Mid- to high-$30 billion range, in 2026.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nAnything on supply constraints?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nLook, I think as it relates to the first half, we're virtually sold out across most of our products. Given the lead time of our products, our decisions that we're driving the first half were decisions we made in the middle of 2025, generally. As we move into the second half, and as we talked about the prepared remarks, we see the second half accelerating versus the first half. We have a little bit more flexibility, but, you know, there are constraints in terms of what our customers are asking for. We're seeing our lead times extend. There are facility readiness dynamics that will play a role in terms of timing of shipments.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThe one good thing is that given all the new facility or greenfield visibility we have, it does give us pretty good confidence as we look out into 2027, and most of our conversations today about new orders are for deliveries late in 2026 and into 2027. So, it's pretty clear from a visibility point of view, we feel pretty good about our ability to ramp the business. I think if you look back to 2022, I think we did a pretty good job in terms of ramping to support a pretty robust environment.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nSo I think that, you know, those practices and our investments and how we manage our supply chain will play through in terms of our ability to satisfy demand as we look out over the next 12-24 months.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nHey, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Your core process control systems business delivered yet another strong year of WFE outperformance. I think it grew 20% versus 2025 WFE of, like, +10 to 12. Within this, inspection significantly outperformed yet again for, like, the third or I can't remember, fourth consecutive year, growing 25%, patterning growing 12%. How are you guys thinking about the growth in inspection and patterning relative to overall WFE view of sort of low-teens growth this year? I mean, given the focus on yield and manufacturability, would you expect a similar level or more of outperformance in process control for calendar 2026?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah, Harlan, it's Rick. Thank you. I think the -- recognizing the outperformance, I think we're feeling really good about the trends that we're seeing, especially in inspection and especially as they relate to the BBP products. And to Bren's point, I think, you know, we've been trying to add capacity in that product line, and probably, we're going to need it based on our conversations with customers. So I think there'll be continued growth, and everything about what we're seeing in the build-out for AI, Bren talked about the increased designs, the larger die, and now what we're seeing in HBM, which has become a huge driver.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nAnd in many ways, the bigger story is the change in intensity around memory has been pretty dramatic in terms of if we look back the last couple of years, and the heavy, heavy usage of advanced inspection to support that. So it's good. I mean, it -- we're looking at a modeling as we go forward, and our customers have told us 2026 is expansion, and setting the stage for even more expansion in 2027. And so we think we'll continue to see strong growth associated with that. I think that the capacity -- I mean, metrology is historically a little closer tied to some of the capacity, so, you know, we'll see some relative recovery.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nAnd then reticle is going to be very strong, because it's so tied to the number of design starts and the challenges associated with advanced masks. Bren, am I missing anything?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, I think to your question about relative performance, I think despite the you know, more mix related to memory, as Rick talked about, our performance in HBM is changing the intensity profile. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to sustain the multiyear outperformance that we've seen. So, I think it's pretty exciting. The portfolio is in a really good place from an overall share point of view, and we're seeing intensity rise in a number of markets. So we feel pretty good about it.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nGreat. Thank you for that. And for my follow-up, you know, it's pretty well understood that on all these new sort of advanced technology transitions, you do need a lot more inspection and metrology capabilities, right? But on top of that, you know, given the industry's chip supply tightness, your customers are looking to even further squeeze more supply for a given sort of current installed base. I'm wondering, is this—and so their, their focus, you know, just as much on technology transition, but on the existing capacity footprint, trying to drive more supply via yield improvements, better manufacturability. I'm wondering if this is also driving incremental demand for your process control solution?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, certainly. I mean, we have seen, in some cases, back penetration of technologies once the recognition was that two things have happened. In some cases, you know, if you go back in time, they'd move from one technology to the next and not really pay much attention to the prior. Now, there's more demand at the prior, and if they're getting advantages in the capabilities in the latest technology node, we see back penetration to squeeze out, to your point, more yield. Right now, because of the constraints, and I think if you, when we talk to all our customers, we hear a common theme, is they're constrained by the ability to build new fabs and new shelves.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nMm-hmm.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nBut to your point, they're, for the most part, trying to do everything they can to optimize. And then the pricing environment is such for them that, that additional yield is worth more, and so that's the other factor that's, that's driving them.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nThanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Analyst)\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just kind of understand the supply constraints that you're seeing in the first half. Any way that you can kind of help us understand just, you know, what could growth have potentially kind of been first half or second half if you didn't have those supply constraints? And then, is it mostly just DRAM, or is it also other components, like optics and things?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWell, Joe, Joe, the biggest long lead time aspect of our bill of materials is an optical component. So to my earlier point about the lead time for that tends to be pretty long. So that does, you know, we're, like I said, we were making decisions last summer that was affecting what we expect to ship in the first half of the year. So that's probably the biggest factor. We don't really look at what we could have done. Certainly, in the last few months, we've seen a strengthening from customers for more demand in the first half. And so, I mean, the good thing about our differentiation and our market position is that we can balance pretty well across our customers to make sure that we're trying to meet their needs.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nAt the same time, we're not, you know, we're not missing business or losing business. So, our lead times are extending. Our customers know that, and so, we're managing it accordingly. So I don't-- but I don't think, you know, I go, \"Oh, I could have done this, or I could have done that.\" It's, you know, what can you do? And so, you know, I think that that's the nature of our conversations with customers, and then we look to improve as we can. As we move in the second half of 2026, we will see the business accelerate.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWould expect, you know, second half to, you know, have, you know, high single, maybe low double-digit type growth, as we move into the second half of the year. I think as an industry, you have to remember, if we moved independently, if we could supply everything everybody wanted right away, it still would be a limit. There are other factors that limit their ability to ramp these fabs. So our customers, when we talk to them, are having the same conversation with our peers that they're having with us, because collectively, they need all the equipment in order to be able to ramp. And so the frustration for a lot of them now is they've got demand, and in some cases, they don't even have the ability to build the shelves as fast as they want and then fill it out.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nSo to Bren's point, you know, collectively, we're all being asked to accelerate equipment delivery, but it's not really because we don't have BBP that we're missing out. It's part of their overall solution. So when we talk to them, they really want to prioritize where, when they get that equipment to be able to facilitate it. But we're not going to lose share because of it.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Analyst)\nThat's helpful. And then as a follow-up, just trying to understand, like, the kind of trajectory of gross margin. I mean, it seems like maybe based on the guidance, March is kind of the bottom, and we move higher from here. And anything you can share on just the ability to, like, pass through higher component costs or reprice your backlog?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah. So, I think you're right. It looks like March is probably the low point for the year as that goes, and as we move across the year, we'll see it increment up. We're going to be-- you know, our first priority as it relates to memory supply is securing supply to ensure that we can meet our delivery commitments and support our customers. That's our primary focus. We'd also expect that the tariff burden as we progress through 2026, given some of the process things we're doing within the company, will also diminish in terms of its impact. I talked about a 50-100 basis point impact related to tariffs.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWe're closer to the top end of that range today, and we'll see that come down, I think, over time. So as it relates, I thought it was important to give you some sense of it in terms of the expectations for the year, 62% ± 50 basis points. We think the memory situation is transitory. And really, as it relates to how we price our products, it's much more of a value-oriented pricing model, and less about cost movement, particularly around commodities.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nSo it's important that we continue to maintain the product cadence that we have in terms of launching new products and variants of new products, and that gives us an opportunity to enhance our cost of ownership offering to our customers, add new capability, and also take into consideration some of these dynamics around costs that we've been dealing with for some time, starting with some of the pretty significant inflation just a few years ago to this issue today. So that's how we're thinking about it right now.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Analyst)\nHelpful. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThanks, Joe.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. C.J., if you muted your phone, please unmute.\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Analyst)\nApologies. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on gross margins, you know, how are you thinking about the progression, you know, through the year, you know, given the overall guide of 62%? And then, you know, more importantly, you know, I guess, what are your thoughts around 2027 and, you know, the ability to kind of pass along the higher DRAM costs, which I don't assume will go away anytime soon. And I guess as you deliver kind of newer products, you know, what impact would should that have on incremental gross margins into next year?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah. So over the course of the rest of this year, I think that margins, you know, look, product mix is probably the biggest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability, but I would expect gross margins to trend north. Part of it being our expectations around mix here, but also expected increases in overall volume. So I think that there's some scale benefits that we'll see that will flow through. Over the long run, I feel pretty comfortable with, as we talked about, our, you know, our model that we presented at our last Investor Day of 63% plus type gross margin profile. I feel still very good about that, and given the mix of our business, the growth rates of service and so on.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nSo I think as we look into 2027, I would expect to see, you know, gross margins continue on, on kind of an incremental cadence from where they are. And, you know, I feel pretty good about, you know, 63%+ at, as we go forward and we see some normalization in, in some of these cost areas.\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Analyst)\nVery helpful. And then wanted to focus on DRAM. I think your share of wallet historically has been kind of 7, 8, 9%, depending on the year. But curious now with HBM, particularly as we evolve to HBM4 and HBM4E, you know, how do you see that share kind of progressing in 2026 and 2027? Thanks so much.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nSure. I think, technologically, there's a lot of reasons to explain why we're seeing higher adoption. One, we talked about before, is less redundancy. The value of these devices is, is higher, so there's a less willingness to give away real estate to redundancy. There's because you got to move so much data in and out, there's more metallization layers, which require more inspection, and then there is the increased use of, of the, advanced lithography, which requires an EUV, more inspection. So all those things are driving up the intensity of DRAM, and it, it looks much more similar to what logic did not that long ago. So I think all those issues are, are driving that, and we feel really good about that going forward as we're engaging with customers, and they're seeing the benefits of...\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nFor many of them, they haven't been employing a lot of process control like this and most of their working lifetime. So we're seeing them getting used to that and coming to us for more capability. I think the other thing is the process variability, flexibility in the past, depending on end market, was something that customers could bin devices, and it with high-performance compute they don't have the ability to do that. So that's driving more rigor around ensuring that each of the devices in the stacks performs to pretty tight specs. The demand environment is also driving opportunities in our service business as customers, you know, look to keep these tools up to have maximum uptime to ensure good performance, where in the past, with redundancy you might see less contract penetration.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWe think it's a growth opportunity here moving forward, given the nature of these devices and their requirements.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you, C.J.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Shane Moore with Morgan Stanley.\n\n**Shane Moore** (Analyst)\nThank you for letting me ask a question. My first question, I just wanted to follow up on C.J.'s question earlier, but you've previously talked about DRAM process control intensity increasing 100 basis points with EUV and another 100 basis points with HBM. But is there a world in which DRAM process control intensity just really gets close to advanced logic? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWell, it's still a ways away from advanced logic, given the high mix of designs. And so that's, I think, the biggest issue that you see in advanced logic that's different than memory. So we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing. We'll see how this plays out with more EUV layers and so on, in DRAM devices. So we think that it's just the market requirements are driving more inspection, more metrology, and we think that will be a positive trend. I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to something that looks like advanced logic, just given the nature of those devices and the differences in a logic fab versus memory.\n\n**Shane Moore** (Analyst)\nGot it. My follow-up is on Foundry Logic. You've called out a broadening of foundry customers over the last year, and it's clearly materializing with your customers' CapEx announcements. Could you talk about the process control intensity at these customers, and just how good can leading-edge logic for you be this year? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nI'll start and then let Bren fill in. We are seeing the broadening. We're definitely seeing the intensity. I think to Bren's point, there's a couple of factors that you have to look at, maybe three, really. One is the technology node, and a big factor is die size, and then another one is the mix. And so if you have a company that's doing advanced logic, but they're not on large die and they're not high mix, that intensity is just not going to be as high as if you have somebody that's doing all three. But it's higher than it's been, and in order to be competitive, they're increasing it.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nSo we kind of model that going forward, and that's and we'll lay this out in a lot more detail when we look at our 2030 conversation at the Analyst Day. But we are seeing it going up for this year. And there's when we talk to our customers in advanced logic, even they are talking about it depends. It depends on if they get more customers, it depends on how much more capacity they need, then their investments will follow based on that. So it's a little hard for us to judge what that's going to end up being.\n\n**Shane Moore** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you, Shane.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nMid-single digits, half on half versus the back half of last year. But I think you made a comment answering a question about high single digits-\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nTim, Tim, Tim. Do you mind starting over? I think, when you began your question, you were kind of, like, right in the middle, so we didn't pick up the start of the question, and I didn't want you to finish and then have to do it again, if you don't mind.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nPerfect. Okay. Okay, perfect. So, Bren, we know you said the first half of this year is going to be at mid-singles versus the back half of last year. So we know what June is. June's, like, $3.6 and change. I think in answering a question, you said high singles to low doubles, and I think you meant the back half of the year. Is that a half-on-half comment? Because that would sort of imply that the calendar back half would be something like $7.5 billion. And I, like, I ask because that's not up that much versus the $3.6 that you're saying for June.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nTim, yeah, so that was a half-to-half statement I said. So we'll see how it plays out, right? I'm not going to guide specifically with more detail. I tried to give you a sense of, you know, this, our expectations of growth in the second half of the year. And, you know, I think it's, you know, likely in that, you know, that sort of high single, low double range for now. So, we'll see how things play out as we move forward.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nOkay. And then advanced packaging. I think, unless I look back through the transcripts, I thought last quarter on the October call, I thought the expectation was that the Advanced Packaging market this year would grow more than 20%. And now I think you're saying mid- to high-teens %. Did the market downtick, or did stuff pull in? Or, you know, maybe I'm just parsing numbers, but I'm just kind of wondering if, like, something changed. Thanks.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nNo, we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing in the market. It, it, you know, it, it's not a large market, so the percentages can, can move around a fair amount. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing from a, from a share point of view across the market. So, you know, we'll, we'll see. I, you know, I tried to provide some context. I think it's, you know, it's likely in that, you know, we'll call it 10%-20% range, and so that's why, you know, we said what we said. What's interesting about our process control position in that market, if you go back to... 2021 in process control, we were roughly 10% of that market. That, that overall market was what I called a rounding error in terms of how you thought about WFE.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nBut now, as you look at the size of the market and the opportunity that's there, it is now becoming part of what's called, what I think is, you know, this core, overall equipment market. Our share was, you know, down in the 10% range. I think when you look at 2025, we're close to half the market in share, and I think in 2026, we feel pretty good about our prospects moving forward. So, it's a great opportunity. There's a lot of advancements that's happening there. Sampling rates are high, so and we have a broader portfolio that we think customers will start to leverage, more as we move forward. So, it's a pretty, I think, exciting market.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYou know, we have great drivers within what I call traditional WFE, and we have this evolving SAM that we think will augment our growth here moving forward.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nOkay. Thanks, Brad.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Casso with Wolfe Research.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nYes, thank you. I guess first question would be characterizing the relative growth of memory versus Foundry Logic for this year. And I recognize that, you know, a lot of that probably has to do with clean room space constraints, as you said. But, you know, how do you think it shapes up for this year, and then particularly in the second half of the year, as some of the revenue starts to improve?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nWell, we think that you know, certainly the DRAM part of the market will grow faster than Foundry Logic will grow, be driven mostly by the demands for HBM, but also, as we talked about, the challenges in conventional memory as well. So the way we're modeling is, you know, we think overall Foundry Logic is up you know, 10%-15% for the year from a WFE point of view, and that you know, the DRAM part of the market is probably you know, 15%-20% versus last year. Flash, a little harder to pin. I think it's slower than DRAM. It's off a lower base, so you know, a lower number.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nBut I think the biggest, at least from our point of view, I mean, certainly the biggest drivers for WFE this year and from a growth point of view overall, is what's happening in advanced logic and what we're seeing in the DRAM market.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nThank you. As a follow-up, I think you've talked about 12%-14% kind of normalized service growth. Given the rising utilization rates, the fact that the folks are a bit tight now, how does that affect the service growth for both 2026 and as you kind of start into 2027?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nWell, there's a number of factors that are driving growth, certainly to your point, I mean, higher utilizations. I mean, our tools tend to, tend to stay very well utilized, no matter where customer overall utilizations are, because it's the best way to manage capital, even in downturns, is to drive yield. So our customers, in terms of how they buy our systems, is they, they buy them, they run them at very high uptime, and the value is, is, is in the performance of the systems and matching performance in terms of information on defectivity and metrology and so on. So the growth expectations of the growing install base, this install base living longer.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nOpportunities for where things are tighter in the market, opportunities around memory, as I talked about earlier, opportunities in packaging, and then growing streams in our acquired businesses, where we think we can leverage the infrastructure of KLA to drive revenue, revenue growth, and service out of acquired businesses. Those are all our vectors for growth here moving forward. So we feel very confident about the 12%-14% go-forward target model for service revenue, and I think there are a lot of drivers that suggest we can operate at the higher end of the range versus the lower over time.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThank you, Chris.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Analyst)\nThanks. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit more precision, following on the last question. Do you expect that, I mean, clearly, you expect, DRAM to be stronger in the short term, but do you expect the growth in foundry logic to actually expand substantially into the back half of the year, such that those growth rates would be closer to matched or, or not? I'm just trying to think about how that plays out in terms of, process control intensity for you over the course of this year. Thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, so I can't comment exactly on where the overall industry levels will be. I mean, certainly, as it relates to KLA's business, I would expect the foundry logic part of our business to be, you know, kind of stronger in the second half than in the first half right now. But it is, you know, I think it's pretty fluid, and there's, I think, kind of consistent growth expectations, you know, half to half across both segments.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWell, we know from public comments some of our customers have made, that they are definitely facility constrained, right? So their ability to ramp, I'm sure they're gonna do everything they can to pull that in, but I think we're gonna see in the foundry logic space, you know, the setup for 2027 is pretty remarkable. And we'll see more, I think, late in 2026 as they have the opportunity. But there, there's a lot of discussions already about preparing us, the equipment supply companies, for 2027.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Analyst)\nThat's helpful. And relative to the China market, you outlined your expectations for WFE growth there. But I'm wondering, in terms of the competitive landscape, you have a very, very strong portfolio, sort of, across the board in your product space. Have you heard any kind of incremental interest from your customers in China or from the government in terms of promoting more onshore solutions there? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWell, I think that, you know, to the degree where we can compete, we continue to offer capabilities that our customers want. I think the biggest constraint we have, and the biggest challenge we have sometimes in China, is when we're not permitted to sell, but alternative non-US companies are permitted to sell to the same customers, and those are conversations we've had with the government. We're not gonna opine on those decisions overall, which companies are on that list. In terms of competition from China, I think there's been more progress made, quite a bit more in the process tools than there has been in either lithography or in process control, partly, largely because of the technology required to do that. So, we feel pretty good about competing anywhere in the world, including China.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWhat we push for in the cases where we've had some unfair disadvantages, we just want a level playing field as it pertains to actions taken by the government.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\n\n**Robert Burns** (Analyst)\nHi, this is Robert Burns on the line for Chris. Thank you for taking my questions. I know you've talked a good amount on some of the previous questions, but just in terms of these capacity constraints, are there any areas of the market that are larger pain points in your ability to ship tools to? And any areas where potentially you could be constrained and would need more capacity, you know, once Foundry Logic takes off more in calendar year 2027?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nI mean, if you think about, this is Rick, if you think about our portfolio, we, by and large, ship the same products, same kind of products for advanced technologies, whether it's memory or foundry logic. So it's not like we're constrained on to support the memory guys or the logic guys. It's more the thing Brent talked about, where optics is an example, where you only have so much capacity over time, and you can, you can add it, but you can't add it quickly because it takes a lot of work to, to increase the number of the output of very complex optics. So it's more product specific to our products than it is customer specific.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nAnd I guess the only other thing I'd add to that is, what's driving the market today is really, you know, leading-edge demand. And so, you know, it isn't like we, you know, when we went through 2023 and 2024 with more legacy products, where you had a broader mix of products. What customers want today are leading-edge solutions, and so that's where most of the focus is.\n\n**Robert Burns** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you. And then, your DRAM shipments were particularly strong this quarter. I think you had mentioned in the last call you expected them to be up, but were there any shifts in your view over the quarter, and what sort of demand visibility do you have into that market for this year?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah, as, as we said earlier, I mean, certainly over the last few months, we've seen, you know, fundamentals of overall equipment spending strengthen and certainly a desire by our customers to get tools sooner rather than later. So we've tried to manage our way around that, and the demand is broad-based. So I would say that overall demand has strengthened in the last few months in that part of the market. Frankly, all markets, frankly.\n\n**Robert Burns** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThank you, Robert.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nHi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, I want to ask Jim's question a slightly different way. So you, you gave the guidance for the first half, which kind of gives me June. And again, if I'm modeling, you said high single to low double, the second half would be up, you know, call it 10%. That would put it... My math suggests that kind of total revenue's up, I don't know, 12, 13%, which is about what you're suggesting the whole WFE market is growing. So like, you, you said you're gaining share, so why wouldn't that number be higher? Like, where is the share gains, given that, half-over-half in the second half that you're talking about?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWell, so Stacy, I mean, part of this is the blended numbers, right? So you're getting that. You know, when we talk about share gain, overall, we're looking at our semiconductor process control business in terms of its relative performance against the- Uh-huh ... the total equipment market. So, so there is that. You know, again, I'll allow you to do the work. I'm not gonna guide the full year to that level of precision. I will say that we feel very good about our ability to grow faster than the market. And, you know, you've got service element, you've got our non-semi elements that are- Yeah ... you know, are also factors in our overall growth rate.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nOkay, because, I mean, services is growing about that much as well. You said 12%-14%, and I just, I just feel like that, that half over half, and maybe there's just conservatism built into it, but it feels like... Like I said, call it 10% or whatever, feels light. Anyways, so my second question, just around China, you know, the last time you reported it was after the affiliate rule had been put in place and before it was taken off.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\n... What are your thoughts on, I guess, recovery of that revenue, and like how does that bake in to your thoughts on China revenue next year? Because I, to my mind, like your, I don't know if your China guidance for next year now is higher than it was last quarter or not, but, presumably some of that affiliate revenue should be coming back.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, I would have, I think back three months ago, we thought China'd be, you know, modestly down, and now I think it's going to be up for us this year. So that business has, you know, come back in and feathered through, is in our forecast and some of the commentary we've provided here.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nHow much was that again? It was, I can't remember, $300 million or $350 million? I can't remember.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, in that ballpark. I mean, some service elements, but yeah-\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nOkay.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nIn that ballpark.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nGot it. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We do have time for one additional questioner. We'll take our final question from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As I look out, you talk about more share gains. Where should I be paying attention? Is that more on the leading-edge Foundry Logic side? Is that more in the advanced packaging side? Just because to Stacy's question, right, like, you're talking about a core WFE that you're growing in line with. Maybe you're being a little conservative to start the year and end up beating that as we go along. But I would imagine if you include advanced packaging as well, that's an area where you've had a lot of strength. So, I would imagine that would accelerate the growth rate. Maybe explain where you're seeing those share gains. Is it more so on the AP side or on the leading-edge Foundry Logic side?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nWell, we're certainly seeing share gains in AP, as I talked about earlier. I think there's a lot of positive momentum there. I think we've done extremely well in Logic, and I think there's a lot of momentum on the memory side. As it relates to the overall business, I wouldn't say, you know, our share is pretty consistent across the different segments. I mean, so it really comes down to our products. Our reticle inspections had a really strong year. We think that that's part of the markets inflecting. We're doing pretty well there. We see some positive momentum in our electron beam businesses, and so we think that that's a positive here moving forward as well.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nSo I think between what's happening in packaging, what's happening in E-beam, what's happening in reticle, and our largest, you know, businesses, like our Broadband Plasma business or our high-end pattern inspection, it's a market that's growing faster, and we have a strong share. So we'll influence the overall share numbers just because of the relative growth rate of that segment versus other parts of the market. So those are the areas we feel pretty good about our share position here in 2025, in terms of gaining share, and we think that, you know, we'll continue to increment what has been... It was a really strong share position.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nWe'll continue to increment here moving forward, given the nature of the portfolio, and our ability to compete, meeting customers' technical requirements and their cost requirements, being able to leverage the network effect across the systems. So we think that is, you know, enhances our competitive offerings and positions us well here moving forward from a share point of view.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Analyst)\nSuper helpful. And if I may, just a really quick follow-up. Your competitor talked about the different vectors of market growth, and said, Foundry Logic, good growth, DRAM, good growth, but NAND a bit below that. I was curious if you agree with that assessment when you look at the broader market, and then, obviously, you're hearing some NAND guys report tonight, maybe talking a bit more aggressively about spend. Do you think that as this year goes along, maybe that view can change if you see an acceleration a bit more quickly on the NAND side from a technology transition perspective or some greenfield capacity? I know it's a smaller business for you, but interested in your thoughts.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI think the challenge, given the constraints in the industry around how much can actually be supplied, you know, any new demand that's showing up today, as I said earlier, in terms of our conversations with customers, is more about 27 deliveries. Also, they're not a competitor, they're a peer. We have enough competitors, thank you.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Analyst)\nThanks, Tom.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you, Tom. All right. I wanted just to thank everyone for their time. I know it's a very busy earnings season and a very busy earnings day. We look forward to seeing, hopefully, many of you at our investor day in New York on March the twelfth. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for any final instructions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes the KLA Corporation- Bye.\n\n**Operator**\nDecember quarter 2025 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGood afternoon, my name is Stephanie and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2025 Post Earnings Conference Call. All participant lines have been placed on listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question at that time, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star 2. Please limit yourself to one question and then feel free to requeue for any follow-up questions. Lastly, should you need assistance during the conference today, please press star zero. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA. Please go ahead.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations)\nWelcome to the September 2025 quarterly earnings call. I'm joined by our CEO Rick Wallace and our CFO Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results as well as our December quarter outlook, which was released after the market closed and is available on our website along with the supplemental materials. We are presenting today's discussion and metrics on a non-GAAP financial basis. Unless otherwise specified, all full year references made refer to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future events, presentations, corporate governance information, and links to our SEC filings. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations)\nOur actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. We will begin the call with Rick providing commentary on the business environment and our quarter, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Before I turn the call over to Rick, I wanted to provide a save the date for our investor day. It has been rescheduled for Thursday, March 12, 2026, in New York. Now over to Rick.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you, Kevin. To kick off our call today, I'll cover a few highlights from our quarter that showcase how the company is benefiting from the growing relevance of process control and AI infrastructure investment and our momentum in advanced packaging. KLA delivered strong results across the board in the September quarter with revenue of $3.21 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.81. GAAP diluted EPS was $8.47.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThis performance demonstrates how KLA's process control leadership has expanded beyond leading-edge R&D investment to address all growth markets in WFE, including high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. Accelerating investment in scaling AI infrastructure is fueling technology development investment across the leading edge, driving more designs, increased complexity, shorter product cycles, and higher value wafers. Alongside this growth, the industry is also seeing rising demand for advanced packaging. In this complex environment of rapid AI technology development, process control accelerates time to results by resolving process integration challenges during the fab ramp up phase to optimize time to market for a diverse mix of semiconductor designs. KLA's leading edge customers are also challenged to optimize yield and limit process variability in high volume production environment, resulting in increasing process control intensity.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nIn this increasingly complex semiconductor device technology landscape, we're seeing rapid growth in demand for KLA's advanced packaging portfolio, which has emerged as a meaningful market for the company. As heterogeneous device integration has become more complex, KLA's advanced packaging systems revenue continues to gain momentum through a combination of intensity gains and market share improvements across our portfolio. For calendar year 2025, we expect advanced packaging related revenue to exceed $925 million, up approximately 70% year over year. Satellite service business also continues to deliver strong growth. Services grew to $745 million in the September quarter, up 6% sequentially and 16% year over year. Consistency and resiliency are hallmarks of the KLA service business. Finally, the September quarter was strong on both cash flow and capital returns front. Strong cash flow in the quarter was at a record of $1.066 billion over the past 12 months.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nFree cash flow was $3.9 billion with a free cash flow margin of 31%. Total capital return in the September quarter was $799 million, comprised of $545 million in share repurchases and $254 million in dividends. Total capital return over the past 12 months was $3.09 billion. In summary, KLA business has both enabled and benefits from today's technology inflections and the growth drivers related to AI as well as from growth in advanced packaging. KLA's business has gone from being primarily indexed to leading edge R&D investments and foundry logic customers to now addressing all growth markets in WFE including memory, advanced packaging, and leading edge and legacy node logic.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nAs we look ahead over the next several years, the long term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE and advanced packaging are compelling and represent a relative performance opportunity for KLA in this dynamic growth environment. Our consistent execution reflects the resilience, the KLA operating model, the strength of our global team, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation focused on long term investment and maximizing total shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren to discuss the quarter's financial highlights.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThanks Rick. KLA September quarter results reflect double digit year over year growth and improved profitability. Revenue was $3.21 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $3.15 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.81 and GAAP diluted EPS was $8.47, each above the midpoint of the respective guidance ranges.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nGross margin was 62.5%, 50 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, driven by a stronger product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $618 million. Operating expenses included $360 million in R&D and $258 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43.2%. Other income and expense, net, was a $28 million expense with upside to guidance principally driven by a favorable mark to market adjustment on a strategic supplier investment. The quarterly effective tax rate was 14.1%. Net income was $1.17 billion, GAAP net income was $1.12 billion, cash flow from operations was $1.16 billion, and free cash flow was $1.07 billion. The breakdown of revenue by reportable and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nMoving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $5.9 billion in debt. The company has a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. A cornerstone of KLA's business is consistent, strong free cash flow generation driven by one of the best operating models in the industry and a predictable, highly differentiated service business. This helps drive a comprehensive capital return strategy that includes consistent dividend growth and increasing share repurchases over the long term. Our actions this year emphasize our commitment to capital returns and our confidence in KLA's long term shareholder value accretion. On April 30, 2025, we announced the 16th consecutive annual dividend increase of 12% to $1.90 per share per quarter, or an annualized dividend of $7.60 per share.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nAlong with this action, we also announced a $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Turning to the outlook, it continues to be driven by increasing investment in leading edge logic, HBM, and advanced packaging. Growth of advanced packaging supporting heterogeneous chip integration has led to a new meaningful served market for KLA. What was once a rounding error in wafer fab equipment is now, according to KLA internal estimates, an approximately $11 billion market growing faster than core WFE. This is particularly true as chip densities shrink and the processing required for packaging creates risk for our customers. For KLA, this creates a new served available market that will augment the company's revenue growth over the next several years. The market and technology roadmap for leading edge WFE supporting high performance compute is driving relative inflections for process control.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThis opportunity, coupled with the evolving complexity of advanced packaging, supports an even broader market opportunity for KLA. As we approach the close of calendar 2025, we continue to expect mid to high single digit growth in WFE, modestly improved from our previous outlook discussed last quarter. Growth in 2025 is being driven principally by increasing investment in both leading edge foundry logic and memory to support growing AI and premium mobile demand, partially offset by lower demand from domestic China. Given KLA's business momentum, expanding market share opportunities, and higher process control intensity at the leading edge across all segments, we remain on track to outperform the WFE market in 2025. The advanced packaging market is also expected to grow more than 20% compared to last year.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nFinally, customer discussions have become more constructive on expectations for calendar year 2026 to be a growth year for the industry with a broader spending profile than 2025 for both WFE and advanced packaging. While it is still too early to provide precise calendar 2026 revenue guidance, our view today is that first half revenue levels will be roughly flat to up compared to the second half of calendar 2025, with accelerating growth in the second half of the calendar year. This outlook is inclusive of the revenue impact related to additional market access loss related to certain customers in China resulting from extended export controls from the U.S. government. We estimate the revenue impact on the December quarter and calendar 2026 to be approximately $300 million to $350 million for KLA.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nFor calendar 2026, this impact is spread roughly evenly across the first and second half of the calendar year. KLA's unique product portfolio differentiation and value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, accelerating process node capacity ramps, and ensuring yield entitlement and high volume production. The market environment and the complexity of our customers' technology roadmaps are compelling and bring challenges and opportunities for KLA to continue its relative performance in this industry environment. KLA remains focused on supporting customers, investing for the future, executing product roadmaps, and driving productivity across the enterprise. KLA's December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $3.225 billion plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 59% and memory is expected to be approximately 41%.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nSemiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 78% and NAND the remaining 22%. As always, these business mix approximations pertain solely to our semiconductor customers and do not fully reflect our total semiconductor process control systems revenue. Gross margin is forecasted to be 62% plus or minus 1 percentage point based on relatively consistent factory output versus the September quarter and product mix revenue expectations. Operating expenses are forecasted to be approximately $635 million in the December quarter as we continue to make product development and infrastructure investments to support expected revenue growth. Given our expectations for company growth and product development roadmap requirements, we will maintain our operating expense trajectory. Our business model is designed to deliver 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over the long run.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nOther model assumptions include other income and expense net of approximately $32 million expense. For the December quarter, the effective tax rate assumption has risen slightly to 14% reflecting the impact of recent global tax changes. For the December quarter, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $8.46 plus or minus $0.78 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.70 plus or minus $0.78. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 132 million shares. In conclusion, our near term revenue guidance shows modest growth and is consistent with our views from the start of the year of relative top line stability. We expect to meaningfully outperform the mid to high single digit WFE growth rate in 2025 driven by rising process control intensity inclusive of the significant growth of the advanced packaging market.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nALA focuses on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements, which are driving our longer term relevance and growth expectations. KLA's business is well positioned for today's technology inflections and growth drivers. We are encouraged by the customer engagement that informs our business forecast. Long term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE and advanced packaging are compelling and represent a relative performance opportunity for KLA over the next several years. In addition, the growing investment in custom Silicon Valley, particularly among hyperscalers developing their own custom chips, has led to a proliferation of unique device designs and increased demand on our customers to deliver performance, volume, and time to market. As design complexity and diversity grow, so does the need for advanced process control.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nAs a result, KLA has seen growth in process control intensity as each new chip design requires rigorous inspection, metrology, and yield optimization solutions. ALA is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends as we expand our market leadership and deliver differentiated value to our customers. That concludes our prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q and A.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations)\nOperator, I'm sorry, I was just going to pass it over to you to start the process. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nApologies for that. Thank you. At this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may do so by pressing Star two. We remind you to please unmute your line when introduced, and if possible, please pick up your handset for optimal sound quality. In the interest of time, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, you may requeue, and we'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nGood afternoon guys and congratulations on the strong quarterly execution. You know last quarter you had this early view given your lead times, customer discussions on calendar 2016, a growth year. You reiterated that today but talked about being more constructive on that growth rate. With another 90 days of visibility, given that Leading Edge design starts are continuing to expand at a rapid pace, the recent and significant AI data center infrastructure announcements, has the magnitude on the WFE growth outlook improved or is it more just confidence level on the growth that you were thinking about 90 days ago? You mentioned a broader spending profile on WFE and advanced packaging. Can you guys just elaborate on that a little bit?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nSure Harlan, I'll start. Thank you for the comments.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI don't know if it's really a strengthening outlook as much as it's just, you know, we're getting closer to IT customers, particularly our longstanding customers and their lead time expectations. We're starting to get more constructive about exact timing. We're encouraged by what we're seeing certainly for KLA at the leading edge with a broadening level of investment. We think that's going to be positive. On leading edge foundry logic, DRAM is also constructive and with the investments in HBM that's been very process control intensive and so that's been a really good sign as well. Flash market is, I think, continues to grow. Rest of the legacy market, I'm not so sure there's much growth there and I think we'll have a little bit of a correction in China.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nObviously we're feeling the effects of some new control that's impacting our view into next year, but we were expecting China to normalize anyway. As we look at it all, we're pretty constructive on WFE growth rising in capital intensive process control intensity and packaging has a lot of momentum both in terms of intensity but also share. We feel pretty good about what's in front of us and we'll have a lot more to say specifically about growth in the industry and our expectations for KLA beyond what we said in the comments. We'll have a lot more to say when we report for December and January.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nOne thing Harlan, just to add to Bren's comment. What we do see and kind of feel is body language from customers pretty strong in terms of wanting to make sure they're securing slots.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWe're having kind of conversations with people not wanting us to get away from them because they're worried that they may not be able to achieve their objectives if they don't line us up. I suspect that's across the other equipment guys too.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nGot it. I appreciate that. Specifically on advanced foundry and logic, in addition to the increased process control intensity as the industry moves from 2 nanometer to less than 2 nanometer, there's an added dynamic where your foundry customers are standing up fabs in totally new geographies. More uncertainty on yield ramps, systematic defects, different type of workforce. On the advanced logic side, the large guy here is more focused on building out a world class foundry business which means way more focus on yield and manufacturability versus their historical trend.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nWondering if these additional dynamics are driving the potential for incremental process control spend as you look into next year.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI do think that as the customers are dealing with the new design rules and some of them especially are maybe back in it, if you will, trying to do leading edge. They're benchmarking what do they need for process control and we're seeing very constructive conversations around that. I think that's true. I think it's kind of filling out the rest of the players, if you will, in terms of how they're thinking about investment and process control. Yes, I'd say that strengthens if there are more players doing more leading edge in more locations, that's going to be accretive to overall intensity. One of the themes over the last couple of years has obviously been significant investment augmented by China and legacy design rules.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nWhen you think about leading edge, leading edge was tremendously efficient with most of the investment being really driven by one of our customers. I think as you start to see a broadening out there, it creates more opportunities for leading edge engagement, process control intensity, as a lot of the strategic investment happens to support what is an accelerating growth opportunity for our customers. I think we're encouraged by that profile as we move forward.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nThanks, Rick. Thanks, Dwayne.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Sourabh Arya with Bank of America.\n\n**Saurabh Arya** (Analyst)\nThanks for taking that question. On the foundry/logic side, you are, I think, guiding it to decline to 59% from 74% of sales at least, or a decline of over $300 million sequentially. I'm curious what's causing this drop? How much of this is the China restriction? How much of this is the China impact? Is this kind of just a 1/4 lumpiness or is there more to read into it as we look into the first half of next year?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah. So Vivek, for our semiconductor customers on the mix side, on the leading edge, it's upticking in the December quarter, but it's being offset by a reduction in China. China was elevated in September at 39%.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nJust for a reference point, our expectations for the total year for China, and I have been pretty consistent with this for the last nine months or so, as we thought it would be somewhere in that 30% plus or minus range. It was a little bit elevated versus the annual trend. As China comes down, part of that is you have leading edge going up and then you also have memory, as particularly in DRAM, we see that upticking in the December quarter. There's some moving parts there, but that's what's happening as it relates to the recent export controls. I would say the impact on the December quarter is fairly immaterial to the company overall in that we were able to move slots around. We've got certain products where customers get in the queue and so we can pull business forward.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nIt's a lot different customers, but obviously over the long term that's lost business. As we said in the prepared remarks, we think that's about $300 to $350 million between now and the end of 2026. Hopefully that gives you a little color on the moving parts.\n\n**Saurabh Arya** (Analyst)\nThank you, Bren.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Mees with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess was hoping to focus on gross margins. You guided down 50 bps. I'm assuming that's just product mix. Would love to hear your thoughts there. Then Bren, you're highlighting again the 40 to 50% incremental operating margins. If we are in a world where WFE continues to grow kind of in a double digit world over the next couple years, should we be thinking that you're at the higher end of that range given greater contributions from higher margin of silicon? Thanks so much.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, CJ, on the guide down, you're right. It's about 50 bps and it's mostly related to just mix adjustments in the quarter as I've said over the last couple of quarters. There is a tariff impact that we're dealing with which is more or less consistent.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nQuarter to quarter, that's roughly 50 to 100 basis points of impact. We're guiding 62 and output's relatively consistent. It's really a mix issue in terms of how we were thinking about running the company. Over the long run, certainly our 40 to 50% long standing incremental operating margin target does drive how we size the company. Gross margin obviously is a factor in that. We have to think about where gross margins are trending as we consider that we outperformed that target pretty significantly as revenue has grown in the mid teens, I call it above trendline growth in 2025. As we move forward, I think the easiest way to think about that is if you're more or less at trendline, we're more or less in the middle of target range and if growth levels are above that high single digit trendline, we could outperform it.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nGrowth levels below, we'll probably underperform the target a bit. That's how we're going to size the company over time. Our performance over longer periods of time is obviously very consistent with that.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nThanks so much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll move next to Joe Quaterchi with Wells Fargo.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the qualification or quantification on the advanced packaging. WFE was curious just to think about just the, the advanced packaging process control intensity. I think just based on some of the things you put out there or talked about in the past, it's like high teens. Is that the right way to think about it? How do you think about where that goes over time?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nNo, I wouldn't say it's that high. I think if you look at KLA share of WFE, one of the interesting things, as I said in the prepared remarks, is it wasn't much of a factor for us in our business. You don't have to go back more than just a few years. The percent for KLA was in the 1% range.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nNow if you take our views on 2025 at $11 billion or so, we're approaching 6%. We've seen an escalation here in terms of intensity as the requirements have changed fundamentally related to the high performance computing on the logic side and the memory side. We think that that continues over time. I don't think you're going to see that kind of slope of growth. We do expect that as densities shrink and processes become more complex, it does play to the need for more advanced systems. Of course, we have our front end portfolio that we can use to address this interesting market. I think it's a new SAM for KLA. We have a lot of great drivers within WFE that we think are driving process control and KLA share of the market.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations)\nWe're augmenting that growth with this growth that we expect to see in advanced packaging that likely over time grows modestly faster than WFE. It's a really encouraging opportunity and I think as we start to move up the value chain in terms of new capability required, I think it creates an opportunity for us to drive something in the neighborhood or better than general corporate averages on margins. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Analyst)\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. Nice results. I wanted to ask a bigger one that people have been trying through the earnings period here. I understand it wasn't in the preamble, but Lam went out and talked about $100 billion of AI spend is roughly equivalent to $8 billion in WFE or additional spend. They talked about most of that being related to memory. Do you agree with that statement or do you have any qualification for how you would look at that ratio?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nI think in general, Rick, I think in general if you think about what goes into a data center, the % that is memory, the % that is GPUs or logic and then the rest, you're probably at about, if you take $100 billion, then you could say that half of that would be semiconductor related.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThe intensity on that kind of gets you to that run rate, but I don't think it's necessarily 50/50 in terms of memory and in terms of the logic side. Our view is you're pretty close. As we were just talking, added packaging, so we get closer to $10 billion on $100 billion because of the investment. It's not just semiconductor but packaging. We think our opportunity in that is pretty good because again those are all the high challenging process control elements, kind of everything that we've been talking about. Larger die, more valuable die where HBM is really challenging from a process control, getting more so, and then packaging. We're in general agreement. We would add back in the packaging part and we think our participation in there is above our average intensity for the rest of the industry. Super helpful.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Timothy Oncari with UBS.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nThanks, Bren. Rick was talking about customers starting to want to get in line for, so I would imagine bookings were pretty good. Can you give us, can you give us RPO? I know it was $7.9 billion last quarter. Where did it end this quarter?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nHey Tim, we changed our disclosures, so we're not disclosing that anymore. What I will tell you is that if you look at our lead times, our expectations for our lead times, as I said last quarter, they've been converging after a couple of years of elevated backlog related to a number of greenfield projects that have now shipped through. If you look at the composition of our business going forward, really tied to some of our longstanding customers that tend to operate in six-month kind of lead time windows, our lead times have converged and I think normalized between seven and nine months.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nIf you go back and look at 2020, 2021, even go back historically for KLA, it used to be about six months. Our customer base is broader today, and I think there's a combination of a little bit more new fab activity that will push those up. The context that we provided in terms of our expectations for growth next year and how that plays through in terms of KLA's first half and second half is supported by an order flow that is consistent with those lead times. I think that is how you should think about it. In the 10-K each year, as we have historically, we will provide our backlog. That will give you an anchor point in terms of backlog on an ongoing basis. Seven to nine months, and it looks pretty consistent in that range as we go forward.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nI guess you did give it the last quarter, Bren. Is that new this quarter?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, we changed our disclosure, Tim, and we highlighted that we were going to make that change back in the March quarter results. We said when we started the new fiscal year beginning July 1 that disclosure would change. There are a number of reasons for that. The primary reason being the inconsistency in how that disclosure was being interpreted and reported across our industry. We have aligned more closely with the disclosure that our peers have, and that's what we're going to do here going forward.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nOkay, then I guess it's my second question. You said last quarter, Bren, that China was going to be for you down 10% to 15% this year. Even to get down 10%, I have to have China down like $250 million Q1Q in December.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nIs that the right number that China is going to be back to like 30, 31% in December?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah, in the December quarter I think China will be high, high 20s. Yeah, you're in the range. We'll see how the quarter finishes up. I think in the high 20s is how I'm modeling it and then it translates into, you know, maybe it's 30, maybe it's 31. Very consistent with the way I talked about it all year long.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nOkay, Brent, thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nYeah. The other thing I'd say is, as you look at 2026, we think it probably comes down into the mid-20s and obviously some of that is driven by the export restrictions, but also some general normalization that we've been talking about that would be coming. We think it likely settles somewhere in the mid-20s as we look at 2026, at least how we see it today.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nWe'll take our next question from Chris St. Mark with TDK.\n\n**Operator**\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. I had a two-part question. One is, in the past you've spoken about 2 nanometer gate all around as a 100 basis point improvement in share for you. What's a 3A? Is that still the case? And number two is, I think if I remember right, their advanced packaging share is about 50%. If I do the math on that, it's $11 billion and $9.5 million. It seems like advanced packaging WFE intensity is around mid-teens. Do you think advanced back end inspection process control is getting higher than front end or do you think it's still below?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI think it's still below. I mean, since the first part of your question we haven't looked into has been a more intensive process control intensive node. Obviously, you have an architecture change that's quite significant.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThe other issue is that as you think about larger die, that creates opportunities for more process control intensity. I think the lithoscaling and litho layers with larger die designs or HPC designs tends to drive more litho layers in the process as well. When we look at N2 overall versus N3, we do see an improvement in overall intensity. There's a share element to it too. We're encouraged by some of the share movement we're seeing, but overall that's how we see it as it relates to advanced packaging. I think our logic share is higher than our memory share. We'll have more to say in terms of articulating how this market breaks up. As I look at KLA share, the advanced packaging market, we're about 6%. If you look at KLA's share of the PC market, it's closer to 8%. The process control intensity is not as high.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nSampling rates are pretty elevated these days and we'll see over time if that changes. Certainly, the need for more capability will be a requirement here moving forward, but we'll see how those things trade off over time as our customers move forward.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nGotcha. I think you also mentioned that some of your front end tools are being used for backend. I'm just kind of curious, especially on the macro inspection or inspection side, is there an overkill? Even ASML scoped about introducing new I line tool for advanced packaging. Would you consider introducing new tools for back end packaging or are you going to use the punk and tool?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you, no. It's funny you say that because that was our initial reaction when the customers wanted us to put our front end portfolio in the back end. We said, are you sure?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nBecause the cost of that, are you sure you need it? They were quite certain that they needed it because of the—just think about the cost of yield failure in packaging and how much it's worth to ensure that that's not happening. That's what we've really seen in terms of that. It's obviously not our most advanced tools, but they are systems that we use in the front end and that would have been considered the most advanced tools if you go back a few years. Absolutely, they're the ones that pulled us in. We did not come to them; it was almost the other way. They said, we want you to provide this capability.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWhen we think about the roadmap for packaging—and remember what we're talking about, advanced packaging—in many ways, early innings, because there are still other technology inflections that are going to go into HBM over the next several years as the rest of the market catches up with these advanced packages. We're really talking about a pretty small percentage of available packages being inspected at this high level. Over time, people will learn more about it and they won't inspect at the frequency. That's why we see the growth will continue, but it won't continue at the rate we've had for the last couple of years. It should outpace overall WFE growth. Our share position is great for two reasons.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nOne is that we've got this capability, but beyond that, unlike our competitors that are coming from the back end, we have roadmaps and a lot of customers have tremendous value in that roadmap ability.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you very much, very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Research Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. I noticed that based on your Q4 guidance, the KLA profile control revenue in DRAM is probably going to grow 50% ish year on year. I don't think the overall DRAM WFE is growing that much. I think historically people don't really think of KLA as a DRAM house, more of a leading edge logic house. I wonder what's happening this year. Why is it growing this much faster than DRAM WFE specifically, is it kind of tied to the EUV insertion in DRAM and how do we think about 2026 DRAM outside of the process control growth?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you. Yeah, it's an interesting observation. For those of us that have been around for a long time, we remember when DRAM was actually leading technologically and was the biggest market for inspection for KLA.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWhat happened was for many years there was a bit of a holiday in terms of design rules in DRAM and the need for process control and what the use case was. When you get into what's going on, especially around the high-bandwidth memory and the challenges that people have relative to the new design rules, we're actually seeing in some cases higher sensitivity requirements for DRAM on some layers than we're even seeing in logic. We've had a bit of a reversal in some areas and we've seen big adoption early on as people are debugging these processes and then realizing they don't have a lot of process margin. That's the other thing that is there, and when they start EUV then they're using our systems for print check. You see a lot of applications happening and that's really what's been driving this increase.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWe thought it would happen years ago, we were hoping it would happen sooner, but it's definitely happening. We're seeing leadership in some areas in terms of the need for process control as they retool these DRAM facilities to deal with some of the new market requirements. The introduction of EUV was certainly a factor in terms of process control intensity. We think overall it probably changed it about a point. If you look at the requirements for HBM, we think it's increased to another point or so. Rick talked about a lot of the issues. The other thing you have to keep in mind is that the reliability requirements in a stack of DRAM chips in an HBM device, the device is only as good as the weakest DRAM.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThe performance requirements, the process variability that the customer can accept, you can't bin these devices that go into an HBM integration. There are a number of things that are happening there that are positive for process control intensity.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Research Analyst)\nGot it. Maybe a quick follow-up. I think going back a couple of years ago, you guys talk about delayed pellicle-ization, what that means to the KLA mask inspection portfolio. I thought the thesis was that without pellicle your existing mask inspection plus screen check probably works the best, but with the pellicle maybe actinic works better. I know this has been an ongoing discussion for many years, but we are hearing some recent reporting out of Taiwan talking about your leading foundry customer potentially converting a fab into a pellicle fab. I wonder what that means to your overall strategy on mask inspection. Maybe you shed some light on that.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Research Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah, so rather than go into specific strategies specific customers have, I can tell you we're in conversations with all the leading mask manufacturers in the fabs in terms of what is their strategy relative to reticle qualification and requalification. It's a critical area and although we don't have all the pieces in that, we have many of the pieces because there's many points along the way, whether you're calling the reticles in the fab, you're doing recall, or you're doing verification and print check. We're heavily involved in those conversations. As you know, the challenges with pellicle utilization and the trade-off is throughput. That's always the issue of using pellicles as you give up some of the light performance. There have been advancements and we're well positioned to support those.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nWhen we talk about a record year in our reticle business, obviously people are buying with the future in mind as they do that and we continue to see growth going forward. We feel pretty good about our ability to participate as we go forward in terms of any scenario that plays out. I can tell you we're very heavily involved in customers with those conversations.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Research Analyst)\nThanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nThank you. Good evening. I guess the first question is regarding the commentary on 26. Could you give a little more detail about what you're seeing, first half versus second half? I assume that it's a combination of advanced logic and DRAM driving that second half, and is that just simply a function of where your lead times are, that some of the improvements we've seen over the past couple of months are just now flowing through in orders given where the lead times are right now?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah, as you said in the prepared remarks, I think the first half is maybe flat to slightly up, and we'll see as we move forward where that ends up. At least that's how it looks today. I think you'll see growth accelerate more into the second half.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nLead time discussions, we're talking about slots, but I think there are some facility dynamics also that are influencing some of the timing. I would expect advanced logic and the broadening of the investment that I mentioned to be a driver into the first half. There's continued momentum on the DRAM front too. We're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing there, obviously offset by some weaker numbers out of China, but the leading edge dynamics are encouraging.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nThank you. Just a question on gross margins as we go into 26 also and with some of the mix changes, particularly with China probably coming down as a percentage of the mix. Anything we should think about with respect to gross margins as we start modeling through 26?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah, Chris, I'll give a little bit more specific guidance on margins and operating expense expectations based on our revenue picture next quarter.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nGross margins for KLA are generally impacted, almost exclusively impacted by what we sell, not so much who we sell to and where we sell it. It really is a factor of how it's impacting certain product types. We have a pretty extensive portfolio of products, the broadest in our segment of the industry, and depending on what you're buying, it can carry different margin profiles. Certain parts of the market, like packaging, tend to carry a more diluted stream, as I mentioned earlier. I think over time that goes from being a headwind, and retail and service tends to grow and has a more dilutive gross margin, but we believe in accretive operating margin. You do have some of the moving parts. The tariff impact, when you compare year to year, we really. That's more second half dynamic this year.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nMy hope is, given some of the things that we have going on in the company in terms of assessing how we can try to mitigate that exposure, that that becomes less of a headwind over time. I think structurally we're in a world where we'll be dealing with higher, low, higher tariffs. I do think there are things we do in terms of how we operate the company where there's some ROI in terms of just how we move parts around the world and how we reduce the leakage and drawback scenarios as we understand and track different parts attributes that help reduce some of that. I think there are a number of dynamics at play that will become less of a headwind over time and, depending on the growth of the business, obviously that will have a volume will have an impact too.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nI'll have more to say about it. I think those are some of the context behind the different moving parts.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nHelpful. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Shane Britt, Morgan Stanley.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Analyst)\nThank you for letting me ask a question. I wanted to follow up on Charles's earlier question, but your memory customers have been talking up CapEx growth into 2026. Just given how strong this December quarter DRAM guide is, how should I think about your memory growth expectations into next year relative to this really strong December quarter?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThank you. Yeah, I apologize. I know that Charles asked that and we didn't answer that question. There are definitely some timing factors that are influencing your process control timing relative to other products. As I look at where we're at, this year's been a very strong year in DRAM for the company. I would expect next year to be a growth year as well.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI think a lot of the announcements, as we start to see that play out, we'll see whether that is more of a second half dynamic into next year and how much that sort of carries forward. What is clear is across all of our customers, I expect them to spend more and to see growth in our DRAM investment from our customers into next year.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. As a quick reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, you may press Star One. Now we'll take our next question from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.\n\n**Edward Yang** (Analyst)\nHi Rick, Bren, thanks for the time. Most of my question's been already answered, but maybe you could talk about your outlook for foundry related revenue opportunities outside the dominant Taiwanese customer. I think at least one major foundry has historically underinvested in yield improvement tools. Maybe that tune is changing. Are you seeing any change in engagement there?\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations)\nYeah, I would say that, you know, we're encouraged by, as we said earlier, we're encouraged by the broadening of investment that we're seeing at the leading edge as we go into next year. The conversations, qualitatively, the conversations we have with customers that are looking to, as you mentioned, not the leader that are looking to do advanced logic, we do have a lot of conversations around what they're asking our advice, what do they need to be successful, especially since they maybe haven't been pressing the latest nodes.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThere's a lot of conversation we have about the specific things they're trying to accomplish. It depends on the dynamics, it depends on their mix, it depends on their die size, it depends on what their expectations are for how fast they want to ramp. It is for sure a lot of conversations we're having. As Bren says, we feel pretty good about those discussions. I think for a lot of people, the process control part, they haven't really fully understood how the world has changed in the last few nodes. Those conversations are ongoing. Just as a quick follow up, yesterday the leading AI accelerator company talked about a half trillion dollar backlog. We're seeing these flurry of deals involving the major AI lab players.\n\n**Edward Yang** (Analyst)\nFrom your vantage point, can you level set for us, is the semiconductor industry positioned to serve that scale of demand or is the ecosystem discounting some of these projections as aspirational? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nYeah, I don't, I guess I would maybe cast it a little bit differently in the sense that I think the semiconductor industry is being prudent in terms of adding capacity. Right now when we talk to, when we try to reconcile the external discussions about CapEx and would that translate into in terms of wafers, not enough wafers will be available to achieve those objectives in the time frame. Our view is that not necessarily a bad thing. It means it's not going to. It's unlikely to overheat if those forecasts remain intact. There are more gating factors than there are people making announcements.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nIt's easier to make an announcement about investment in a data center than it is to build a new fabric. I think it's going to take some time for the industry to absorb and support the capacity demands implied by all the public announcements.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Blaine Curtis. Jeffrey.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Analyst)\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to go back to the DRAM comments you talked about, the increasing capital intensity. I'm just kind of curious about the conversations. Obviously, massive numbers have been thrown out there. Just kind of curious. I think someone asked this prior about was that always the plan to have DRAM up this much or have things been pulled in? If you could elaborate a little bit more color on those conversations. You said where they're looking for capacity, like what's holding it up? Is it just they need fab space or are they unsure about the demand? Same color there would be great.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nI would say that you definitely feel there's more urgency on the DRAM front in terms of timing. We'll see how that plays out in terms of slots as we move into next year.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nGiven our lead times, what we can accommodate. Obviously, we try to work closely with our customers on that front, but there's certainly, I think from a pricing point of view, the dynamics that are driving HBM pricing overall, there's definitely a sense of urgency from our customer base. As I said earlier, across the top three, I do expect higher investment levels next year than we're seeing here in 2025. The other way to think about it, if you think that there's three components, primary components that go into supporting these AI infrastructure build outs. You have obviously the GPUs and the accelerators around those. You have the packaging and then you have the memory. I think you're going to see over time that you go in phases of which one seems to be short supply. We kind of went through a phase of that with packaging being behind.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nNow I think the realization by a lot of our customers is there might be more opportunity in memory than they thought. Those are accelerated from what they even told us a few months ago. I think that that's part of what you're seeing. I think everybody is a bit amazed by the number of applications that are being realized using AI. Even inside of KLA, we keep coming up with new ways to leverage the technology and I don't think we're the only ones doing that. I think the memory guys are right now feeling, wow, there's more opportunity if they could add capacity. Those are kind of the conversations because they realize that it takes longer, as I said, to ramp the supply chain than it does to make these announcements about CapEx.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one follow up relative to the earlier question about the diversification in your leading edge logic and foundry customer base. Is that something that's more on the inquiry level at this point or are you actually seeing that either in your order book or informal forecast from those customers at this stage?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI would say we are seeing it and it certainly, as it informs our views of next year, we're seeing it in the order forecast. As Rick talked about earlier, I think there's a lot of collaborative discussion about how we can help navigate and ramp and drive time to results in this capacity. Thank you.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Analyst)\nMaybe just as a quick follow up, maybe you can help us refresh your expectations about kind of confirming mid-teens is the right level for service growth in 2025 and maybe give us a sense about whether that could accelerate next year.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nThank you. Yeah, you know, we've seen service actually pick up a little bit here. It's been a little stronger than we expected. Obviously, we've had some FX benefits, but we've also had some strengthening as utilization rates have gone up. We've seen some strength in some of our billable business. I think our service growth will be in our target range of 12% to 14% this year. I would expect right now that I look at next year that will be in the same range as well.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI think we feel pretty good about where that is, both based on the growth expected in the install base, the lifetime increase in tools, the incremental value that's coming from the complexity in the systems and how that's affecting the pricing as it relates to contracts, the opportunities in the acquired businesses that we've acquired over the last few years to drive their service business, and new requirements that we're seeing. This is a factor in 2025 as well. As you think about packaging, a different service model for packaging but also for DRAM, where the utilization rates, to some of the earlier questions, have been higher and higher expectations of performance of our system.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nI think there's some new opportunities for growth there that, frankly, if you go back a couple years, I don't think we fully anticipated, both on the packaging front but also on high-bandwidth memory front supporting HPC.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Tim Schultz Melander with Rothschild and go.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Analyst)\nYeah, hi, thanks for taking my questions. Actually, I just had one. With respect to your outlook for next year, you talk about this broadening in demand for 2026. Could I just ask, could you just paint some color around to what extent that already bakes in high NA engagements or whether that would be an upside to your outlook for 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (CFO)\nOne thing, look, on the R&D front there's a lot of collaboration with customers. How that translates into revenue is not part of the outlook. Most of what the engagement is is on ramping. The continuation of the N2 ramp or 2 nanometer ramp across our customer base isn't influenced by the adoption of high NA in that time frame. That's great. Thank you. Certainly not in a material way.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We do have time for one additional question. We'll take our final question from Brian Lorig with SVB Leerink.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Analyst)\nThanks, I appreciate that. Maybe a question here. I think there was a reference earlier about the potential for some acceleration second half of next calendar year. I'm sure it's not one single thing, but how much of that second half outlook is tied to new clean room space availability? Knowing that some of your tools, probably some of the first that go into a greenfield path.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThere are some issues, I think, with space constraints potentially. It's not, of course, on every customer, but I do think that it could affect some timing as we move into the second half of next year and into 2027 as you start to think about the next node ramping and some of the new fabs coming online in memory. Right now, I don't think space is going to be an issue. Obviously, that would depend on the strength of demand.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThat could change, but for now it's certainly a factor, but I don't think it's a big factor as it stands today. We'll see how things go. Thanks. Maybe if I had time for a quick follow-up just on advanced packaging. I think today a lot of your inspection business strength has been strongly tied to logic. How much of your continued optimism on market and KLA growth and packaging next year involves expansion opportunities in HBM packaging? I feel good about market share both in logic and in memory on the packaging front. We've seen positive trends in both segments over the last couple years, and I think that that continues into next year.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Analyst)\nGood. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (CEO)\nThank you, Brian. And thank you everybody for your interest in KLA. We appreciate your time today and we'll be in touch.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations)\nTurn it back over to the operator for any closing instructions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This does conclude today's KLA Corporation September quarter 2025 post earnings call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGood afternoon, everyone. My name is Bo, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP - IR)\nWelcome to the June 2025 quarterly earnings call. I am joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace and our CFO, Brent Higgins. We will discuss today's results as well as our September outlook released after the market close and available on our website along with supplemental materials. We are presenting today's discussion and metrics on a non GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. All full year references may refer to calendar years.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP - IR)\nThe earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP results. PLA's IR website also contains future events, presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward looking statements.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP - IR)\nRick will start with introductory comments on the business environment and our quarter, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Now over to Rick.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThanks, Kevin. I'm going to cover business highlights for the June, commentary on KLA's relevance in the AI infrastructure build out. For the June, KLA's results were strong across the board and we were at or above the high end of our guidance ranges. Specifically, revenue was $3,175,000,000 non GAAP diluted EPS was $9.38 and GAAP diluted EPS was $9.06 We also had record free cash flow of over $1,000,000,000 for the quarter. Haley's leadership and process control has put the company in a unique position at the center of enabling success for our customers to build out infrastructure to support artificial intelligence.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nPrioritized investment to ramp AI capabilities has fueled growth at the leading edge across the semiconductor industry through more complex designs, faster product cycles, higher value wafers and increased demand for advanced packaging. In DRAM, investments in AI have been focused on high bandwidth memory, which demands higher performance, enhanced reliability, reduced redundancy and more sophisticated logic circuitry at base die chips that control the HBM stack. Demand for leading edge logic, HBM and advanced packaging capabilities were the key contributors to KLA's performance in the June. The importance of process control continues to increase due to semiconductor scaling, new architectures and materials and increasing designs. In particular, process control can improve time to results by debugging process integration challenges in the fab ramp phase and optimizing yield across a high volume manufacturing environment with high semiconductor device design mix.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nAdditionally, the evolution and complexity of requirements for advanced packaging is creating new opportunities for the value of KLA's process control and process solutions. Finally, this leads to increased relevance for KLA's service business as KLA systems become more technically complex, are utilized for longer periods where they're expecting optimal tool performance and availability. To deliver solutions to meet this demand, the company leverages the KLA operating model to focus on prioritizing and productizing new innovation in our product roadmaps and ensuring that our business operations can scale and execute to capitalize on strong growth and expanded market share in the most critical markets for our customers. To date, we've seen no material changes in customer demands or on announced investment plans. As a result, our WFE assessment for 2025 is consistent with our expectations that were stated last quarter.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThere are more details about this quarter's highlights in our shareholder letter, letter, but in short, KLA grew revenue 24% year over year in the June with sustained strong investment in leading edge foundry and logic and HPM. This quarter also marked another period of strong momentum for Advanced Packaging portfolio. We now expect Advanced Packaging Systems related revenue to exceed $925,000,000 in calendar twenty twenty five, up from our previous estimate of $850,000,000 last quarter and over $500,000,000 last year. In Services, our business grew to $7.00 $3,000,000 in the June, up 5% sequentially and 14% year over year. Finally, the June was strong from a cash flow and capital returns perspective.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nQuarter over week free cash flow topped $1,000,000,000 for the first time, ending at $1,065,000,000 For the last twelve months, cash flow was $3,750,000,000 with a free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. Total capital return in the June was $680,000,000 comprised of $426,000,000 in share repurchases and $254,000,000 in dividends. Total capital return over the past twelve months was $3,050,000,000 KLA's June results reaffirm our leadership in process control and the strength of our broad and differentiated portfolio. They also demonstrate the essential role KLA's products and services play in supporting semiconductor industry growth. Our consistent execution reflects the resilience of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our disciplined capital allocation to invest in our business over the long run and maximize long term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brett.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThanks, Rick. Daly's June results were strong. Revenue was $3,175,000,000 above the guidance midpoint of 3,075,000,000.000 Non GAAP diluted EPS was $9.38 above its guidance range.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nGAAP diluted EPS was $9.06 which was at the upper end of the guidance range. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $9 Gross margin was 63.2%, slightly above the midpoint of guidance as the quarter played out mostly as expected. Operating expenses were $6.00 $3,000,000 about $8,000,000 above the guidance midpoint. Operating expenses were comprised of $353,000,000 in R and D and $250,000,000 in SG and A. Operating margin was 44.2%.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOther income and expense net was a $23,000,000 expense with upside from guidance provided by a favorable mark to market adjustment of the strategic supplier investment. The quarterly effective tax rate was 9.9%, well below guidance as various discrete items impacted the quarter's result. Net income was $1,240,000,000 GAAP net income was $1,200,000,000 cash flow from operations was 1,160,000,000 and free cash flow was $1,060,000,000 The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended with $4,500,000,000 in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and debt of 5,900,000,000.0 The company has a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. The cornerstone of KLA's business is consistent strong free cash flow generation driven by one of the best operating models in the industry and a predictable and highly differentiated service business.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThis helps drive a comprehensive capital return strategy and includes consistent dividend growth and increasing share repurchases over the long term. Our recent actions emphasize our commitment to capital returns and our confidence in the long term shareholder value accretion of KLA. On 04/30/2025, we announced the sixteenth consecutive annual dividend increase, which was up 12% to $1.9 per share per quarter or an annualized dividend of $7.6 per share. Along with this action, we also announced a new $5,000,000,000 share repurchase authorization. I'll now turn to the outlook. It remains driven by increasing investment in leading edge logic, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. For WFE in 2025, as stated earlier, we are maintaining our original outlook for mid single digit growth in WFE from approximately $100,000,000,000 in 2024. This growth is expected to be driven principally by increasing investment in both leading edge foundry logic and memory to support growing AI and premium mobile demand, partially offset by lower overall demand from China.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nGiven KLA's strong business momentum, expanding market share opportunities, the higher process control intensity at the leading edge across all segments, We remain confident in our ability to outperform the overall WFE market in 2025. Finally, early customer discussions are constructive on expectations for calendar year 2026 to be a growth year for the industry. ALE's unique product portfolio differentiation and value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, accelerating process node capacity ramps and ensuring yield entitlement and high volume production. We continue to be encouraged that our customer discussions on product roadmaps and capacity planning have remained consistent. In this industry environment, KLA will stay focused on supporting customers, executing product roadmaps and driving productivity across the enterprise.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nALA September guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $3,150,000,000 plus or minus $150,000,000 Our quarterly revenue expectation and general stability for the remainder of the calendar year remains consistent with that articulated over the past quarters. Foundry logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 75% and memory is expected to be approximately 25% of semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 79% and NAND the remaining 21%. As always, these business mix approximations are for our semiconductor customers only and do not completely represent our aggregate process control systems revenue.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nGross margin is forecasted to be 62% plus or minus one percentage point, reflecting a slightly weaker systems revenue expectation and a 50 to 100 basis point impact from announced global tariffs. This tariff impact estimate is below our original estimate of roughly 100 basis point headwind to gross margin that we discussed last quarter. This environment is new to our industry and the long term tariff situation remains unclear. We continue to assess the impact across our business and identify potential mitigation actions to reduce our exposure to this headwind over time. We will provide periodic updates on our assessment when appropriate.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nFor calendar twenty twenty five, based on the results for the June, guidance for the September and our expectations for the business mix across systems and services, including the systems product mix, tariffs and factory utilization. We expect gross margins for calendar twenty twenty five to remain approximately 62.5%. Operating expenses are forecasted to be approximately $615,000,000 in the September. As we continue to make product development and infrastructure investments to support expected revenue growth. Given our expectations for company growth and product development roadmap requirements, we will maintain our operating expense trajectory.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOur business model is designed to deliver 40% to 50% incremental non GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over the long run. Other model assumptions include other income and expense net of approximately a $33,000,000 expense. The non GAAP effective tax rate assumption for the September and the remainder of the calendar year is 13.5% lower than the 14% we had previously estimated based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of income. For the September, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $8.28 plus or minus $0.77 and non GAAP diluted EPS of $8.53 plus or minus $77 EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 132,400,000.0 shares. In conclusion, our near term revenue guidance remains stable indicating the continuation of current business levels and our customer discussions support this outlook.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nBased on conversations with customers, we anticipate continued solid growth in calendar twenty twenty five. Given the revenue commentary for the remainder of the calendar year, we expect to meaningfully outperform the mid single digit WFE growth rate. ALA focuses on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customer technology roadmap requirements, which are driving our longer term relevance and growth expectations. ALA's business is well positioned for the current technology inflection. While we cannot ignore the near term geopolitical trends, we are encouraged by the customer engagement that informs our business forecast.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThe long term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE and advanced packaging are compelling and represent a relative performance opportunity for KLA over the next several years. That concludes our prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q and A.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Bren. Bo, if you could please queue folks for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll go first this afternoon to C. J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. J.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. So I just would love to hit on your comment around early customer discussions constructed for growth in 2026. You work typically from eight plus month lead times. Obviously, you've got some visibility into '26. So we'd love to hear kind of how those conversations are going and what needs to happen to have firm conviction on growth in '26?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nD. J. Hey, thanks for the question. And I think it's a little bit early for us to quantify it, but certainly we're encouraged by the discussions we're seeing. We think that as you look just across the industry based on those discussions that we'll see customers investing more.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nObviously, what's driving the space today is high performance compute and so that part of the market is strong. And we'll have to see how other end markets play out in terms of what that growth looks like. But certainly at the leading edge, we're encouraged by the activity we're seeing supported by that market. We're optimistic that we might see some broadening of investment there. DRAM continues to be strong fueled by HBM.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nFlash is coming off of low levels, but I think the flash market continues to be constructive moving forward. Overall, legacy seems like it's bottomed. So I think we feel pretty good where that is. We'll see what growth looks like, but at least in terms of where it's at now, don't think it's getting worse. And then our modeling as it relates to native China activity is that it's likely somewhere in that we'll see how far down, but I think it's down after a couple of years of pretty elevated investment in 2023 and 2024.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo if you think that 2025 is down and we think 2026 is probably has some headwinds as well as that normalizes given most of the focus there is on legacy.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nJust to add, as we see the continued investment in the advanced logic, as Bren mentioned, we see momentum as more and more players are bringing their design.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo you think about the sustained investment in advanced logic and then even some investment going back a node. So we're also seeing some additional so we feel really good about logicfoundry in terms of that overall momentum plus the packaging momentum we've talked about.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. I guess on the domestic China front, talked earlier indication of lower again in 'twenty six. Curious, as three regions, Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing are competing for supremacy and we've now gone from four to six large kind of players, How does that kind of inform your view? Does it give you a sense that things would only decline a little or a lot or just too early to tell? Thanks so much.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYes. I think it's too early to tell at this point. As I said, we had two years of a lot of backlog we had to shift through and work off, which we have done.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nAnd I think now that we're seeing investment from our other customers. We're seeing that drive our business outlook more strongly here moving forward. So we'll have to see as we move forward here. But my sense just in terms of looking at it bottoms up and trying to reconcile with some of the top down kind of market outlook information, I feel like it's probably got some headwinds to it in terms of the investment levels relative to '25.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll go next now to Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (ED - Equity Research)\nGood afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution guys. Year to date, so March and June, your process control systems business, right, that's inspection and patterning. That's up 35% year over year. So it looks like you guys are setting up for another strong year of growth and maybe even more share gains. Right?\n\n**Harlan Sur** (ED - Equity Research)\nBut within that, inspection is up 50% year to date, while patterning is kind of flattish, kind of similar to the profile of calendar 2024 where inspection drove most of the growth. So maybe you can just help us understand, a, the drivers of the massive strength in inspection? Is it broad based across optical, field, fair wafer, e beam? And then maybe help us understand the relatively flattish growth in patterning. And do you guys anticipate another year of total share gains in process control?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes. Harlan, thanks for the comments. A lot there. I'll try to unpack it a bit. I mean, certainly we've seen strong inflection in our optical pattern inspection business.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWe were supply constrained in that business for some time. Now we have more supply and so we're shipping through a lot of backlog for that product and that product is well positioned and really critical for gate all around. So that's been a nice driver. Obviously, happened in Packaging has also been a nice driver for this part of the business. Sampling rates and Inspection given the challenges are very, very high.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so that's been a nice tailwind for that part of the business as well. So Inspection has definitely been inflecting. As it relates to patterning, you have really three businesses that are in patterning. You have optical metrology, which is around overlay and then you also have film measurement, reticle inspection. And with overlay, as we've seen some slowdown in advanced litho from a customer point of view, there's an attach rate of that business to litho.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo that's reduced, I'd call it more really non consumption in that business. So that's been a little bit weaker. It's really the only business we have that has an attached to litho generally. Film Measurement, I think it's a little bit lumpy. We'd expect better than market growth out of that business as we go through the year for 2025.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd for Radical Inspection, it's a lumpy business. We have some large integers in there, but would expect to see that business grow meaningfully and in a record level for calendar 2025 versus 2024. So a little bit of just what happens in the quarter, but I think from a directional point of view, I think we'll see stronger patterning as we move through the second half of the year.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYes. And Harlan to your point, I think overall we are seeing process process control intensity continue to rise for all the reasons we've talked about, the advanced designs, large die.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nAnd so initially, at least a lot of that favors inspection, and Bren talked about some of the facts and patterning. And then the radical comes around. I mean for ALA, radical in 2025 is going to be a record year. So we feel good about where we are positioned there and we have more products coming along. So we feel process control intensity convincing us to strengthen and our market position is very strong.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (ED - Equity Research)\nVery insightful. Thank you for that. And yet again, you guys left your target for advanced packaging revenues from $8.50 to now 925,000,000 for calendar twenty five. That's up, like, 80% year over year. I assume it's a combination of HDM and two and a half d and three and a half d advanced packaging.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (ED - Equity Research)\nWe know that many next generation two nanometer AI GPU XTU designs are targeted for this kind of 3.5 d packaging architecture, stack chips, more HBM stacks, just overall significantly more complex versus 2.5 d. But maybe you guys can just help us understand where are you guys seeing the incremental upside? I think this is like the third or fourth time that you revised your full year outlook for Advanced Packaging. So where are you guys seeing the incremental upside?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo Harlan, you touched on a lot of it. And I think it's a combination of it took us a little while to have the products that were requested. And so a little bit of that is adoption and then some momentum once we started getting going. And then just the ramp is it's all comes back to the build out associated with the infrastructure. And for us, that's the third leg.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWe talked about logicfoundry, advanced designs, bigger die, talked about HBM and talked about packaging. And really, it's that part of packaging. And I think as our customers see success with our portfolio, we're gaining share. So the exciting part for us is apart from WFE dynamics, which I think we do spend an awful lot of time about, this is really outside of WFE. So we're seeing growth in packaging as a sector for inspection metrology.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nAlso our process position there is good. And then we're gaining share. So you have a really nice combination. And when we talk to customers, we think we're closer to the at the beginning of this trend than at the end of it. We think this is there's a lot of growth to come.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes, Harlan, the other thing I'd say is just if you just go back just a short period of time, let's go back a few years in 2022 as a percent of Advanced Packaging, our Semi Process Control business, given the nature of the requirements was pretty low, probably about intensity. Today we're sitting somewhere around in that 5% to 6% range. So just in a few years we've seen our position change quite dramatically as requirements to Rick's point have increased. So we're pretty excited about the growth rate and opportunity there. And we think that this continues to be a growth area as we move into next year.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (ED - Equity Research)\nThanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll go next now to Vivek Arya of Bank of America.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThank you for taking my question. On the first one, the process control intensity in memory, I wanted to get your views on this. Historically, it used to be low closer to, I think, mature nodes. How is that process control intensity evolving as the industry is moving from traditional PDR DRAM to more high bandwidth memory? Is there a way to quantify what the benefits are to KLA because HVM is expected to be one of the fastest growth drivers in AI accelerators?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nSo I'm just curious to understand how your opportunity is evolving as industry migrates to HVM and then advanced versions of HVM?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYes. So I'll give you a qualitative and Bren can do the harder thing and give you more quantitative. Qualitatively, you have more advanced, bigger, more valuable buy with more challenging circuitry in the periphery and less redundancy. So and you have a tremendous pressure coming because these are in high use and therefore these die don't rest. These are unlike the duty cycle is high.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo you've got it and they're part of an expensive system. So what our customers have said is they increased and as you know there's multiple players, they've increased the inspection both in the development but also in the build out and they're finding that they need everything they can get as to Incyte. And because these are more valuable die with less redundancy, the defectivity levels in the past that might have been acceptable are not. And so not acceptable now. So they need more coverage.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThey need higher tools, plus they're introducing new technology. So everything is driving toward higher process control intensity. We've been I don't know that we've been surprised, but we've been pleased by the adoption and we think there's more demand coming as people understand the challenges. And then there are roadmap cadence that's different than the consumer cadence was. So I think from their standpoint, they're going be a lot of pressure to deliver at yield.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo that's what's happening and why this adoption is very different than memory has been in years for us. So when DRAM went to EUV, we started a pattern a couple of layers or few layers with EUV. We saw a step up in intensity. So process control intensity was somewhere around 9% to 10% of WFE back before. And then with the introduction of EUV, we saw that improve.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWe saw that improve about 100 basis points. When we moved to HBM, we think that there's another 100 basis points or so of opportunity there. We'll see how that plays out over time.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nBut as Rick said, as the requirements have changed, it's increased the value of our products and changed how customers sample and their expectations around reliability. You also have bigger die, which benefits everyone, but I think these some of these challenges that they have around the market requirements for HBM are benefiting process control uniquely.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so we're seeing that on the logic side, but we're also seeing that on the memory side as well. So right now when we look at it, we think there's probably another incremental 100 bps on top of that. So if you go back pre EUV to where we are today, it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 basis points of higher process control intensity. Our share position and momentum is in a pretty good place. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nVery helpful. And then for my follow-up on gross margins kind of near and a little more medium term. So let's say December sales are flattish, should we assume gross margins stay flattish or are there any other mix effects, etcetera, that we should keep in mind? And then kind of more medium term, what are you doing to mitigate that tariff cost pressure? Can it be mitigated?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nLike when should we assume that you have some alternatives in place to get the gross margins back to the trend line? Thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes. So the first part of your question, we talked about our views of calendar twenty five gross margin at 62.5%. So if you take Q1 and Q2 and our guidance for Q3, that will lead you to an uptick in gross margin in the fourth quarter based on our expectations now around revenue mix as of this next quarter. So that should get you there. You can do the math and figure out how to get there.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nBut as it relates to tariffs, there's a lot. I mean, first of all, as I said in the prepared remarks, it's a new thing for our industry. It hasn't been a factor in our business operations historically. So now as we face the likelihood of higher structural tariffs moving forward. There are some business processes as it relates to how we move parts around, how do we leverage free trade zones and things like that to reduce leakage of tariffs as it where you pay a tariff, but then you have an opportunity when you turn around to export where you can reclaim or claw back the tariff that you pay related to the export.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo there are a lot of those dynamics that are mitigating factors. Obviously, if it drives structural cost increase, then that's something that we'll have to deal with both in our service and system businesses over time just like we would with any other cost increase. But we think that there's some opportunities to go do some things on the process side where, look, we got a lot to do. The ROI wasn't all that compelling even though it might have been a better process.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWell, if you add in the economic costs of incremental tariffs, all of a sudden some of those issues rise up or opportunities rise up to priority scale.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo that's really how we're thinking about it. I think for The Street in terms of how you're modeling KLA, I think that the 50 to 100 basis point guidance headwind is probably the way to think about it. And then as I start to see either some stability or some changes in terms of how we're doing things that reduce that, I'll provide that update when appropriate. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll go next now to Shane Brett of Morgan Stanley.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you for letting me ask a question. Apologies for asking a bit of a near term question, but if I'm understanding this correctly, your September foundry logic revenue is likely to strengthen sequentially, your memory revenue across both DRAM and NAND will decline. I thought that the memory mix, specifically DRAM may uptick a bit more in the second half. So just talk about the big business mix here and if we could see a memory uptick in the December? Thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes. The way it's lining up, I think that we'll see DRAM stronger in the December than the September.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nGot it. It's just really about timing of revenue, revenue recognition, those dynamics, the shipments, the final product acceptance processes that we run through that drive revenue into a particular quarter. But as I look at it and you think about some of the project timing that's out there, I would expect to see an uptick into the December.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you very much. And for my follow-up, so at twenty twenty two Analyst Day, set out $14,000,000,000 revenue target for 2026, which I think was based on $125,000,000,000 WFE assumption. I think your market share gains have clearly checked above what you're probably thinking in 2022. Just could you talk about those market share gains and sort of where your kind of current assumptions are towards as we think towards 2026?\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nNot really asking for revenue guide, but if you can kind of give us a few crumbs on how to think about 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWell, you're right. The 2026 plan assumed WFE level in the mid-one hundred twenty range. And so we'll see whether we get there or not. But I would say for Kaylee, we don't need 01/2025 to make that plan. Given the strength that we've seen in our share of WFE, the growth rates we've seen in packaging, obviously we've had some headwinds as it relates to export control in terms of lost opportunity, but also how that's affected our service business.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nBut in general, we feel like we're pretty well positioned from a share of WFE point of view. We assumed a 7.25% share of WFE. If you take out Packaging, I think our share of WFE is approaching 8%, then you add in the Packaging opportunity. So we'll see. If I got WFE levels in the mid teens, I think we got a shot at it.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nBut I think when you consider puts and takes, we don't need as much given the growth rates we've seen in our overall share of market. Now that's been intensity driven. I mentioned packaging. We're also I think pretty confident around some of the share opportunities we also have. That's all that's part of that number.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThe financial model underneath is operating very consistent. Absent the tariff effect, we'd probably be in line or maybe even slightly better on the gross margin side at that revenue level. So the rest of it is driven by our incremental operating margin model and our expectation of drop through to EPS based on business performance, but also capital structure action of EPS growth of 1.5 times our revenue growth rate. So it really is going to be predicated on where WFE ends up in terms of how we perform against that target. But the financial framework is executing as we expected.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We go next now to Charles Hsu of Needham.\n\n**Charles Shi** (MD - Senior Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. Maybe my first question a little bit more about China. China as a percentage of sales 26% in March, 30% in Q2. So is the 30% still the right number kind of going into the second half of the year? Or shall we kind of expect some upside?\n\n**Charles Shi** (MD - Senior Analyst)\nBecause the data point so far has suggested that there has been some upside in China WFE so far. But kind of wonder since you still view China WFE is coming down this year kind of want to get some thoughts there. Thanks.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes, Charles, and I'll try to unpack this a little bit. If you go back to earnings in January, we talked about our China business dropping to the 30% level assuming a $3 ish billion run rate and that's down from about 41% in 2024. So obviously Q1 was lower, which means that you're likely to see higher percentages as you move forward. So our we fast forward to April and the guidance in April was very consistent with that. If you look at where we sit today, I still see it at roughly 30% plus or minus.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nNow the second half will be higher than the first half because you were 2630% Q2. So I think the second half is higher than the first half, but for the company overall, we're still in line with that 30% expectation plus or minus a couple of points. Now our business has strengthened. We were at $3,000,000,000 run rate. Now we just guided three fifteen.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo some of that strength has been reflected in China at a consistent percentage. So at the beginning of the year, we thought our China business would be down somewhere between 1520% overall. As I sit today, I think we're probably down somewhere between 1015% on just the general strengthening overall. So China behaving pretty much as expected and expected here to end up somewhere around 30%.\n\n**Charles Shi** (MD - Senior Analyst)\nThanks, Brent. I appreciate the color. Maybe another relatively higher level question. I answered your I listened to your answers to the questions from other analysts on this call regarding cost of control intensity. I think historically, people kind of associate or positively correlate process control intensity with lithography intensity.\n\n**Charles Shi** (MD - Senior Analyst)\nI think lots of discussion on lithography intensity this year feels like the consensus is probably coming down. But I think that historical correlation kind of broken down over the past couple of years. Process control intensity actually was on the way up. Lethal probably kind of coming down if we remove any of the stockpiling in China, those kind of factors. So kind of wanted to get the sense from you guys, what do you see that the process control intensity?\n\n**Charles Shi** (MD - Senior Analyst)\nWhy is that correlation breaking down? And what's the outlook going forward from here? Do you expect bifurcation is kind of going to be sustaining structural or maybe we'll get a mean reversion event at some point in the down the road? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYes, that's an insightful question. If you go back in time and I won't go too far back, but often the process control for lithography was associated with wavelength shifts in lithography usually driven by one large manufacturer of a microprocessor. And so that was the cadence that kind of set everything. And so in those cases, you'd be going to a new design rule and you'd need new lithography, maybe the mix was different with the advance. And so you'd see intensity go up and those same drivers would be driving process control intensity to your point.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWhat's changed quite a bit is the dynamics associated and it started happening a few nodes ago where we saw a proliferation in advanced designs at leading edge. Because historically what you also saw was fewer people designing at the leading edge. So therefore, was pretty correlated. But around seven nanometers, we started seeing more designs happening and the design intensity around the number of designs chasing leading edge doesn't really do anything for lithography intensity. In fact, it doesn't do anything for much capital intensity except for process control intensity because you have a higher degree of variability because you have more designs going through at the leading edge.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYou drive radical consumption up higher and that has been a very stable market. But more importantly, you have a very high mix fab where the variability is more and more challenged. And then you have to manage that in terms of how do you make sure you're yielding enough and not putting too many wafers in. That's all about process control. That's not about other things, not about litho.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nAnd then add to that, the latest thing that's accelerated even further is the number of large die and associated with AI. So you have yet another driver that's doing it. On top of all that, you have what's going on in advanced packaging, which is allowing people to integrate a lot and in many ways reduces the need for other equipment, but increases the need for process control. Lastly, you have what's going on in HBM. So it's kind of a perfect transition from a if your business is process control, this is a really good time because every one of these drivers is driving the intensity and the way that customers can afford to have more processes control as they don't need as much intensity in their other parts of semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo you're exactly right, but it's really the proliferation of designs and the drivers around AI.\n\n**Charles Shi** (MD - Senior Analyst)\nAppreciate the insights, Rick. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll go next now to Tom O'Malley with Barclays.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When you answered the question earlier in the call on 2026, and I appreciate it's early and you don't want to give more color, you talked about the broadening of leading edge trends, and I think you were very intentional around using that word. Are you talking about additional customers coming in on the leading edge side? Or you just talking about the broadening of opportunities in the existing pillars of customers that you already have?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nBoth. Talking about both. We're seeing more people at the leading edge as we've talked about higher mix foundries. And for the first time, I think in quite a while, we're seeing more players doing leading edge or very close in proximity to leading edge across. So we're seeing some momentum there.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSome of that's been in the news. And as a result, what we're seeing is a broadening of customers as well as a proliferation of design. And I think it is the proliferation of design that is driving the broadening of customers.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nAnd when you guys look out into 2016, you obviously are also thinking look at this look at the environment you just described. You talked about a lot of different areas in which process control is going to do a lot better than other areas of equipment. How are you comfortable in talking about the strength of the broader market where you're kind describing a dynamic where maybe you're taking more of the pie and obviously having more of the pie, the market may look a lot bigger. So maybe can you walk us through like what you're doing to understand what your intensity is of total WFE next year? Do you see share gains?\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nAnd maybe the market isn't as big, but you maybe have a piece of that market that's a little bit larger. How do you kind of figure that out as you look at your forecast into next year?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWell, I'll take the qualitative. Fran wants to do the quantitative part. We don't actually know exactly. What we know are what the trends are happening. And there's always been this thing about process control that kind of cuts both ways.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nOne is can you solve these problems? And if you could, you people would buy systems to do it. But for a long time, there were a lot of unmet needs. So people would find other ways to solve those problems because eventually they're going to figure it out. And what I mean by that, let's say you need to find a specific defect in a specific part of the process, you need to segment that process to find it. If you don't have the tools that are actually capable of doing that, customers will figure out another way around it, maybe not nearly as efficient. But so part of what's changed is we have more of those tools and part of what the reason we have that is our portfolio has been strengthened through a lot of investment over the years. And we talked about quite a while ago, the repeated application of advanced processing of our own systems using AI has given us more ability to solve those problems in conjunction with some new product offerings such as our e beam portfolio means that we can give customers a better way to manage those. So from the standpoint of that, but I don't actually think in some customers, they are figuring out dynamically how much process control they need, and it's still incumbent on us to prove the value when they introduce it. But when we say we're pretty confident going into 2026, it's because we have more and more places where customers are telling us, in some regards, they're playing back to us what we may have said to them a while ago, we know we need more process control intensity.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWe need you to help us get that portfolio, and they're making sure that we have the ability to do that. Those are encouraging conversations that we're having now. And we understand why because we're involved in a lot of the debugging of these processes to understand. You also have architectural changes that are just making it harder. And so the dynamics of supporting these advanced nodes and as I mentioned before, we're in kind of the perfect storm for all the process flows, whether it's HVM and those are more challenging, whether it's advanced logic with bigger die and also the packaging.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo that's why we feel pretty good about '26. And Brent can maybe add more color.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes. Look, we all know our own business is probably best. So when we try to provide some color on where the industry is, obviously, that's informed by what you know and are closest to.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo we thought that it was prudent at this point given the nature of customer conversations to provide our perspective on next year the way we did. To Rick's point, we do see opportunities for our business to continue to inflect. One thing about larger die density challenge where everybody benefits from bigger wafers. But the defect density challenges when you have large die creates new opportunities for process control. When you look at high performance compute, you also look at the value of those die.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so that given the nature of that customers are investing more to ensure that those chips function as designed and the performance specs are quite rigorous. So all that gives us a certain amount of confidence around our own business. And I tried to do my best to give you at least the perspective that I have today at the July what next year what we think next year looks like.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nThank you. Appreciate that.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We go next now to Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up to that kind of line of questioning. If we think about just you talked about the rising and diversity of designs that starts in HPC increasing KLAs relevancy. I guess, how do you think about just the sample rates or what that does to sample rates for process control?\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nDo we just think about that as being maybe the peak to trough is less steep on a new node ramping? Or is this kind of a step function higher in terms of sample rates?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYes. This is another interesting development, Joan, and I'll because we have that same question. If you go back historically, you'd have a new node, you would ramp at the beginning of time, you'd ramp it up and then you'd run it in volume. And so you'd see process control intensity most highest at the front end, right? That's what you're referring to?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYes. What's happened now What's happened now though is because there are multiple designs, what we're seeing is they'll debug the customer will debug a new process on a specific device type, a specific wafer and they'll ramp that. But not long after, you'll get other designs that are coming in that have their own version of those ramps and they're not the same. In many cases, the process flows for different customers are different. The die size might be different.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo you're really having a compounding of ramps inside what looks like HBM. And a lot of these HBM fabs are actually doing process ramps of the new nodes plus there are continued improvements inside of that node in terms of what that capability. And even to one degree, we saw somebody go back to a prior node and introduce more process control because what was introduced into that prior node was a larger die. And so it's not the traditional model people think of when you go back in time of you ramp it and then you run it. That's not what's happening.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThere's multiple ramps because every one of these die these devices come in. There's some benefit to some customers to not be first with their advanced design. In fact, there's an economic benefit to coming in six months later, but it doesn't make it easier to ramp it in the production. So that's why when we look out and we look at the distribution and we were looking for is are we seeing that effect of seeing it front end loaded? And the answer is no.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThat's not what we're seeing. In fact, in some cases, we're seeing it going back because the yield these waivers are so valuable that if there's an entitlement of yield and they can get more, they're actually putting in more process control to squeeze those lines to get more capability. So very different than the traditional view of how process control ramps with the new technology node. Joe, the other thing is that when these nodes are well adopted, say the design levels are high, then that limits what our customers are able to do in terms of trying to reuse their equipment at least as it relates to our products. And so as we've had a litho roadmap, we've had new architectures, the Moore's Law attributes have been good that drive the design environment high, then it limits the reuse of capacity.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThere's a number of technical challenges that also limit it, but certainly the adoption levels of the leading edge by multiple designs is a factor as well.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd let me add two more things. Because you have multiple reticles, reticles have always been 100%, right? You're inspecting all the reticles to make sure and then you have a recall, but you're inspecting them to make sure they're good. And why?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nBecause they're so expensive and the cost of failure is so high. We're actually seeing that dynamic in packaging too because the cost of these advanced packages are so high that they're running at 100%. So that doesn't even fall off. That's just because of the cost structure of those. So multiple situations, it's not as easy to model as it used to be, but it's good for process control intensity.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nThat's super helpful. And maybe just as\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\na follow-up, I think earlier to your question, you said and correct me if I'm wrong, but you said reticle revenue reticle inspection revenue this year would be a record or pretty strong growth. Can you help us just understand like what's driving that? I know that like China had been a source of demand for that, but I think there's also quite a bit of demand on leading edge or N minus one nodes.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nJoe.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo China is a factor there, right, because the very limited number of captive mash shops or investments to develop a merchant mask ecosystem. There is legacy node radical tools that continuing to be a factor for us. Requalification opportunities in the fab given the nature of the number of designs, the value to Rick talked about and the limited use of pellicles is also a factor. The other thing you have that's also driving it is more single die since most of the reticles, let's say, 60% plus of reticles are single die reticles, you need to inspect those reticles against a reference.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so whether that is a database reference of the design or whether that's different golden reference, then that's also a factor. We're also seeing benefit in terms of print check on the broadband plasma Gen four platform or Gen five, that one's a Gen five platform that is doing reticle qual as well. And all that business shows up in our optical inspection results and not in patterning. But there's a number of drivers and a ton of investment happening by customers to ensure that these reticles are the fidelity of the pattern is good and that they're not introducing any defectivity because you need 100% defect detection, reticle inspection before you print that defect on to every die. So a number of good drivers across multiple products.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nBut just to point out, what Bren talked about using optical for print check that is not included when we say we're having a record here in reticle. It's without that. Got it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nWe'll go next now to Timothy Arcuri of UBS.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Ben, can you I know you're going to shift how you report backlog and RPO, but I think that's maybe with the new fiscal year. So can you give us RPO?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes. So we'll report in the 10 ks.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nI think we're going to file it here in another week or so. RPO will be somewhere around in the neighborhood of $7,900,000,000 So it came down by like $1,000,000,000 It came down by about that much. Yes, we're starting to see, as we said earlier, as we shift through a lot of the long backlog customers now and some of the supply constrained products, we're now seeing our business being driven by our long standing customers that operate with shorter lead times. So now we're normalizing lead time. We've been talking about it for a number of quarters that we were moving towards it.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nI think now we're getting into that range where, look, our long standing customers have historically six to eight month lead times. The Packaging business has two to three month lead times. So we're seeing a normalization of lead time that's happening here and that's affecting the backlog level. It took a while to get here. We were up at eighteen months of backlog.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nNow we're down around eight months of backlog. You have to remember, the RPO number is significantly a systems number. So when you do the math on it, you have to compare it against the systems revenue. And so when you do that math, you end up in that seven to nine month range that I talked about.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nYes.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nI mean, we've been talking about it for a while that it's going to come down. But it was the 1,000,000,000 that was stripped out by you, so basically that's canceled by you?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nNo, no, no. That was part of our shipments. I mean, we don't really see our backlog canceled all that much.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nI mean, we had to strip out backlog as it relates to export controls when that happened. But whenever we make adjustments that are de booking adjustments, those are typically related to an event like that. Backlog tends to pull together when customer gets us an order. And you have to remember, we had a number of new customers that were doing greenfield projects that to get a slot when you want it, what do we require? We require an order.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nWe require a deposit. We require letters of credit. So that was a big part of the backlog. Now you fast forward to where we are today and you look at our long standing customers that you know well, well those customers we build the forecast with. And so the order to shipment timing tends to be in that six to eight month timeframe.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nSo we're seeing more of that business going forward and that's reflected in the lower backlog levels. I would expect it now that we normalize it to stay more or less in this range here going forward.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks, Brad. And then just on service, you were thinking up 10% for the year, but you seem to be running after that. Is that like looking this year? Can you talk about that service?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nFor the I'm sorry, Tim, Oh, you're breaking up a little service. Yes, overall service, I think we're in that ballpark. Yes, 10% plus range for the year.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nSo it's but it's still going to go up sequentially in September, December, right?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nYes.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay. Got it. Thanks.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nIt generally does, right? I think because as you add tools and tools come off of warranty, unless you have some situation where all of a sudden like you lose access to a fab and we thought that might put some pressure on sequential growth. But we've also seen the dynamics in our service business start to inflect in terms of performance requirements, availability requirements and our general attach rate. So it's the fifty second quarter of year over year growth for service and we'd expect to see sequential growth in service as we continue through the year.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question this evening. We'll take that now from Brian Chin of Stifel.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nHi there. Thanks for sneaking me in here at the end. I think one of my questions has kind of been asked here, which you remarked on pretty well, which is basically that these data center chips are kind of breathing life into minus one nodes, it sounds like. I think that's something that's a pretty important thing. Maybe one last my question will be, I could be mistaken, but I think when you've discussed in the past, it felt like your near term opportunity set in Advanced Packaging was particularly in 2.5p or co op packaging rather than in HBM.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nIs that the case? And where is more is that the case I guess? And also are you addressing more inspection applications still or is metrology part of that as well?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYes. Most of our share gains that we've seen so far have been in the logic area with co ops. Although we are seeing increased momentum in HBM. So we're pretty excited about directionally where that's going. So it certainly is informing our view of share opportunities.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nIt is more defect loaded than metrology because sampling rates for metrology are tend to be a little bit lower as the design rules that are typically used in packaging are larger. So that limits some of the metrology opportunities in the short run. But from an inspection point of view to Rick's earlier point, the sampling rates are incredibly high because you don't want to miss defects, you don't want to overkill devices either. So you don't want to underkill and miss something, you don't want to overkill either. And I think so that's driving higher sensitivity requirements from KLA.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And at this time, Mr. Kessel, I'd like to turn things back to you, sir, for any\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP - IR)\nJust thank you everybody for your time, for your interest in KLA. We appreciate it. We know it's a busy week of earnings, busy day. We'll be in touch as we go forward. Thank you. Bye bye.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President, CEO &amp; Director)\nGoodbye.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGood afternoon. My name is Margot, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants' lines have been placed in a listen only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (Vice President, Investor Relations &amp; Market Analytics)\nWelcome to our earnings call to discuss the March and our June outlook. Joining me is our CEO, Rick Wallace and our CFO, Brent Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market closed and available on our website along with supplemental materials. We are presenting today's discussion and metrics on a non GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. All full year references made refer to calendar years.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (Vice President, Investor Relations &amp; Market Analytics)\nThe earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events, presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward looking Rick will begin with some introductory comments on the business environment and the quarter, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Now over to Rick.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThanks, Kevin. I will start our March results and talk about some comments about the current business environment followed by some recent market share reports and finish up with some business highlights. KLA's March quarter results were above the midpoint of all the guidance range with revenue of $3,060,000,000 non GAAP diluted EPS of $8.41 and GAAP diluted EPS of $8.16 KLA's results continue to be fueled by strong demand in leading edge logic and high bandwidth memory. KLA's growing advanced packaging business also made another strong contribution in the quarter.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThese drivers demonstrate the critical investment required for building which is supporting AI. While there is notable macro uncertainty across many sectors globally, PLA has not seen any change in demand or indication from our customers of any adjustment to their announced investment plans. That said, the current unprecedented global trade uncertainty and potential second order effects on macro demand in the future are far from clear. Given this fluid business operating environment and potential implications for KLA, we've decided to postpone our Investor Day from June 18 to early to mid calendar twenty twenty six. It's our hope that the macro environment will stabilize by then and we look forward to expanding on the story of KLA's growth strategy and increasing market relevance.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nOur capital return announcements today reflect not only our commitment to assertive and explicit capital allocation, but also our confidence in the business opportunities for KLA over the foreseeable future. Moving along to market share reports. This quarter marks the annual release of industry research reports showing KLA maintain a strong global share of WFE and process control markets in calendar twenty twenty four. KLA's continued share leadership was highlighted by persistently strong customer adoption and share gain in advanced wafer level packaging. Over the past five years, KLA share of process control has grown by nearly two fifty basis points.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nNotably, KLA's process control share of advanced wafer level packaging market has grown from being in third position in 2019 to being on track to assume leading position in 2025. Turning to highlights for the quarter, KLA delivered a 30% year over year increase in revenue in the March due to increased investment in leading edge logic and HBM. Second, AI continues to be a key catalyst driving KLA's consistently strong performance. As AI continues to advance, the semiconductor industry is experiencing more complex design, accelerating product cycles, high value wafer volumes and growing advanced packaging demand. These trends underscore the increased value of process control and assisting our customers in managing a dynamic production environment as investments and complexity increase, which uniquely benefits KLA.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThe further demonstration of this, the March captured another period of strong momentum for our advanced packaging portfolio. Customers' adoption of KLA's advanced packaging portfolio of products demonstrate the success of our market diversification, product technology roadmap and growth strategies. KLA's advanced packaging revenue grew to over $500,000,000 in calendar twenty twenty four and is now expected to exceed $850,000,000 in calendar twenty twenty five. Fourth, the KLA services business grew to $669,000,000 in March, up modestly sequentially and up 13% year over year. Newly announced market access restrictions in early December twenty twenty four from the U.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nS. Government export controls impacted service revenue growth in the March. Still as a sign of its predictability and resiliency, our service business marked its fifty second consecutive quarter of growth on a year over year basis. Finally, the March was another solid quarter from a cash flow and capital returns perspective. Quarterly free cash flow was $990,000,000 Over the past twelve months, free cash flow was $3,500,000,000 with a free cash flow margin of 30% over the same period.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThis free cash flow margin ranks amongst the top 10% of companies in the S and P five hundred. Total capital returns in the March was $733,000,000 comprised of $5.00 $7,000,000 in share repurchases and $226,000,000 in dividends. Total capital returns over the past twelve months was $3,000,000,000 KLA's results once again demonstrated process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio and competitive differentiation. Our consistent performance further demonstrates the critical nature of KLA's products and services, which are uniquely positioned to enable growth at the leading edge, including the ongoing build out of AI infrastructure. With that, I'll pass the call over to Bren to cover financial highlights and our outlook.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThanks, Rick. KLE's March quarter results demonstrate market leadership combined with the consistent execution and dedication of our global team to meet customer commitments and driving strong results, which fueled double digit year over year growth and profitability improvement. Revenue was $3,060,000,000 above the guidance midpoint of $3,000,000,000 Non GAAP diluted EPS was $8.41 and GAAP diluted EPS was $8.16 each finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $8.55 Gross margin was 63%, about 50 basis points higher than the midpoint of guidance as product mix within our Process Control segment was stronger than modeled for the quarter. Operating expenses were $575,000,000 about $10,000,000 below the guidance midpoint as the timing of prototype material expenses were lower than expected.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nOperating expenses were comprised of $338,000,000 in R and D and two thirty seven million dollars in SG and A. Operating margin was 44.2%. Other income and expense net was a $36,000,000 expense. The quarterly effective tax rate was 15%. Net income was $1,120,000,000 GAAP net income was 1,090,000,000 Cash flow from operations was $1,100,000,000 and free cash flow was $990,000,000 The breakdown of record of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nMoving to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4,000,000,000 in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5,900,000,000 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. KLA's balance sheet provides the ability to fund our growth strategies, organic and inorganic and offer attractive capital returns to shareholders. The cornerstone of KLA's business is how consistently it generates strong free cash flow, driven by one of the best operating models in industry and a predictable and highly differentiated service business, which helps drive a capital return strategy that includes consistent dividend growth and increasing share repurchases over the long term. This strategy supports a strong track record of predictable capital deployment and remains an important differentiating element of the KLA investment thesis. To further underscore our commitment to capital returns and our confidence in the long term value accretion of KLA, today we announced the sixteenth consecutive annual dividend increase, which is up 12% to 1.9 a share per quarter or an annualized dividend of $7.6 Along with this action, we also announced a new $5,000,000,000 share repurchase authorization, raising our total repurchase authorization to $5,460,000,000 Turning to the outlook.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThe industry outlook continues to be driven by increasing investments in leading edge logic, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. For WFE in 2025, our outlook remains the same as in late January. We forecast WFE to grow by mid single digit percentage from approximately 99,000,000,000 to $100,000,000,000 level in calendar twenty twenty four. Growth is expected to be driven principally by increasing investments in both leading edge foundry and logic and memory to support growing AI and premium mobile demand, partially offset by lower overall demand from China. Given KLA's business momentum, market share opportunities and higher expected process control intensity at the leading edge across all segments, we are confident we will continue to deliver growth outperformance compared with the WFE market in 2025.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nKLA's unique product portfolio differentiation and value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, accelerating process node capacity ramps and ensuring yield entitlement and high volume production. We remain encouraged that our customer discussions have not changed and are working hard to align shipment slots with their requirements. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting our customers, executing on product roadmaps and driving productivity across the enterprise. KLA's June quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be 3,075,000,000.000 plus or minus $150,000,000 Foundry logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 69% and memory is expected to be approximately 31% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 76% of the revenue mix and NAND the remaining 24%.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nGross margin is forecasted to be 63% plus or minus one percentage point inclusive of the impact of recently announced global tariffs. This estimate is to the best of our ability given the complexity and fluidity of the regulations and how they align with our global processes. Consistent with this assessment, we expect global tariffs to have a roughly 100 basis point headwind to gross margin per quarter assuming relatively stable quarterly revenue expectations for the remainder of the calendar year. Of course, this environment is changing rapidly and we will continue our assessment and evaluate mitigation opportunities within our operational processes and pricing strategies. For calendar twenty twenty five, based on results for the March, guidance for the June and our expectations for business mix across systems and services, systems product mix and factory utilization, we expect gross margins for the year to be approximately 62.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nOther model assumptions include other income and expense net of approximately $35,000,000 expense for the June and expect this to be roughly consistent throughout the calendar year. The effective tax rate assumption for June is 13.5%. Beginning in the September, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year, our effective tax rate will reflect the adoption of Global Taxation Pillar two, which is expected to increase the rate to approximately 14% for the second half of the calendar year. For the June, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $8.28 plus or minus $0.78 and non GAAP diluted EPS of $8.53 plus or minus $0.78 A quick update on our remaining performance obligations or RPO disclosure in our SEC filings. As a reminder, RPO is primarily a systems only metric for KLA.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nDo not report RPO during earnings as it is disclosed on our subsequently filed SEC ten Q and 10 ks reports. There is significant divergence in practice and companies have different definitions and disclosure practices on RPO. This lack of consistency among companies reporting can be a source of confusion for investors and make the disclosure difficult to compare across industries and peer companies. We will continue to provide our backlog balance annually in our 10 ks report. We will update our quarterly disclosures for RPO starting in the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty six, which is the quarter ending 09/30/2025 to be a transaction price for contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of the end of the quarter.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThis disclosure of RPO would be consistent with the disclosure of our industry peers. In conclusion, our near term revenue guidance continues to point to relative stability around current business levels despite the increased uncertainty from changes to global trade. We are staying close to customers as they also navigate this challenging environment. We continue to see solid growth in calendar twenty twenty five and expect to outperform the mid single digit WFE growth rate by several points. KLA is focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer term relevancy and growth expectations.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nWith the KLA operating model guiding our best in class execution, KLA is focused on implementing our strategic objectives designed to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, innovative solutions and operational excellence drives industry leading financial performance and allows us to return capital consistent. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q and A.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (Vice President, Investor Relations &amp; Market Analytics)\nThank you, Bren.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (Vice President, Investor Relations &amp; Market Analytics)\nOperator, can you please provide the instructions and begin the queue?\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. You. We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nGood afternoon and great job on another solid quarter of execution. Despite the view that the team is still going to drive $3,000,000,000 plus per quarter throughout the year, you're holding your WFE view of up mid single digits percentage year over year. You're not seeing any major changes to your customer spending plans. Yeah, you did highlight the 100 basis points hit to gross margin due to tariffs, but at the same time you did also take up your full year guidance on gross margins. But you're postponing your Analyst Day by nine months to a year on the potential, you know, trade and tariff uncertainty.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nI understand the direct impact concerns and risk on global demand for electronics, but is there also a significant tariff related risk on your equipment and systems post, let's say, the ninety day reciprocal tariff for Creeve. I mean, the team I thought was fairly geographically diversified across your manufacturing base, so I wouldn't think so. Maybe just take us through some of the puts and takes around tariffs and trade and your ability to modulate your global manufacturing operations under different tariff related scenarios to minimize the impact on your system shipping to different geographies?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nHey, Harlan, it's Bren. Thanks for the comments. There's a lot in there. The first thing I'll say is, yeah, our decision to push the Investor Day was really just related to the current uncertainty, obviously, trade, the structure and construct that's being discussed today is really unprecedented and we'll have to see how that settles out. I did talk a little bit about our view on tariff impact to KLA.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd of course, that's very fluid and could change. But we do see a little bit of a headwind in our gross margin as it relates to mostly our service business and having such a strong contract stream particularly in places like China where you have some reciprocal impact of parts going in that can have an effect on our business. So you have that exposure. You also have whatever we bring into The U. S.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nFactory. So some of that is being mitigated through different exemptions. And so I think there's some fluidity on that. So we'll see how that plays out over time. But and there's also some mitigation steps we can take from a process point of view in terms of how we manage our network, move parts around the world and so on.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nObviously, when you do things like that, you're going to focus on what's the right thing for the business operationally. And certainly in a higher structural tariff environment, you might consider doing things where a return on investment might be higher. So we have to go and evaluate those things. We're looking at that. We're also looking at longer term pricing strategies as well in terms of mitigation effects.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSo when we thought about the Investor Day, said, look, there's this tariff concern, what it does to in terms of second order impact to the macro, some unknowns associated with that. So we thought it was prudent for us to just move it into early twenty twenty six where we feel like we hopefully have a more stable environment. So we're looking forward to it. We're pretty excited about what's happening in the business. You pointed out a lot of our strength in our results and what we've seen over the last few years in terms of our relative growth and share of WFE.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSo we think we're pretty well positioned both in core WFE but also opportunities in advanced packaging. And our service business performing extremely well despite some of the challenges with export controls. So we think the business is in a pretty good place and we are just reacting to a global macro environment that's changed a lot in the last three months. As it relates to the footprint, we have a pretty diverse footprint around the world. We've established it over the past two different locations.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nI'd say again that you start with where it makes sense to do things operationally, whether it's cost or execution, talent, and so on. And then you optimize as it relates to taxes or incentives or other potential regulations. So those things can change. And so you have to make sure that the operational considerations are first and foremost. So we have a global footprint.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nWe'll assess the situation and we'll do what we think is right for the business over time. And that's pretty much all I have to say about\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nI appreciate that. And then maybe on a bright note, as Rick, as you mentioned in your shareholder letter, calendar 2024 share rankings are up for process control. The team and the process control segment outgrew overall WFE last year. And despite your dominant number one position, you're 6.5 times larger than your number two competitor in this space, you still gained 50 basis points of share and strong number one position. I think by my count in five out of the six major sub segments within process control.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nI think the one area where it was a bit of a surprise where you made significant progress was in e beam pattern wafer inspection and despite optical continuing to dominate at a 7x larger market versus e beam, the KLA team did double their e beam inspection revenues last year. You gained about 700 basis points of share there. So the team strategy has always been to introduce new solutions when the market is ready to adopt. So what's driving the incremental opportunity in e beam? And how is the KLA's e beam platform sort of differentiated? Right.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThanks, Harlan. Yes, I think that the progress we made in e beam has been long in coming. I mean, we've been investing in our platforms for many years in terms of getting the e beam products to where we thought they could really be supplemental to the optical and work in concert. And I think a lot of the success that we're now seeing is we got those platforms to start performing at a high level and customers have now had a chance to evaluate them. And I think what we're finding especially on the very high end of the most challenging layers of the most challenging nodes is that people are actually doing both.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThey're doing optical, MDEV on some of those layers. And the synergy between the two tools, I mean one of the things we always look the interoperability between the two so that you can leverage the strength of e beam with optical. So we're seeing those results. I think more importantly, our customers are seeing them and we felt good about it because as know, we've importantly, customers are seeing them we felt good about it because as you know, or customers to really test out, the capability. So we're confident that we're on a trajectory where we're to keep growing that business.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd we're at this point, we're really glad we invested for so many years. I there was a time where we're spending a lot of money on e beam and it took a long time to get these results. But we're really thrilled with where we are now and our customers are telling us we need more. And so from that standpoint, we're excited about the forecast. We ran into a problem last year where as we started getting demand, we didn't even have capacity.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nBrandon and the ops team had to ramp it up to be able to support it. So we're in good shape with that. We're getting great customer feedback and very excited about the progress we've made in EVIM.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nYes. Thanks Rick. Thanks Brent.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThanks.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd we'll go next to Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nThank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the services growth. I understand it's a bit pressured this year because of the loss of fabs in China. Can you talk about your full year outlook on the services for this year?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSure, Asif. So yes, the biggest impact we felt was in Q1 where growth quarter to quarter was fairly limited. It was despite losing access to the fabs to put up our fifty second quarter of year over year growth consecutive quarter of year over year growth was I think pretty impressive and the team did very well with that. Last year and when I think about just the semi PC part of the business, now there's also our EPC part of service. But semi PC grew in 2024 grew above trend line about mid teens about 16%.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThis year I think it will be low double digits. So if you look at total service growth, our expectations for the year are trending right around 10% or so. So a little bit below the long term target, but given the impact of those controls where you lose access to those tools. Now as those tools are providing or limited in what kind of supply they can provide to the broader market to meet demand, you would expect some capacity to potentially get added in other places that offsets that. So we would think over the long term that you get that business back as we model our service growth over the long run really based on long term growth expectations for internal in terms of useful life rising ASP, but also growth in semi revenue.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSo long term we feel very good about the long term target. In 2025 we're going to be slightly below it around 10%.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nGreat. And as my follow-up, on Advanced Packaging momentum, good to see you guys raising the bar to eight fifty million dollars and number one market share this year. Rick, if you can just pull the curtain a little bit on your kind of competitive positioning in Advanced Packaging? Are you stronger on the logic or the cobas side or the HPN side? And what are your thoughts about hybrid bonding adoption?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo I think I mentioned this before, Adam, that what we've really seen is the market in many ways has come to us. And this really kicked off a couple of years ago, mainly around packaging that we've seen pushed for AI applications and just the very the high cost of that entire package. And therefore, it can support the kind of cost per inspection that you couldn't support on frankly lower cost solutions in terms of the packages. So these packages, as you know, if you have a large chip combined with a number of memory chips that are stacked, the value of that's very high. So it's in both inspection and measurement, but also some of the process capability that we have in SPTS.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThat's really the differentiation is in the solutions. And in many ways what we've done is we've taken the products that we have for the front end and adapted them for the back end and that's what's getting traction now. And mainly it's with CoAOS and we've seen a lot of applications driving and we see big growth. So we talked about going to $500,000,000 8 50 million and frankly that growth trend continues and that's the message we're getting from our customers. So one of the things that we're still sorting through is what the available market is for KLA because we think about how much of WFE do we talk about, but there's also all this investment that's not necessarily included that in packaging.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd so we're still sorting through what that looks like and that's going to help us outperform the overall industry. So I think one other point on this is to Rick's point about being able to adapt our front end solutions to the back end is there are some incremental engineering requirements as it relates to handling of substrates and so on and different environmental conditions is that that's a lot of engineering at least from a sensitivity and performance point of view in the systems that has already been done. So the ability to take that also brings a nice incremental profit stream to the company as we leverage some of that capability. And as that market starts to move to needing more capability then you move up the value stack in terms of KLA solutions to address those challenges for our customers. So it's a great opportunity from a growth point of view, but it's also an opportunity from a margin point of view of something that was a bit of a headwind given the nature of what was required that turns into a tailwind as customers demand more capability from us. So we're really excited about that opportunity moving forward, particularly given the growth rates of advanced wafer level packaging that's likely faster than overall WFE growth over the next several years.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (Vice President, Investor Relations &amp; Market Analytics)\nThank you, Atif.\n\n**Operator**\nYou. Next we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThank you. I had a near and longer term question. On the near term, I saw that China, I think came in at about 26% in March. I think you had estimated closer to 29%. So does it go up in a kind of a flattish top line year?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nAnd related to that, the $500,000,000 impact that you had mentioned for the year, how much did you see in calendar Q1? How much more is left to go?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nVivek, on the math for China and you're right we spent some time on it last quarter and we thought that for 2025 the business would be somewhere overall our percent of business in China would be somewhere in high 20s maybe 30%. And our view is still consistent with that. Now I think it will be lumpy over the course of the year in terms of what shows up in any given quarter. So it was 26% in Q1. We'll see I'm not going to guide Q2.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nWe'll see what ends up coming in from a revenue recognition point of view. But over the course of the year right around 30% and I think when you look at that relative to our expectations for the year with some of the soft guidance we've given about second half revenue then that translates into China being down about 15% to 20% or so for the year for the overall company. As far as the export control impact, we really size that based on the impact that we had through the month of December shipments as it related to certain other customers that might have taken tools through 2025. And I didn't really focus on what happened in the given quarters. Our business is pretty fluid, so things move around.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nOur view of the impact is still consistent with what I said last quarter at $500,000,000 of revenue plus or minus $100,000,000 with roughly 70% of that being or 65% to 70% of that being systems, still the same. I'm not going to bridge to happened in Q1 versus other quarters. We've looked at the total impact over the next at the time roughly four plus quarters and that's how we size the impact.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nAll right. And for my follow-up, I know a little early, but I'm curious like what's on your dashboard to gauge whether 2026 WFE could be up down flat? How does China figure into it in terms of opportunity and risk? Because a lot of long term investors in KLA, they're always looking out. So how would you want them to think about what your opportunity set is in 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nRight. So 2026 for us right now, that was obviously a big question earlier this year as we thought about some of the macro uncertainty. The feedback we're getting for the AI build out, I think it's really important for everybody to understand what our customers are telling us is that they're still building for capacity that is less than the stated demand out there for the capability. So if you think about how many wafer starts are being started and what the implications on some of the hyperscaler CapEx would be, it's still understated. And so we think that that will continue to grow and that's the feedback we're giving.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd part of the thing that's so hard to handicap is how does this get impacted by some of the macro stuff. So the driver for us we said at the beginning of the year clearly was leading edge. And it's the three things we talked about. It's advanced logic in support of all the design starts, the bigger die, everything in support of AI, whether it's the training or the inference chips and or custom silicon. And then it's the HBM and there are multiple players in that and that's a more inspection intense technology than we've had in memory for a long time.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd then this really strong growth in packaging. I think we're still early days in all of those areas in terms of the amount of silicon that's being brought online. So I think in support of that, you're going to see continued growth at the leading edge, primarily driving those other sectors. The thing that's been slow has been we just haven't seen much come back in terms of handsets or PCs. And those are the markets that, as you know, consume a lot of the silicon.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo I think we'll know a lot more about 2026 as this build out for 2025 continues. But the conversations we're having right now absent any other macro jolts, I think looks pretty encouraging in terms of what the overall forecast looks like as we go out and really as we go out toward 02/1930. And so that's the we think we're early on. And today, as you know, aftermarket, there are some hyperscalers that announced continued and sometimes even increased investments in the AI infrastructure. So we think we're in a great position right now. Thank you, Vivek.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThank you, Vivek.\n\n**Operator**\nWe'll go next to Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on that, Rick. I mean, is cleaner space a potential kind of gating factor as you look into 2026? Or how do you think about that aspect of it?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nNo, I don't think so. I mean I think the question is going to be I think they can build depending on where they're building, they can get the shelves up and get them positioned to invest. So no, I don't think for the plans that we see I mean, I think I've always felt that the connection that one would draw from all the hyperscalers and the concern that people had about is AI overheated, I would look to the silicon at the leading edge being the governing factor. And the good news on that is I don't think it'll they're going to overbuild. And then the good news is there's going be steady growth the next several years to support it.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo that's why we're a little more sanguine about what are people saying about the overbuild. But I don't think there's overbuild and I think there is going to be additional capacity when needed. We're in a lot of conversations with our leading edge customers about that and we have pretty good insight into what their needs are going to be down to specific products. And in some areas, just I mentioned the e beam one earlier, we're getting heads up that we got to add capacity. And for us, it takes a while to be able to support that.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo I think we're in good shape for as we look out in the rest of the year and I think as we look into 2026, we're feeling pretty excited about the opportunity.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nThat's really helpful. And maybe one for Bren. Just I wanted to kind of better understand just the uptick in the full year gross margin, just given the fact of the dynamics around tariffs that you talked about. Maybe can you just help us like understand kind of what's giving you the confidence there to increase it?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nYes. No, it's I appreciate the question, Joe. And I think what we're seeing is it's from a mix point of view. We've had a bit of a headwind over the last few years as it relates to some of the cost dynamics as with the inflation that we experienced and what that meant to product cost. And as we're shipping new platforms, the opportunity for KLA generally to reset that as we deliver more favorable cost of ownership to our customers, but then reset that and the capability that exists in the next generation of product that comes to market.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSo that's certainly been a factor. I mentioned earlier that we're starting to see some scale benefits as it relates to Advanced Packaging, which we're encouraged by as well. So there's a number of factors. I'd say most of it is in product mix, but there's been certainly some opportunities for us to deal with some of the cost pressures we felt over the last few years. So yes, we've got the tariff impact, but despite that I feel that we are trending more or less in line with this expectation of margin somewhere around 62.5% as we finish the year plus or minus 50 basis points.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSo 63 in March and then the guidance 63 plus or minus one for June. And then as you look forward, we're going to be somewhere even with the full quarter of potential tariff impact is roughly 100 basis points. We're still somewhere in and around that 62% range given expectations for revenue levels that are relatively stable.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThanks, John.\n\n**Operator**\nWe'll take our next question from Tim Scholes, Weilander with Redburn and Linac. Please go ahead.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Partner)\nYes, hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just on the sequential Q on Q, could you just help us maybe with a bit of the gross profit bridge, pretty flat revenues, but a really decent impact on gross margin. Maybe if you just peel back some of the moving parts that would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nWell, I think your gross margin is roughly flat as you look at the because we're 63% and then we're guiding in March and we're guiding 63% at a roughly flat revenue number. There are some puts and takes in there as it relates to the different products that are revenue in the quarter. But in general, our expectation is pretty consistent for the company overall.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Partner)\nYes. I was thinking more about the March compared to the December.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nMarch compared to December, okay. Well, that's a great question. So if you look at March overall, it was mostly related to typically for KLA, our biggest issue tend to be really around the product mix of our business. And so we had some higher value systems. Not every product in KLA portfolio carries the same margin.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo the margin was more weighted to some of our higher value products.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Partner)\nOkay. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. I think if I caught it correctly, you talked about the service business basically being the sort of source of potential tariff impact to margins. Maybe if you could just give us a bit of color about that and also maybe just kind of how you're thinking about how you might respond to that pressure kind of on a medium to longer term basis? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nOne thing that's unique about KLA service business is it's a high percentage of our revenue is contract revenue. And so we deliver and customers pay us by service contract and we support system and make commitments for service and support uptime and performance availability and so on as it relates to those systems. So as part of that, then we have to then also ensure that we've got the parts whenever there are failures. So typically in a particular region, we are importing those parts to support the tools. And given it's a contract stream, we're the importer.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo potentially carry some exposure depending on where those parts might be coming from. And so there have been some exemptions that have come through as it relates to that particularly as it relates to parts going into China, but that's been where we do have some exposure. So we'll see how that plays out. So that's the aspect that's tied to service. Obviously, have tariffs potentially on parts that are coming from outside the country into The U.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nS. For tools that we're building in our factory in The U. S. That ultimately those tools stay in The U. S.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nIf they round trip out of The U. S, then you can then draw back some of that. But as it relates to the service piece, the issue is, as I talked about. Now if you're in a billable situation, you could potentially just the customer because it comes an ex works type transaction, the customer would potentially then have to be the importer and then have the tariff liability. But because of the contract structure, it's a little bit different for us.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nNow ultimately over time, if you're ending up with a structural cost increase, you have to come up with ways to pass that cost along. And so there are different pricing strategies that we need to consider in our business based on what the long term implications are. Thank you, Tim.\n\n**Operator**\nWe'll go next to C. J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Brian, I'm just trying to dig into your kind of relatively stable half on half revenue outlook better than some of your peers. So curious, is that a function of perhaps less memory exposure, sustainable foundry or greater seasonality from PCB in the second half or SPTS kind of taking off?\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nI guess what are the key drivers of driving that sustainability?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nYes. I'm taking a quick look here C. J. As I look at it, it looks on a half to half point of view, it looks fairly stable. Would say memory potentially could tick up a bit and foundry logic looks like it is probably make it tick down a little bit.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nBut I don't see a lot of moving parts here as I look at it moving forward. I'd say the percent of businesses at least as it relates to our semiconductor customers is pretty consistent.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nGreat. And then I guess as my follow-up, you highlighted great growth in advanced packaging, the lion's share of that is COWAS. Can you speak to kind of the work you're doing on HBM? How you're thinking about insertions? Is it HBM4, 4E?\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nAnd is there a way to kind of size the opportunity sitting here today? Or is it too early? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nYes. So I would say that we have we're certainly seeing increasing momentum. Most of our exposure and the share that we've seen, the share gain we've seen has been on the logic side. But in high bandwidth memory as the customers are going to increase stacks of chips, it's creating incremental opportunity. So we feel like we're getting more traction.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nIt's driving the need for more capability and we're getting more traction with certain customers. So we think over time as you see a selection process as a customer transitions, creates an opportunity for us to compete. For some business, as you know those customers are running at pretty aggressive capacity levels in terms of delivering for their customers. So when you're in that environment, you don't necessarily want to change anything. So I think we have to wait for a selection as you move into higher stacks.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd then obviously ultimately as you think about technology changes with hybrid bonding down the road creates another incremental opportunity. So we're seeing increasing momentum on the memory side and would expect that to continue as we go through really as we continue this year and into next year.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nNext we'll go to Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nYes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, Brent, when I look at your U. S.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nRevenues, it's up Q o Q, but the dollar figures are still pretty low. And I'm just trying to reconcile that with what TS has said about investing in Arizona. Do you think the process control being an early cyclical, some of the early purchases for Arizona are done? Or do you think there's still potential for the rest of the year? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nMost of our business with our biggest customers have been more into centric. So that isn't most of that is going to Taiwan and not into Arizona. Arizona has been a slow investment cycle over the last few years. So there's been a level of business that we've had that's been at kind of low levels lower levels consistently over the course of a longer period of time. But given the focus and the drive on into that's driving most of our business into Taiwan.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Got it. And then a quick follow-up on the tariffs and thanks for the color on the service impact from the tariffs. I understand a lot of moving parts, but I'm just wondering if it ever comes to it, can you meet non U. S.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nDemand from your non U. S. Manufacturing facilities and U. S. Demand from U. S. Or is it not as simple as that?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAs it relates to service?\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nNo, as it relates to systems.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nWell, look, as I said in the first question, I think it was was Carlin's question at the beginning, we've it over the last couple of decades. We've moved products around the world depending on what makes sense operationally for us. You can't do anything in a short period of time. In a longer period of time, you'd have to consider. I think it'd be very hard for us to have complete duplicative capability across factories.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nWe certainly aren't in a position necessarily to do that today. But could you over time increase your flexibility? You'd have to make some investments to be able to do that. You potentially could do those things. But you have to be comfortable that you're facing an environment that is not going to change because those are significant investments you'd have to make.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.\n\n**Operator**\nNext we'll go to Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Tom O’Malley** (Analyst)\nHey guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first was just in regards to CJ's question earlier just on the second half and whether it's weighted memory or foundry logic. And it sounded like memory was up a little bit, foundry logic maybe down a little bit. If you look at the mix of memory, some of your peers have already talked about like a sharper fall off in the second half when it comes to NAND, and I fully appreciate that your business is very small there. But is the correct interpretation of that, that the DRAM side gets a little bit stronger and you see a little weakness on NAND?\n\n**Tom O’Malley** (Analyst)\nOr are you seeing anything different just given the makeup or the timing of your NAND business?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nI would say the DRAM is the biggest driver. What you're seeing in NAND is more technology investments and some upgrades. So there's some activity there, but it's fairly limited. Most of what's driving our business is investment supporting high bandwidth memory.\n\n**Tom O’Malley** (Analyst)\nHelpful. And then I think that it's obviously brave of you guys to go out there and kind of talk about tariff impacts already when many of your peers have kind of said, Hey, don't look at the second half, and you guys are being pretty prescriptive when it comes to the gross margin. So maybe it's helpful. Can you guys talk about what you guys did in order to get to that 100 basis points per quarter? Like did you look at different facilities?\n\n**Tom O’Malley** (Analyst)\nDid you take everything as a whole? Like any kind of description or color as to how you got to that number would be super helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nWell, so Tom, what I didn't do was what we had to do was really just drill through all of our business, right? And there's a fair amount of unknowns. What I didn't say early on was the various caveats, right, that if things could change. And certainly, we're in a pretty fluid dynamic and who knows something could change in a short period of time. We'll see what happens in ninety days and so on.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nBut we know what we're shipping, what we're bringing in with our build plans and given our lead times, what's coming into our factories around the world, obviously we have visibility into the contract streams from a service point of view given how unique that business is in the industry and how our customers our percent of businesses that's contract basis is much higher than what other companies might have. And look, we'll see. I said roughly around 100 basis points. We'll see if things change. But at the end of the day, I can look at what's in service.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nI can look at what's in the factories. There are some potential unknowns as you think about what might come from suppliers, but we think we handicap that as best we could. And then there's obviously mitigation steps that we'll take over time to offset whatever pressures we might feel. So me add because it reports to Bren, but we have a really strong logistics team. And the same team that got us through COVID without missing deliveries and without lifting guidance was the team that drilled through all this.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo I would say that Bren's team was all over this, and that's why we were able to, like, assess the impact and then change even during the week we were doing it or a few days as the rules change. So, I don't think it was luck and we're not guessing. We did a lot of detailed work. The assumptions could change. The concern we have about having everybody together for an Investor Day is something could change the morning of that day.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd so we're kind of waiting for things to settle out. But it was a lot of hard work. We know where our parts come. We understand the rules and we applied them. That's how we got there. You.\n\n**Operator**\nNext we'll go to Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you. Sorry guys. I have a follow-up about the second half comments that you made in particular about the foundry logic. I think the comment was that it's going to tick down a little bit. Was down a bit and then you're guiding kind of flattish for this quarter.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nI'm guessing most of that is China. I'm just curious as to how you're expecting N2 demand to kind of fare and if you can talk about where we are in the N2 cycle? And then I guess as we go to next year, when do we expect 1,400,000,000.0 to kind of kick in?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nWell, so I think around N2, the investment cycle we're seeing this year looks pretty strong as we've said and we feel pretty good about its continuation Our customers are going to add in this first year somewhere around 40,000 to 50,000 wafer starts. And we think that you'll see at least a doubling of that into next year, maybe more. So we feel pretty good about. Some of the moving parts is it's not our only customer that's investing here.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd so, like I said earlier, I think half to half it's things tick up a little bit, things tick down a little bit, but more or less our mix of business expectations from where we started the year is more or less about the same.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. And then, more of a longer term question. I'm just curious to understand a little better what the implications from high NA. I know it's early days, but as we go to high NA, I'm reading that the reticle sizes will come down. I'm guessing the complexity will increase quite a bit and of course packaging complexity will go up.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nBut if reticle sizes come down, so just curious to understand what the implications for semi PC intensities with high NA? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nI think those are exactly some of the issues that are our customers are considering as they think about when to insert and how much to insert. Think that the one thing that is definitely true is the reason you want high NA is because you want to print smaller features. And that's always been a driver for our business because the same thing that allows you to print smaller features means that smaller defects matter more. So our customers when they go, when they increase the resolution on their lithography have to increase their sensitivity on their inspection. That's a good thing.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd also at the same time, it means that we've got to drive our capability to have more detection on those advanced devices. The reticle quality and the verification of reticles has been a huge driver in EUV in general. And that created a whole separate category of what we call print check, which is where people take the wafers that are being printed by EUV and they inspect the wafer to verify the design. Even though there are tools for reticle, there's also that additional. We would expect, especially in the early days of high NA that there would be more reticle check required.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo from our standpoint, it drives increased percent of inspection and measurement because of the continued scaling, but it also we're working very closely with our customers who are considering that because one of the decision points they have is do they have metrology and inspection to make those nodes work. So that's a big part of the conversation. So I would say that the most likely scenario for High NA is when it gets introduced, it will be at a limited number of layers on whatever device or node that it's introduced. And our customers, because they have to be thoughtful, will have a backup plan in terms of whether it's multi patterning or other ways to achieve their objectives. So it's in the end good for us as EUV has been good for driving relevance and of inspection, but I think it remains to be seen when that timing actually happens and what if devices. And I'm quite sure because our customers keep telling us it's going to be based on their economics, not just on the performance, but on the total cost of implementation.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nThank you, Srini.\n\n**Operator**\nWe'll next go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Bren, I wanted to ask about semi systems half on half. You quantified in the presentation, you actually quantified the outgrowth relative to this mid single digit WFE this year. You said you're gonna outgrow by several points. So if WFE is up five, I take several to mean three.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nSo that means systems will grow like eight, and you did 7.5 in systems last year. So puts you at eight one for the year. So if we know what you're doing in the first half, it implies the back half systems is down, like, 15% half on half. That's a lot. So do you take issue with that math?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nBecause I thought systems were gonna be more, flattish half on half. Did like something change? Thanks.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nYes. Hey, Tim, I'm looking at the numbers here and just on revenue expectations. I think semi PC systems are going be roughly flat in the second half of the year.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThen you will outgrow by a lot more than several.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nYes, it's several points relative to the if WFE is up mid single digits, I think we do several points better than that.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nYes. Well, if those are the\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nnumbers you're to be up\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nlike 12, so that's like a lot more than several. But anyway, okay. So then on RPO, so why stop reporting RPO midyear? Was it like causing a problem? And then I guess, you said that you're going to include it to be the transaction price for contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue at\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nthe end\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nof the quarter. So how is the new practice different from the current practice?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSo we're not going to stop at mid fiscal year. We're just giving you a heads up that we're going to make a change going into our new fiscal year, which begins on July 1. So it's the September 30 ending quarter. If you look at the quarter we completed and you'll see the actual numbers based on the historical practice in the 10 Q that we'll file at the end of this week is the RPO came down to about $8,900,000 changed a couple of hundred million dollars so not really much change in it. Our view moving forward was one of the things that was and it's something that we spent a significant amount of time on over the last several months is that companies the disclosure practices across companies vary widely here about what RPO really is.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so what we're really trying to do here is converge towards where we think the majority of companies are. I mean the whole point of disclosures is to be able to make adequate comparisons across companies, across industries. And you certainly can't do that with this metric given the wide divergence in practices that people have related to it. So we think our view is a good balanced view moving forward. What's actually an obligation is something that has shipped to customers and hasn't FPA ed whether it's that or whether it's a service contract that's been signed.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so our RPO guidance will converge to that, which is more of a deferred revenue disclosure across our systems and service. And we'll provide a backlog assessment, is more or less than what we were doing before in our case going forward. So we're going continue doing as we complete this year and then we're going to make some changes moving next year, so we can be consistent a little bit more consistent with what the rest of industry and equipment. And so I think even looking across large caps, you'll see that the three large caps do it have been doing it all differently. So it's a source of confusion. I get it a lot. So what we're trying to do is align more closely with what some of our peers are doing.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay, Brad. Awesome. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Tim. And we have time for one more question. We'll go next to Melissa Weathers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (Vice President - Equity Research)\nHello. Thank you for letting me ask a question and squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on the high volume manufacturing side. This is a big theme that you guys talked about at your last Analyst Day as you shift from more of like R and D type spending to HVM spending and being a bigger part of the mix there. So how are you seeing this play out in the current leading edge nodes and maybe future nodes?\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (Vice President - Equity Research)\nLike is there any way you can help us contextualize how much the HVM opportunity is for KLA?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nHistorically, KLA was more levered towards R and D and fab ramp and as the fab moved to entitlement yield levels, there was a reduction in process control intensity and a shift in our customers' strategy to focus in and driving productivity in the fab. As the design start environment has picked up over the last several nodes, it has driven more challenges into high volume production as customers are trying to manage yield across different process flows in a very different or robust design mix. And so as a result of that, you end up with different designs that test design rules in different ways. Our customers don't want to start any more wafers than they have to if they deliver the tight market windows. And so you're seeing the adoption of more process control in a high mix foundry in high volume production.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo it is changing. And we're also seeing even back boarding where they're seeing a change in mix where a fab at N5, for example, had a certain toolset expectation based on an expected type of mix. But as you've seen more and more HPC products move through those fabs, it's driven the need for different and more capability. So you're seeing a lot more adoption in production than what you used to see if you go back ten to twenty years in the industry. And so I think it's just really reflective of the dynamic environment our customers are trying to manage to with process windows that are extremely tight with these leading edge nodes.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional and closing remarks.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (Vice President, Investor Relations &amp; Market Analytics)\nGreat. Thank you everyone for your time and your attention, your interest in KLA. We appreciate it. I know it's busy earnings day. We will be catching up with all of you at the upcoming conferences and meetings.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (Vice President, Investor Relations &amp; Market Analytics)\nWith that, I'll turn it back to the operator for any final closing instructions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And this concludes the KLA Corporation March quarter twenty twenty five earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGood afternoon, my name is Todd and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and webcast. All participants' lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session.

I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations and Market Analytics)\nWelcome to our earnings call to discuss the December quarter and calendar year 2024 results and outlook. I am joined by our CEO Rick Wallace and our CFO Brent Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market closed and available at ir.kla.com along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. All full year references we make are to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations and Market Analytics)\nAny forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will start with some introductory comments followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Before I turn the call over to our CEO Rick Wallace, I wanted to remind everyone that our 2025 Investor Day will be held on the morning of June 18th in New York City. Now over to Rick.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nThank you Kevin. I will summarize KLA's overall performance for calendar 2024 and the December quarter and cover company highlights and updates on the industry landscape. For calendar 2024, KLA again delivered relative growth, outperformance, strong profitability and healthy return to shareholders.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nSpecifically, 2024 revenue grew 12% to a record $10.85 billion and the process control revenue grew by over 12% which indicates increased market share while the services business grew 15% to $2.5 billion per year. Also for the calendar year, KLA maintained industry leading gross and operating margins at 61% and 41% respectively. The company grew free cash flow to $3.4 billion and returned $2.9 billion in a combination of dividends and share buybacks.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nKLA's outperformance for the year was driven by a return to growth at the leading edge which includes increased investment in AI, high performance computing and continued momentum in advanced packaging as well as sustainable performance for KLA services business, and turning to the December quarter, results for KLA came in above the midpoint of non-GAAP guidance range despite navigating through the business impact of new U.S. Government export controls which were released late in the quarter. Specifically, the quarter revenue topped $3 billion for the first time, diluted non-GAAP was $8.20, finishing at the upper end of the guidance range. For the quarter, GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. The business landscape is performing as expected and we're encouraged by the strong demand we're experiencing in leading edge logic and with specific memory customers supporting high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nKLA's differentiated portfolio of solutions aligns exceptionally well with enabling our customers to navigate increasing complexity, growing design starts and larger semiconductor devices in an environment of rising semiconductor demand. Specific highlights in the quarter include a combination of strong sequential and year-over-year revenue growth demonstrates an improving industry environment. KLA is specifically positioned to benefit from accelerated growth at the leading edge across all sectors. There are technology development investments supporting AI and HBM as well as strengthening supply-demand environment which positions the wafer fab equipment industry for growth in calendar 2025. AI continues to be a crucial catalyst for KLA. We are well aware of the recent revelations of DeepSeek and the implications that it portends a diminished demand for advanced semiconductors in support of the AI infrastructure buildout.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nAs a company that has been developing AI models for use in our own inspection systems for many years, our own experience supports the theory that increased compute efficiency enables more adoption of AI in our platforms. The demand is clearly elastic as it pertains to the demand environment for advanced semiconductors. We see no reason to believe that the increased compute efficiency in AI will have an impact on the advanced demand environment in the foreseeable future. AI is both an important driver and enabler of KLA's business. Specific drivers connected to AI that are a positive for KLA's growth are higher volume and higher value wafer demand, more complex designs, accelerating product cycles, larger die size and growing advanced packaging demand.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nThese trends demonstrate the increasing value of process control in assisting our customers through managing a dynamic production environment as investments and complexity increase. Exemplifying this momentum for our advanced packaging portfolio continued in the quarter. The growing demand for more powerful systems of chips is driving more complex heterogeneous chip integration enabled by advanced packaging which increases the value of process control in the chip package. This is fueling growth for KLA in our broad portfolio of systems. KLA advanced packaging revenue grew to approximately $500 million in calendar 2024 and is expected to exceed $800 million in calendar 2025, up from our last estimate of $750 million. KLA service business grew to $667 million in the December quarter, up 4% sequentially and 18% year over year. This makes 50 consecutive quarters of growth for our services business on a year over year basis.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nFinally, quarterly free cash flow was $757 million in calendar 2024 and the free cash flow margin was 31% over the same period, putting KLA amongst the top companies in the S&P 500. Total capital return in the December quarter was $877 million comprised of $650 million in share repurchase and $227 million in dividends. Total capital return over the past 12 months was $2.9 billion. KLA views consistent and healthy capital returns as fundamental to delivering value for shareholders. KLA's December quarter results delivered strong sequential and year over year growth which validates KLA's process control, leadership and portfolio strength. KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams continues to be the foundation of our sustained success. We'll now pass the call over to BREN to cover financial highlights and our outlook.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks Rick. KLA's December quarter results demonstrate market leadership combined with the consistent execution and dedication of our global team to meet customer commitments and drive sequential and year-over-year growth. Profitability improvements. Revenue was $3.08 billion above the guidance midpoint of $2.95 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.20 above the guidance midpoint. GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. Gross margin was 61.7%. Operating expenses were $596 million. Operating expenses were comprised of $342 million in R&D and $254 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 42.3%. Other income and expense net was a $31 million expense. The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.7%. Net income was $1.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $850 million and free cash flow was $757 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets, major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nMoving to the Balance Sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.9 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. During the December quarter, we retired our $750 million November 2024 bonds at maturity. Cash on hand, KLA's balance sheet provides the ability to fund our growth strategies, organic and inorganic, and offer attractive capital returns to shareholders. Turning to our outlook, the industry outlook continues to gain momentum in the near term driven by an increasing investment in leading-edge logic, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. We expect the WFE market to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2025 from the high $90 billion level for calendar 2024.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nGrowth in calendar 2025 is expected to be fueled principally by increasing investment in both leading edge foundry logic and memory to support growing AI and premium mobile demand offset by lower overall demand from China due to the digestion of elevated levels of investment over the past couple of years. In an encouraging development, our top customer recently said in an earnings call that they expect a number of new tapeouts at N2 with a 2 nanometer node in the first two years to be higher than both N3 and N5 in their first two years fueled by both smartphone and HPC applications. As communicated in early December, we continue to estimate the impact on KLA's revenue in calendar 2025 from recent export controls in China to be approximately $500 million plus or minus $100 million, with roughly 70% of the impact affecting our systems business.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nWhile we are hopeful based on our interpretation of the regulations that there should be licensing opportunities that will mitigate some of this impact, we are taking a cautious view given the significant delays in processing license requests by the U.S. government over the past few years. However, given KLA's business momentum, market share opportunities and higher expected process control intensity is the leading edge across all segments. We are confident we will continue to deliver growth outperformance compared with the WFE market in 2025. KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $3 billion plus or minus $150 million.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nOur revenue guidance is up 27% year over year at the midpoint, further illustrating the improvement we expect to see in calendar 2025. Foundry Logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 73%, and memory is expected to be approximately 27% of semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 75% of the revenue mix and NAND the remaining 25%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 62% plus or minus 1 percentage point, or up approximately 30 basis points sequentially at the midpoint despite slightly lower revenue primarily due to more favorable product mix expectations for calendar 2025 based on expectations for business mix across systems and service systems, product mix and factory utilization. We expect gross margin for the year to be approximately 62% plus or minus 50 basis points.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $585 million as we continue to make significant product development and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Given our expectations for company growth over the next couple of years, we will maintain our operating expense trajectory for the remainder of calendar 2025. We expect sequential increases of approximately $15 million in incremental operating expenses per quarter. This is driven by our priority around our product development roadmap requirements as well as revenue growth expectations. Our business model is predicated on ensuring 40%-50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over the long run. Other model assumptions include non-GAAP other income and expense net of approximately a $36 million expense for the March quarter and expect this to be roughly consistent throughout the calendar year.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nThe tax assumption for March remains at 13.5% and we expect this to remain through the June quarter beginning in the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year. Our tax rate will reflect the adoption of global taxation Pillar Two. Based on our current modeling, we think Pillar Two implementation will drive the tax rate slightly higher to approximately 14% in the second half of the calendar year. We will provide an update on this planning rate mid-year if necessary. For the March quarter, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $7.77 plus or minus $0.60, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.05 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 133.3 million shares. In conclusion, our near-term revenue guidance points to relative stability around current business levels.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nBased on the strength of our backlog and market position, we see growth in calendar 2025 and expect to outperform the mid single digit growth rate we expect from the WFE market. KLA's focus on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer term relevancy and growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding our best in class execution, KLA is focused on implementing our strategic objectives designed to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, innovative solutions and operational excellence drives industry leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q&A.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations and Market Analytics)\nThank you, Brent. Operator, can you please provide the instructions for Q&A\n\n**Operator**\nat this time? If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, you may do so by pressing Star two. We remind you to please unmute your line when introduced and if possible pick up your handset for optimal sound quality. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.\n\n**Operator**\nWe'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n**Michael Mani** (Equity Research Associate)\nHi, this is Michael Mani on for Vivek Arya. Thank you for taking our questions. To start, we heard from two of your peers yesterday. The peer that is etch and deposition focused issued a pretty similar WFE view to you guys from the mid-single digits, while the other reiterated their annual guide suggesting that litho spending remains healthy.\n\n**Michael Mani** (Equity Research Associate)\nThe question is if total WFE is increasing something like $5 billion or so this year, but within that litho WFE is also increasing, actually ends up also growing pretty strong, so consuming a good part of that incremental growth. What exactly is happening to the process control part of the market this year? And if process control WFE is growing solidly, which it seems like it is, does that suggest that mid single digits for WFE could be conservative? Or are there other parts of the market that are shrinking by that much? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nAnd pardon me, to the speakers. Do you have us muted?\n\n**Operator**\nMy apologies.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nYes, yes, this is Brent. I'll take that one. And the guidance was clear that we think it's somewhere in that range of about $5 billion, to use your number, in 2025 versus 2024.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nWe feel pretty good about KLA's share of overall WFE opportunity into next year. Obviously, as we move into 2025 we've got more investment and leading edge and that's certainly a nice driver for our business. And we're already seeing KLA's share of WFE at the N2 node being meaningfully greater than what we saw at N3. What's happening in the DRAM. First, advanced DRAM is good for us with scaling and EUV, but also as you look at high bandwidth memory. High bandwidth memory is also driving process control intensity due to the lack of redundancy, more complex logic circuitry in the base die, the need for more reliability, bigger chips and so on. So we feel pretty good about all of that. And then I think finally the growth that we referenced in the letter in advanced packaging is accelerating for the company.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nIt seems like every quarter I keep raising the numbers, so I'm pretty excited about the opportunities that are there. And it seems to be accelerating as we move into this year. So for all those reasons, it looks like Process Control Intensity KLA share of market looks to increase in 2025 based on our assessment and in an environment where memory is probably a higher % given expected growth in DRAM. I think the dynamics I talk about more than offset a slightly changing mix that's still Foundry Logic heavy, but a little bit more DRAM in terms of our views on 25.\n\n**Michael Mani** (Equity Research Associate)\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you. And for my next question, just could you help us with the linearity for revenue this year to the best extent you can? You know, just because we're kind of at a high watermark for revenue this quarter. So should we expect, you know, maybe it could be more first half weighted versus second half, especially given China's normalizing into the year and there's this impact of the export restrictions that we should consider. Thank you very much.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, the second half. I'm not going to comment on it. As we said in the letter, we feel pretty good about relative stability as we look at the funnel here moving forward. We'll see as we start to move through the year what happens. But in terms of how we're modeling the company, it seems that we're bouncing around this $3 billion level, plus or minus at least as we look at the first half of the year.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nNext question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. As a reminder, that's star one to ask a question. Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, in process control, strong outperformance for the team in calendar 24. I think your process control systems business was up 15% year over year. Right. That's versus WFE up in a mid-single-digits. But if I look back over the past five years, the team's process control business has outgrown WFE on average by about 500-700 basis points per year. So given this year is going to be more leading-edge technology inflection driven, which is where obviously you guys have a strong leadership position, is it fair to assume that if WFE is up mid-single-digits percentage points this year that your process control business should grow kind of low-to-mid-teens % in calendar 25?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nHarlan, that's a thank you for those comments. Obviously we're not going to guide for the year, but clearly we're feeling great about the position we have. And a couple things have changed, as you well know, in terms of the dynamics. One, because we've resumed scaling, there's more opportunity for more inspection. So I've always viewed the opportunities as being twofold. One, there needed to be an opportunity and then we had to have a solution. And so, and sometimes we've had the case where for example, if you go back years to 3D NAND, where of course if we could have looked through and found defects, there would have been opportunity.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nIt was tough to do, but now we're really at an interesting point where the leading edge every dynamic is going kind of in our favor. In terms of higher value wafers, you've got larger die size, we talked about this in the prepared remarks.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nAnd you've got accelerated technology nodes and more layers that need to be figured out. The other dynamic of course that you know is HBM is looking more like logic than it used to. Less redundancy, more valuable per bit and of course the dynamic around packaging. So we feel great, as Bren said about process control's position and overall the spend for our customers and that's the conversation we're having with our leading customers is very focused on getting that availability and being supportive of their technology ramps as they make these big investments going forward.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nThat's great, thank you for that. And then on the 60% growth outlook for your advanced packaging business this year. Can you just kind of help us unpack that a bit? How much of that mix is 2.5D packaging technology like CoWoS versus HBM versus other packaging types?\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nAnd what is the rough mix of process control versus semi manufacturing systems? And then we're already starting to see some future AI designs moving to 3D SoIC technology starting next year. Is this a further tailwind for the team given, you know, the higher complexity of these next generation 3D architectures?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nYes, great questions. I mean I think two things have happened and we got this early indication from our leading customers a year and a half, two years ago that the challenges in packaging were going to look a lot more like what was going on in the front end. And they asked us to make some of the platforms that we use for the front end available for packaging. And so back to the question, what is this?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nA lot of it's inspection and metrology derivatives of the projects and programs that we have and have many years of experience with. There's clearly some plasma dicing, so SPTS is part of that overall solution. But there's no question that our customers are driving. As you know, it's a very expensive. When you have these high-end chips along with this complex packaging and this hetero, the risks are very high if there's yield loss. So there's more inspection opportunity there and we feel great about the continued growth as we go forward. Right now it's mostly 2.5D but 2.5D HPC but we see it's going to go forward and our customers are. This is an area that's moving very quickly and because they need solutions, they're very focused on making sure we understand them as we go forward. Hey, Harlan Sur here. It's about 65%-70% semi PC versus process.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nGreat insights. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper in your outperformance relative to WFE within that you're including that $500 million China hit. And so we'd love to hear, I guess beyond the rising process control intensity at 2 nanometer and HBM, are there other drivers? Are those the two principal ones we should be thinking about?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah, those are the, those are the two principal ones. Plus I'm sure again yeah, you've got higher intensity at the node into Rick's point. We feel very good about some product momentum in a number of our markets.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nSo that's. And then I think finally as you look at that and you look at what's driving growth within process control, you've got an acceleration in certain products where we have a strong market position. So they're influencing the growth rate obviously more relative to the overall. So that also drives an improvement in share. Optical pattern inspection being one of those areas. Well, and reticle and we saw some improvement in some of the work in reticle and including the Gen 5 CJ for you know, print check which is obviously shows up in the optical but it's part of that solution. So look, we're feeling pretty good and there was some investment made by our customers to support prior nodes once they realized that there was still a yield opportunity there.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nJust to follow up on that, you, Rick, you talked about share gain. Can you elaborate on that?\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nAnd then my second question would be on service. You talked about hitting kind of the long term growth rate over time, but would be curious given kind of the China impact, how you're thinking about growth for overall service in calendar 2025. Thanks so much.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nSure. So on the share side, I think there's a couple areas that might be more obvious than others. One is optical, simply because optical grew disproportionately perhaps in the rest of the market and we have a large share there. So that creates a greater overall position there. We had some really strong momentum in E-beam, but then the other area where we really saw some strong performance was in packaging. And so that's the one where the teams have really done a great job focusing the last couple of years and we've been able to see continued momentum there.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nSo we feel pretty good about it. You know, obviously the numbers for the year aren't going to come out, but we have gained a lot of share in the last couple years and the question was, would there be any retrenchment? We feel pretty good about where we are for service. Anytime you lose access to a fab, you have the immediate headwind that you can't get access to that equipment. So as I look at growth this year, I think growth is probably in the high single digits for service, which is below the long term model. We outperformed the long term model by a little bit in 2024.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nOver time, though, it's generally our view, at least in terms of how we run the company, as we think about the efficiency of the market, that if you have fabs that are inhibited from being able to supply, that capacity has to get added somewhere else, and so that would create an opportunity for us to make some of that up over the very long term, so, and obviously that would mean that you would end up with whatever was spent before would have to be replaced somewhere else, so I think over the long run we feel pretty good about the growth trajectory in our long term model, but in the short run it does affect obviously your ability to get at that capacity, which puts pressure on the growth rate and also puts some pressure on our ability to move resources around.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nAnd so we'll have to deal with some inefficiencies. We've staffed up to support those fabs and now we have to move those folks to support other customers. So there's a few moving parts, but in the long run, we feel pretty good about the trajectory given the higher value offerings, what we're seeing in terms of pricing as it relates to new products, the opportunities in packaging for incremental service. So I think that the drivers for service are all pretty compelling. Obviously the install base is growing, lifetimes are increasing. So in the long run, we feel pretty good about the long term target.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nThanks so much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joe Quatrocchi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah, thank you for taking that question. Just to follow up on the services impact from China. Just given the fact that most of your services is highly recurring, do we just take that, I guess quarterly kind of run rate impact all in the, in the March quarter or, and then grow from there or is there, you know, further kind of headwinds to think about in the out quarters?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah, I think that's the way to think about it because you lose what you would have gotten at those fabs and then it grows from there. So I think that's a reasonable way to think about it.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nOkay, perfect. And then just thinking about capital and physical process control on the DRAM side, can you talk about just the difference in HBM process control intensity relative to conventional DRAM, just how to think about that adoption? I know obviously EUV being adopted across the board is helpful for you guys too.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah. So as I said earlier, right, with an HBM device, you've got a few things that are happening. You've got bigger die because you have to drill the TSV, they're bigger, so you have less redundancy, which historically has been pretty significant DRAM. And so that's been a headwind to process control intensity. The logic circuitry is more complex, the reliability on all the die in the stack is higher. So for all those reasons, it's very good for process control intensity. I think overall for DRAM, it's moving the needle probably somewhere from, we'll call it the 9 to 10 range, where we've been historically as a percent of WFE, that it probably moves up a good 100 to 150 basis points from there. Now obviously mix will affect that. Most of the focus is on HBM in terms of new requirements. So mix dynamics could affect that.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nBut we feel pretty good about these dynamics as they affect and drive the DRAM market. And it's most pronounced in the latest technology nodes. And that's where we're seeing it more. And so it's going to take a little bit of a time for us to really figure out what that overall looks like. I think by investor day we should be in a pretty good position to talk about it on a longer term basis.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nHelpful. Thank you.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks. Bren, can you give us RPO? It was supposed to be up. Can you give us the number?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. So RPO was down about $900 million. About half of that was related to de-bookings we took due to the December 2nd regulations.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nSo about half of it related to that and then the other half shipment levels were higher. So that's how it played out in the quarter.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Okay, thanks. And then process control systems you said pretty stable from here. But what about EPC? It was up a lot this quarter. Well, it didn't grow that much, but it grew a lot in Q4. So how to think about it for this year? Can it grow 10, perhaps low double digits this year?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nYes, I think overall EPC is probably going to be about mid single digits. You have to remember that what shows up in EPC is flat panel business. And so at the end of this quarter we will be done shipping systems for flat panel after we announced end of manufacturing 12 months ago.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nSo you have the flat panel revenue coming out. And so obviously that in this year affects the overall growth rate of flat panel of the EPC businesses as we report those segments. So overall we feel pretty good. If you look at SPTS growth, especially in semi, especially semiconductor, mostly driven by advanced packaging growth year to year. Ikos component inspection, again a packaging-centric business is also growing. PCB businesses are more tied to mobility and capacity so less growth in those areas. And then of course you got the offset from losing the FPD piece. Now losing the FPD piece does enhance the margin ratios. Gross margin is probably 20 basis points higher. I think operating margins are probably 30 basis points higher because the revenue mix is a little bit richer.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nAnd certainly that's factored into how we guided gross margins as we look at next year or look at this year, 2025.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Brad.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my question. And Rick and Bren, thanks for quantifying the $500 million-plus dollar impact from export control. We also spoke about China WFE digestion. I'm just kind of curious if you layer in the digestion from China, how to think about your decline in China sales year over year on top of export controls in 2025 versus 2024.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah, I'll try to help with that. I mean, obviously we'll have to see how the year plays out. But if you look at how we finished the year, right, this last quarter was 36%. We finished the year at 41% of our business in China.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nAs we look at 2025, I think that percentage drops to about, you know, 29% plus or minus a point or two as we go forward here. And so when you do the math on that, assuming the stability that we articulated about our top line, as we think about where we are right now, that translates into the overall China business down somewhere around 20% or so.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it, got it. That's very helpful. And then another question is again on China. I apologize for this, but you know, when you look at your numbers compared to some of your peers, over the last two quarters, your China sales have been more resilient compared to your peers. Is this due to the wafer business or is it because China is building domestic vertical capacity like what's happening there, that kind of makes you relatively more resilient than your peers?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah, I think the easiest way to think about it is you have to remember that KLA is really about helping customers qualify processes and speed time to results, yield learning and so on. And so as a result you end up with, particularly with Greenfield fabs, a higher level of adoption as that fab's opening and more continuous investment at lower levels. So when a customer goes to add a significant amount of capacity, obviously more capacity centric peers are going to participate, but then they'll get it in that quarter and then it'll fall off where ours tends to be a little bit more consistent in terms of the investment profile.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nAnd so it also, I think, tends to hold up because I think the value of process control, given the maturity of those operations, is pretty high.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks for taking my questions. Mine's a little short-term oriented, so forgive me here, but the last two earnings we've seen you and a competitor kind of talk about better NAND pretty significantly into the March quarter. I was just hoping you could give us a little more detail. It didn't sound like, from a sequential basis, you had really called that out. I don't think you gave a ton of detail. So that would make sense that we didn't see it coming there, but just maybe describe what's happening there. Is that coming from a single customer? It's coming across multiple customers. I totally understand it's a much lower base from these guys, but would love to try to figure out where the strength is coming from just on a sequential basis into March\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYes, strength and pretty low levels. It's pretty broad based. We have seen the NAND business tick up right over the course of 2024 and into 2025. We expect a little bit more improvement there. I think overall for the industry off of a very low level, there's likely to be some WFE growth there, but it's not significant. And as a percent it's bigger obviously given the level of WFE it's at presently, but would expect to see that improve a little bit moving forward, but not a lot in 2025.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nGotcha. And then on the DRAM side, clearly there's debate in the broader market. You guys called out AI in some of your prepared remarks, but it seems like there's some share jockeying that's currently taking place. It sounded more positive for the year. Your kind of view on the DRAM side, any commentary? Just when you think about six months ago when you talk to your customers, obviously people were putting in capacity for kind of all of 2025. Have you seen incremental spend there in the short term or rush orders to try to catch up by customers? Anything on that would be helpful?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nWell, I think our customers certainly set out their plans looking out for the year. So there's been no real short term change. I do think the strength in terms of what they're seeing in demand in support of the AI infrastructure continues to grow and we see momentum there.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nSo we are definitely in conversations, a lot of them about slot availability. Remember we still have many products or a few critical products that are supply constrained so we're in conversations about that. So we feel pretty good about the demand, especially at the leading edge. And the dynamics around advanced DRAM are playing to our strength because of the challenges, both the value of those devices but also the yield challenges. And as we mentioned before, the die size are smaller, less redundancy and it's looking more like higher process control intensity as we talked about.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nNext question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nYes, hi. Thanks. Just a follow up question with regard to the China impact and you've given some color on what you expect for the year from a quarterly basis. Is there any sort of incremental headwind or benefit as we go into the second half? I know that you talked about some of the mitigations and licenses, which are taking some time. But I guess how do we think about this as we go sequentially through the year?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYes, we're pretty cautious with it overall. We'll see how it plays out. As I said in the prepared remarks, in terms of licensees, that could mitigate the impact. But when we look at it over the course of the year or what we expected, it was pretty consistent across the year. So it wasn't maybe again that could be the nature to have customers buy process control versus other types of products, but it was pretty half to half was more or less pretty consistent.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nOkay, got it. Just to follow up on gross margins, again, you're kind of starting out with 62%, you're guiding to 62% for the full year. So sort of assuming that remains stable as you go through the year and I guess at what point with regard to some of the operating leverage that you typically get with the flow-through, what's kind of the starting point for that? That we could start to see some of the leverage kick in as revenue starts to grow?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah, look, you have mix issues that generally are the biggest impacting item to our overall gross margins, more so than our customers or segments. But I would expect as we start to see overall revenue accelerate, we'll start to see the kind of leverage that we've seen historically. So you know, I said 62% plus or minus about 50 basis points per quarter.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nI think some of that is predicated on what happens moving forward. We do have, depending on the mix. Right. You do have markets like the packaging market, which carries a lower gross margin given the complexity of the tools than some of our higher end systems. But obviously the gross margin dollars are quite significant and the relevancy and growth to KLA is significant. So we're pleased with that. But I think as we move forward, I think you're likely to see us continue in that 60%-65% range as we accelerate revenue over time. And as we talked about in our 2022 plan, we saw gross margins were around 63% or so, obviously predicated on a volume level about $3.5 billion. So that gives you a sense of kind of where we're at from here to there moving forward.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nI feel pretty good about our ability to achieve that given the investments we've made that are still, you know, I think we're in a good position to deliver against that. I don't think we have to go and make incremental investments in terms of the capacity, the hard asset capacity we have to execute to those business levels.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nHelpful. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nThank you. One short-term question on your March quarter guidance. You know, just the foundry logic I think you're guiding for 73% of the mix to be foundry logic that is I think implies at least in a mid-single-digit type decline.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nWe haven't seen a decline in that business in a while, and I'm just trying to understand how that reconciles with your comment about as to demand being strong in the short term.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nI'm taking a look at it. I don't think it doesn't look like it changes all that much. So I think given that the overall revenue guidance is what it was, I think for semi PC systems, I mean we'll see how the quarter ends up. And we do have business that isn't infrastructure business for example, that doesn't show up in those percentages. So when I look at the businesses that the semiconductor customers, it's pretty consistent. So I don't think it'll change a little bit. But as we talked about, I think memory overall is a higher percentage of the mix in 2025 than it was in 2024.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nOkay, got it.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nThere were some other customers non-N2, N3 that showed up in December that aren't showing up.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nOkay, okay, that makes sense. Then I guess as we go through the year, obviously N2 is going to be relatively strong. Do you still have I guess material contribution? Are you still expecting material contribution from N3 or is it at a minimal level? And then I guess just a follow up to that. How does the I guess PC intensity change as you go from N3 to N2? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah, so most of the focus in terms of new investment is on 2 nanometer. There still is some incremental investment that's happened in 3 but the vast majority of it is 2 nanometer centric.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nObviously there's packaging investment that's also happening and I mentioned it earlier. I've been over the last several couple quarters or so I've said that at N3 versus N2. At N2 we thought we were about 75 basis points higher. In terms of KLA's share of WFE, I think that we're likely higher than that. Probably 90-ish to 90-ish basis points, maybe 100 basis points. So trending in the right direction for sure.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nHi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Yeah, I was just curious. In terms of logic foundry chip makers that are at the leading edge, but maybe not expanding capacity aggressively, can you comment on the magnitude of residual spending you still see with them R and D and technology development?\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nObviously you're able to offset that for any driving there and route to outgrowing WFE this year. But just curious if you had any sort of commentary around that.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYou're saying? I'm sorry, you said one that aren't at the leading edge.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nAt the leading edge, but not expanding capacity aggressively. There's kind of, that's kind of one guy doing that. But in terms of the other ones, you're sort of on the, on the pace or maybe on the pace the net is not building out aggressively. Maybe some sense of signal spending engagement you still have with them.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nSo let's say we de-risk that in our 2025 plan.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nOkay, fair enough. And then maybe just carrying forward that last question, how about the process control intensity going from 2 nanometer gate-all-around to A16? Because I think they're kind of meant to be somewhat complicated, closely coupled to some degree.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYeah, we're a little early on that one. So I'd like to, before we start making comments, actually shifting to support that activity in a way, actually model it. And one of the things obviously we've seen over the course of the last several nodes for intensity reasons, but also for share, is that because of the design start environment limiting reuse, customers are managing a much more dynamic design environment. You now have more designs that are driving leading edge ramps. All these things have been positive factors. And then there's a share element as well. These fundamentals I think shift moving forward in the composition of semiconductor revenue to larger higher value die with defect density is very problematic. I think plays to growing opportunities for process control.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nWe have to execute on our programs to be able to deliver the right solutions for customers to solve their problems and solve the right problems of scale to production. But I think if we execute in our own business, it does create an opportunity for us to see continued tailwinds in this area. Yeah, and let me give a little more perspective too because we've actually usually, you know, if the spending is done in a node, the process control intensity is kind of set. But what we've seen happen is when we have new solutions that find new defect problems that are yield impacting, we've seen some back porting of that. So in other words, you might see some systems going into prior nodes which actually drives those intensities up in the prior node, which is the new baseline to go forward.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nSo we feel, we think part of the outperform is the fact that we actually have more solutions that solve the problems. We've always had more opportunities than we've had answers for in terms of customers trying to figure out how to learn quicker and adopt new technologies. But our technologies are really coming together in a way that we think there's, it's both share but also it drives adoption simply because we're solving more problems. So when we look at what we're seeing for N2, we feel pretty good about the potential to help our customers ramp those nodes and that'll be a basis on which to build going forward. For example, a lot of people didn't model early on the reticle verification on wafer, the print check that we're using for Gen 5, that's essentially a new application.\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nOnce people valued that, then they might even go back and backport some of that capability when there's yield opportunity. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of driving overall intensity. And that will be part of the message we share at our investor day, is how we see that going forward, which will include the node you talked about.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Good afternoon.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Senior Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. So I think you guys, I don't want to explicitly call out the direction for the second half in terms of the growth relative to the first half of the year, but it sounds like the base case assumption from you guys is you're probably going to be around that $3 billion per quarter level maybe throughout the year. Maybe some of that is contingent upon whether you can get some export licenses for that $500 billion impact from the latest export control. But is there any other swing factors that you probably don't have a conclusion yet but that could support some of the second half growth? Is there anything that you haven't mentioned?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nWell, look, licenses, as we said earlier, we haven't built that into the plan and so we'll see how that plays out. And I think now the stabilizing around current levels as we look forward. It seems like we're operating around this level and you know, as we even go beyond, you know, the middle of the year, we'll see what happens. We mentioned earlier about de-risking some opportunities and so we'll see how those potentially play out around certain customers. But that could be a swing factor as well. And I think that you know, back to what we said about, you know, certain parts of the market we've been a little bit more cautious on.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nWe'll see if there's more upside in China that I think we've tried to de-risk that relative to the levels of investment we've seen over the last couple of years. But we'll see how that plays out as we move forward. But I think we're, you know, for now it feels like around the current levels is the best that I can do from a guidance point of view.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Senior Analyst)\nThanks, Brent. Maybe a quick follow up. What's the expectation for China revenue contribution into March quarter? It will come down as a percent, being high 20s%.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nWe'll see, we'll see what ends up revenuing. Right, because you've got different revrec policy issues from whether it's a new customer and a new fab versus an established customer. So that could be either accelerate revenue to revenue shipments or extend it to an acceptance process. So we'll see how things play out. But in general, I would expect it to drop from the 35% level probably into the high 20s%, maybe 30% at the highest.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Senior Analyst)\nThanks, that's very helpful, thank you.\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nSure. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question at this time, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. We'll take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nHi, thank you for taking my question, Rick. The question on Foundry concentration comes a lot with investors. Obviously you guys are doing very well with your top foundry customer on N2 Nvidia all around and there is reference in Japan that's kind of ramping this year. How are you guys leaning into the two struggling foundries this year if that poses a risk to your business? I'm sorry, how are we dealing with, how are you guys like leaning into the two Korean foundries and what impact that could have both this year and out years in terms of your exposure?\n\n**Rick Wallace** (President and CEO)\nYou know, we're obviously work with all our customers and so if there's a way for us to add value, we're doing that. I think the bulk of the stated CapEx number pretty clearly head towards the direction of biggest player in the market in terms of investment. But the others we engage, I mean certainly everyone that we work with wants to improve their ramp up time of new technology and improve their yield and so of course we're doing that. But that's not where the bulk of the business is these days. So I don't see a huge difference in terms of how we're engaging now relative to how we were in the past. It's just the dynamics have shifted much more towards a leader who's further ahead now than they've been in quite a while.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nFair enough. And Brent, on the $500 million restrictions impact, can you give some color? Were those like trailing edge logic projects or was it a DRAM contribution in those sales?\n\n**Bren Higgins** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, most of it was logic. Yeah. Very, very little. In fact, all of it was logic. Very little. That was memory.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks.\n\n**Kevin Kessel** (VP of Investor Relations and Market Analytics)\nThank you very much and thank you everybody for your time and your attention. We know how busy today is and this week is, so we appreciate it. We'll be speaking with you all very soon. I'll turn it back in to the operator for any closing instructions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast.\n\n**Operator**\nPlease disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",
