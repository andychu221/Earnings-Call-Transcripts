At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, again, press star one. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, and this call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Kenneth Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta Platforms' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, and Susan Li, CFO. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.meta.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nAll right. Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We ended 2025 strong, with more than 3.5 billion people now using at least one of our apps every day. That includes more than 2 billion daily actives each on Facebook and WhatsApp, and just shy of that on Instagram. Our business also performed very well, thanks to record-breaking holiday demand and AI-driven performance gains. We are now seeing a major AI acceleration. I expect 2026 to be a year where this wave accelerates even further on several fronts. We're starting to see agents really work. This will unlock the ability to build completely new products and transform how we work. In 2025, we rebuilt the foundations of our AI program. Over the coming months, we're going to start shipping our new models and products.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI expect our first models will be good, but more importantly, we'll show the rapid trajectory that we're on. And then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models. I'm very excited about the products that we're building. Our vision is building personal superintelligence. We're starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content, and our relationships. A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see, and we believe that Meta will be able to provide a uniquely personal experience. We're also working on merging LLMs with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and our ad system.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nOur world-class recommendation systems are already driving meaningful growth across our apps and ads business, but we think that the current systems are primitive compared to what will be possible soon. Today, our systems help people stay in touch with friends, understand the world, and find interesting and entertaining content. But soon, we'll be able to understand people's unique personal goals and tailor feeds to show each person content that helps them improve their lives in the ways that they want. This also has implications for commerce. Our ads today help businesses find just the right, very specific people who are interested in their products. New agentic shopping tools will allow people to find just the right, very specific set of products from the businesses in our catalog.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nWe're focused on making these experiences work across both our feeds and across business messaging, significantly increasing the capabilities of WhatsApp over time. New kinds of content will soon be possible as well. People want to express themselves and experience the world in the most immersive and interactive ways possible. We started with text and then moved to photos when we got phones with cameras and then moved to video when mobile networks got fast enough. Soon, we'll see an explosion of new media formats that are more immersive and interactive and only possible because of advances in AI. Our feeds will become more interactive overall. Today, our apps feel like algorithms that recommend content. Soon, you'll open our apps, and you'll have an AI that understands you and also happens to be able to show you great content or even generate great personalized content for you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nGlasses are the ultimate incarnation of this vision. They're going to be able to see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you, and help you as you go about your day, and even show you information or generate custom UI, right there in your vision. Sales of our glasses more than tripled last year, and we think that they're some of the fastest-growing consumer electronics in history. Billions of people wear glasses or contacts for vision correction, and I think that we're at a moment similar to when smartphones arrived, and it was clearly only a matter of time until all those flip phones became smartphones. It's hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren't AI glasses.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nFor Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years. I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward while continuing to execute on our vision. As we plan for the future, we will continue to invest very significantly in infrastructure to train leading models and deliver personal superintelligence to billions of people and businesses around the world. I recently announced Meta Compute with the belief that being the most efficient at how we engineer, invest, and partner to build our infrastructure will become a strategic advantage.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nDina Powell McCormick also joined us as President and Vice Chairman, and she will lead our efforts to partner with governments, sovereigns, and strategic capital partners to expand our long-term capacity, including ensuring positive economic impact in the communities that we operate in around the world. An important part of Meta Compute will be making long-term investments in silicon and energy. We will continue working with key partners while advancing our own silicon program. We're architecting our systems that we can be flexible in the systems that we use, and we expect the cost per gigawatt to decrease significantly over time through optimizing both our technology and supply chain. The last thing that I wanna mention is that I think that 2026 is going to be the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nAs we navigate this, our North Star is building the best place for individuals to make a massive impact. So to do this, we're investing in AI-native tooling, so individuals at Meta can get more done. We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams. We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single, very talented person. I wanna make sure that as many of these very talented people as possible choose Meta as the place that they can make the greatest impact, to deliver personalized products to billions of people around the world. And if we do this, then I think that we're gonna get a lot more done, and I think it's gonna be a lot more fun. All right, that's everything I wanted to cover.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThis is gonna be a big year for delivering personal superintelligence, accelerating our business, building infrastructure for the future, and shaping how our company will work going forward. As always, I am grateful for all the hard work of our teams and to all of you for being on this journey with us. Now, here's Susan.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our segment results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.5 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in December. Q4 total Family of Apps revenue was $58.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $58.1 billion, up 24% or 23% on a constant currency basis. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 18%. Impression growth was healthy across all regions, driven primarily by engagement and user growth and, to a lesser degree, ad load optimizations.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThe average price per ad increased 6% year-over-year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Family of Apps other revenue was $801 million, up 54%, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth, as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $955 million, down 12% year-over-year. As we noted on the last call, the year-over-year decline in Reality Labs revenue is due to us lapping the introduction of Quest 3S in Q4 of 2024, as well as retail partners procuring Quest headsets during the third quarter of 2025 to prepare for the holiday season, which was recorded as revenue in Q3. Moving now to our consolidated results.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nQ4 total revenue was $59.9 billion, up 24% or 23% on a constant currency basis. Q4 total expenses were $35.1 billion, up 40% compared to last year. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by employee compensation expenses, legal expenses, and infrastructure costs. Growth in employee compensation expenses reflects the technical hires we've added this year, particularly AI talent. Legal expense growth was due to both lapping legal accrual reversals in Q4 of 2024 and charges recorded in Q4 2025. Infrastructure expense growth was driven by higher depreciation, cloud spend, and other operating expenses. We ended Q4 with over 78,800 employees, up 6% year-over-year, driven by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Meta Superintelligence Labs, as well as regulation and compliance.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nFourth quarter operating income was $24.7 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. Q4 interest and other income was $609 million, driven primarily by unrealized gains on our equity investments. Our tax rate for the quarter was 10%, slightly lower than our outlook of 12%-15% due to the settlement of matters with tax authorities. Net income was $22.8 billion or $8.88 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $22.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $14.1 billion. We ended the quarter with $81.6 billion in cash and marketable securities and $58.7 billion in debt. Turning now to the business performance.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThere are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we're continuing to drive incremental engagement from ranking and product improvements. Instagram Reels had another strong quarter, with watch time up more than 30% year-over-year in the U.S. Engagement is benefiting from several optimizations we made to improve the quality of recommendations, including simplifying our ranking architecture to enable more efficient model scaling. This unlocked the ability for our systems to consider longer interaction histories to better identify a person's interests. On Facebook, video time continued to grow double digits year-over-year in the U.S., and we're seeing strong results from our ranking and product efforts on both feed and video surfaces.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThe optimizations we made in Q4 drove a 7% lift in views of organic feed and video posts on Facebook, resulting in the largest quarterly revenue impact from Facebook product launches in the past two years. We're continuing to increase the freshness and originality of content recommendations as well. On Facebook, our systems are surfacing over 25% more Reels published that day than the prior quarter. On Instagram, we grew the prevalence of original content in the U.S. by 10 percentage points in Q4, with 75% of recommendations now coming from original posts. Threads is also seeing strong momentum, again, benefiting from recommendation improvements. The optimizations we made in Q4 drove a 20% lift in Threads time spent. Turning to 2026, we see a lot of opportunity to drive additional gains.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis includes scaling the complexity and amount of training data we use in our models, while continuing to make our systems more responsive to people's real-time interests. We're also focused on incorporating LLMs to understand content more deeply across our platform, which will enable more personalized recommendations. Another big area of investment this year is developing the next generation of our recommendation systems. We have several big bets on this front, including building new model architectures from the ground up that will work on top of LLMs, leveraging the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of an LLM to better infer people's interests. Beyond improvements to our recommendation systems, we expect to use the models developed by Meta Superintelligence Labs to deliver compelling and differentiated AI products. One area we're already seeing promise is with AI dubbing of videos into local languages.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe are now supporting nine different languages, with hundreds of millions of people watching AI-translated videos every day. This is already driving incremental time spent on Instagram, and we plan to launch support for more languages over the course of this year. We are also seeing strong traction with our media creation tools. Nearly 10% of the Reels people view each day are now created in our Edits app, almost tripling from last quarter. Within Meta AI, the number of daily actives generating media tripled year-over-year in Q4. This year, we expect to advance the capabilities of our underlying media generation models and ship new features to further enhance the product experience. Another area we're focused on for Meta AI is personalization. We're seeing in our early testing that personalized responses drive higher levels of engagement, and we expect to significantly advance the personalization of Meta AI this year.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis dovetails with our investments in content understanding, which will enable our systems to develop a deeper understanding of each person's interests and preference, preferences, while also identifying the most relevant content across our platform to pull into responses. Turning to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. Here, our focus remains on tuning our systems to identify the right time and place to deliver ads. In some cases, this enables us to grow the overall level of ad load while preserving the user experience. However, an increasingly important part of this work is finding opportunities to drive incremental conversions within the same overall level of ad load by determining when a person is more interested in seeing an ad.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn fact, in the second half of 2025, our initiatives on Facebook to redistribute ads across users and sessions delivered a nearly four times larger revenue impact than Facebook ad load increases. We also continue to make progress on bringing ads to our newer services. Within Threads, we're beginning to expand ads to all remaining countries this month, including the U.K., European Union, and Brazil. On WhatsApp, we expect to complete the rollout of ads in Status throughout the year, with the level of ads remaining low in the near term while we follow our standard approach of optimizing ad formats and performance before ramping inventory. Moving to the second part of increasing monetization efficiency, improving performance for the businesses who use our tools. We're seeing very strong results from the ad performance investments we made throughout 2025, with year-over-year conversion growth accelerating through the fourth quarter.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe expect the set of investments we're making in 2026 will enable us to drive further gains as we continue to integrate AI across all layers of the marketing and customer engagement funnel. The first area is our ad system, where we're continuing to scale the complexity and size of our models to better select which ads to show. In Q4, we doubled the number of GPUs we use to train our GEM model for ads ranking. We also adopted a new sequence learning model architecture, which is capable of using longer sequences of user behavior and processing much richer information about each piece of content. The GEM and sequence learning improvements together drove a 3.5% lift in ad clicks on Facebook, and a more than 1% gain in conversions on Instagram in Q4.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis new sequence learning architecture is significantly more efficient than our prior architectures, which should enable us to further scale up the data, complexity, and compute we use in our future ranking models to deliver performance gains. As we scale up our foundational ads models like GEM, we are also developing more advanced models to use downstream of them at runtime for ads inference. In Q4, we launched a new runtime model across Instagram Feed, Stories, and Reels, resulting in a 3% increase in conversion rates in Q4. We continue to progress on our model unification efforts under Lattice as well. After seeing strong success with the consolidation of Facebook Feed and video models in the first half of 2025, in Q4, we consolidated models for Facebook Stories and other surfaces into the overall Facebook model.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis, along with a series of back-end improvements, drove a 12% increase in ads quality. In 2026, we expect to consolidate more models than we had in the prior two years as we continue to evolve our systems towards running a smaller number of highly capable models. Moving to the next area, ads products. We continue investing in ways to help businesses leverage AI to reduce the friction of setting up and optimizing an ad campaign. In Q4, we started testing our Meta AI business assistant with advertisers, which helps with tasks like campaign optimization and account support. In the coming months, we'll make it available to more advertisers, so each business has an AI assistant they can chat with that remembers their business's goals and provides personalized recommendations on how to improve performance. Another area we're deploying AI to improve performance is ad creative.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThe combined revenue run rate of video generation tools hit $10 billion in Q4, with quarter-over-quarter growth outpacing the increase in overall ads revenue by nearly three times. We are also seeing very good results from our incremental attribution feature, which optimizes for incremental conversions in real time. Our latest model rollout in Q4 is driving a 24% increase in incremental conversions versus our standard attribution model, and this product has already achieved a multi-billion dollar annual run rate just seven months since launching. The last area of our monetization work I'll cover is business messaging, where we're seeing strong momentum across our portfolio of solutions.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nClick-to-Message ads revenue growth accelerated in Q4, with the U.S. up more than 50% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of our website-to-message ads, which direct people to a business's website for more information before choosing to launch a chat. Paid messaging within WhatsApp continues to scale as well, crossing a $2 billion annual run rate in Q4. Finally, we're seeing good early traction with our business AIs in Mexico and the Philippines, with over one million weekly conversations between people and business AIs now happening on our messaging platforms. This year, we will expand availability of our business AIs to more markets, while also extending their capabilities, so they not only answer questions on topics like product availability, but can help people get things done right within WhatsApp.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe speak a lot about how AI is improving our products, but I'd like to take a moment to give an update on how it's changing the way we work. Mark mentioned our focus on making Meta a place where individuals can have significant impact. A big focus of this is to enable the adoption and advancement of our AI coding tools, where we're seeing strong momentum. Since the beginning of 2025, we've seen a 30% increase in output per engineer, with the majority of that growth coming from the adoption of agentic coding, which saw a big jump in Q4. We're seeing even stronger gains with power users of AI coding tools, whose output has increased 80% year-over-year. We expect this growth to accelerate through the next half. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe have significant opportunities to improve our core business in 2026. We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities, while also positioning us for an entirely new and exciting product cycle over the coming years, powered by our AI models. Procuring sufficient infrastructure capacity is central to these initiatives, and we're working to meet our silicon needs by deploying a variety of chips that optimally support each of our different workloads. To that end, in Q4, we extended our Andromeda ads retrieval engine, so it can now run on NVIDIA, AMD, and MTIA. This, along with model innovations, enabled us to nearly triple Andromeda's compute efficiency. In Q1, we will extend our MTIA program to support our core ranking and recommendation training workloads, in addition to the inference workloads it currently runs.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nMore broadly, as we invest in infrastructure to meet our business needs, we continue to prioritize maintaining long-term flexibility, so we can adapt to how the market develops. We're doing so in several ways, including changing how we develop data center sites, establishing strategic partnerships, contracting cloud capacity, and establishing new ownership structures for some of our large data center sites. We have a strong net cash balance and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026, which is reflected in our expectations. Nonetheless, we will continue to look for opportunities to periodically supplement our strong operating cash flow with prudent amounts of cost-efficient external financing, which may lead us to eventually maintain a positive net debt balance.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nMoving to our financial outlook, we expect our first quarter 2026 total revenue to be in the range of $53.5 billion-$56.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 4% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning to the expense and CapEx outlooks, we expect full year 2026 total expenses to be in the range of $162 billion-$169 billion. The majority of expense growth will be driven by infrastructure costs, which includes third-party cloud spend, higher depreciation, and higher infrastructure operating expenses. The second-largest contributor to total expense growth is employee compensation, driven by investments in technical talent. This includes 2026 hires to support our priority areas, particularly AI, as well as a full year of expenses from 2025 hires.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAt a segment level, we expect expense growth to be driven by the Family of Apps, with Reality Labs' operating losses remaining similar to 2025 levels. We anticipate 2026 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $115 billion-$135 billion, with year-over-year growth driven by increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business. Despite the meaningful step up in infrastructure investment, in 2026, we expect to deliver operating income that is above 2025 operating income. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2026 tax rate to be 13%-16%. Finally, we recently aligned with the European Commission on further changes to our less personalized ads offering, which we will begin rolling out this quarter.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nHowever, we continue to monitor legal and regulatory headwinds in the E.U. and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and financial results. For example, we continue to see scrutiny on youth-related issues and have a number of trials scheduled for this year in the U.S., which may ultimately result in a material loss. In closing, 2025 was another strong year for our company. The investments we've made to improve our business are continuing to drive strong growth, and we have an exciting roadmap this year to deliver new experiences and services for our global community. As always, thank you to our teams for their hard work and commitment to our mission. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. To ask a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, again, press star one. Please limit yourself to one question. Please pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are streaming today's call, please mute your computer speakers. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n**Brian Nowak** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my questions. I've one for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, one is a long-term question. As you think about ramping all this investment and the personal intelligence opportunity, the Meta Compute opportunity, can you walk us through a little bit how you think about the largest revenue or ROIC long-term opportunities you're trying to unlock with those over the next, call it three, five, 10 years through all the investment? And then, Susan, a little more near term, more like 2026. I think the guide is the fastest growth you've had in almost five years.\n\n**Brian Nowak** (Managing Director)\nI know you have a lot of improvements on recommendations and in monetization efficiency, but can you just sort of help us a little bit understand two or three of the biggest drivers of this inflection you're seeing on revenue in 2026?\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nYeah, I guess I can start with the first one. Although I have to say up front that I think my answers to a lot of your questions on this particular call may be somewhat unfulfilling because we're in this interesting period where we've been rebuilding our AI effort, and we're six months into that, and I'm happy with how it's going. But we are going to be rolling out our initial set of models and products and businesses around that over the coming months, and I will have a lot more to share on all of those fronts at that point.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nSo I'm happy to offer kind of a high-level view of some of the stuff, but, but I apologize in advance that not much of this is going to be particularly detailed, but it will be exciting as we roll it out. I think the theme on the business, I mean, this is... I don't think I'm going to break any new ground here, but you know, there are several major business opportunities that we're focused on. You know, I think that one is just going to be improving the core products and accelerating the core, the current business. I talked about that in terms of the connecting of the recommendation systems and the LLMs, which I think will both improve the quality of the organic experience and of advertising.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nWe're going to see the generation of media improve the quality of content, which, coupled with the improvements in the recommendation systems, we expect to generally accelerate the quality and effectiveness of the core business, both for people who use it organically and for businesses. So I think that will have a compounding effect. And then, there's gonna be, you know, several many, I think, new business opportunities that come up. I mean, we have been working on Meta AI for a while. I think you're starting to see some of the way that products like that get monetized across the industry. When we get that to a scale and depth that we want, we think that there are gonna be opportunities both in terms of subscriptions and advertising and all of the different things that you see on that.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI mean, yeah, I think, you know, there's a number of things on shopping and commerce that I'm quite excited about that I alluded to in the comments up front. And as the models launch and we demonstrate some of the capabilities, both in the first set of models and over the year, I think the models are gonna get a lot better too. We'll be able to have different products paired with those that I think will facilitate different businesses for, you know, businesses who use us and our platforms, as well as direct-to-consumer businesses. I guess it's probably also worth flagging because I don't think we, either of us, mentioned the Manus acquisition in the upfront comments.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think that is going to be a good example of a significant number of businesses that already pay a subscription to basically use their tool to accelerate their business results. Integrating that kind of thing into our Ads and Business Manager, so that way we can just offer more integrated solutions for the, you know, many, many millions of businesses that use and rely on our platforms, is gonna be really powerful, both for accelerating their results using the existing products that we have, and I think adding new lines as well. You know, a somewhat high-level answer, and I think the picture will become clearer and I think more exciting if we do our jobs well over the course of the year.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nBrian, on your second question, there's obviously a range of outcomes captured in the Q1 2026 revenue outlook. It overall reflects our expectation for a strong quarter of growth. The range embeds an outlook for accelerated growth, and that's really underpinned by the strong demand that we saw through the end of Q4 and continuing into the start of 2026. Now, I will say we also expect foreign currency to be a 4-point benefit to year-over-year growth, so that is a three-point larger tailwind than it was in Q4 2025, as we lap the strengthening of the U.S. dollar a year ago. But overall, you know, we see that advertisers are responding to ad performance improvements that we made. They're driving strong conversion growth.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe've made a lot of these investments over the course of 2025, including advances to our ads ranking and delivery systems, the more effective redistribution of ad load, new features and ad products like Advantage+, better measurement, and just a lot of great work that has helped to drive the continued performance of our ads.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Eric Sheridan** (Managing Director)\nThanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two, if I could. In prior periods, you've talked about being capacity constrained internally and not having enough compute to sort of achieve the goals you have on a platform and a product standpoint. I wanna know if we get any update on currently how you think about your own internal needs for compute against that roadmap. And the second part of the question would be: as we continue to see the ads business sorta scale, especially in terms of dollar growth year-over-year, have we yet seen the full first order effects of scaling the business against applying more compute to it? Or how should investors think about the directional relationship between applying more compute and rate of change in terms of outcomes on the monetization side? Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOn your first question, we do continue to be capacity constrained. Our teams have done a great job ramping up our infrastructure through the course of 2025, but demands for compute resources across the company have increased even faster than our supply. So we expect over the course of 2026 to have significantly more capacity this year as we add cloud. But we'll likely still be constrained through much of 2026 until additional capacity from our own facilities comes online later in the year. With that said, I think, you know, we have done a good job internally mitigating the impact of compute constraints on our business. I expect that will continue to be the case in 2026.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe're continuing to focus on increasing our infrastructure efficiency in several ways, including by optimizing workloads, improving infrastructure utilization, diversifying our chip supply, and just investing in efficiency improvements as part of our core technology development efforts in areas like content and ads ranking. So that was your first question. The second question about how the ads business scales. I think I don't have an extremely precise answer to this question. What I'd say is, you know, one of the ways that we are working to drive ads performance improvements is by improving our larger scale models, along with our lighter weight ones that we use for ads inference at runtime. You know, we don't typically use our larger model architectures, like GEM for inference because their size and complexity would make it too cost prohibitive.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nSo the way that we drive performance from those models is by using them to transfer knowledge to smaller, lightweight models used at runtime. But I would say that we think that there is room for our larger models to benefit from having more compute. And I think as we scale up the compute available to those models, and the foundational models in different areas that power the different stages of ads ranking and recommendation, you know, we expect that we will see gains coming from that.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mark Shmulik** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Internet)\nYes, thanks for taking the questions, too, if I may. Mark, kind of with your comments that you kind of expect to see some meaningful changes in how work and things are done this year, I guess, would you be surprised if kind of by the end of the year, we've yet to see meaningful progress and adoption on some of the newer products and initiatives that you're launching? Or, you know, should we just be a bit more patient on the timeline here? And then, Susan, kind of with the guidance provided on OI still expected to grow kind of faster this year than last year, you know, let's say in a few months, we realize we need more investment and resources to continue to go after the AI opportunity, but perhaps macro might be a bit weaker.\n\n**Mark Shmulik** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Internet)\nHow hard of a line is there in terms of the tie of investment levels to core performance? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think the first question was asking about kind of when do I expect the product impact to be? I mean, we're going to roll out new products over the course of the year. I think the important thing is we're not just launching one thing and we're building a lot of things. I think there—like, AI is going to enable a lot of new experiences. I outlined thematically a bunch of these in the upfront comments around, you know, a personal AI, around, LLMs combining with the recommendation systems. I think that's a somewhat longer-term research project that I think will yield dividends over a long period of time, but we're already definitely seeing optimizations of the recommendation systems as we're including more of the AI research improvements and advances into that. The content is going to improve.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThere are going to be new formats. There are going to be improvements on the glasses. There are all these different things, as well as several new things that we think are new, that we're going to try that are not just extensions of the current things that we're doing. Yeah, I mean, I would expect that we'll roll these out over the course of the year and that you know, sometimes it takes a few iterations for things to really hit and reach the kind of product market fit that you need.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nBut I think we have enough time, hopefully, to, you know, in the-- we're starting off early enough in the year, that I would expect that we'll see some successes by the end of the year on this, as well as on the work side. What we were talking about is I think it's very hard for anyone exactly to predict what the shape of, you know, how organizations working is going to feel. But it... I just think the fact that agents are really starting to work now is quite profound, and I think is going to allow-- we're already starting to see the people who adopt them are just being significantly more productive.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThere's a big delta between the people who do it and do it well, and the people who don't. I think that's going to just be a very profound dynamic for, I think, across the whole sector and probably the whole economy going forward in terms of the productivity and efficiency with which we can run these companies, which I think, you know, my hope is that we can use that to just get a lot more done than we were able to before. I'm most focused on making sure that Meta is a great company to have a big impact, right?\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nYou'll be able to use these kind of agentic tools anywhere, but you will only be able to come and ship things to billions of people if you join a company like Meta, and there aren't that many companies like Meta. So, I think if we make it so that we can harness these kind of tools, then I think that we should, over some period of time, start to see a real acceleration in the amount of output that we could have. Now, how to predict exactly the time frame for adopting that, somewhat hard, right? I'm not going to predict a specific quarter or something like that, but the trend seems like unmistakably like this is going to happen.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nAnd that, to me, is something that is very exciting and, like I said in my comments up front, also, like, honestly, kind of fun, right? I think it just makes it more fun to be able to build a lot of things. And, you know, that's what we're here to do.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nMark, on your second question, I want to make sure and clarify something. So I think in the question, you had said that operating income growth in 2026 would be higher than 2025, and I want to make sure my comments were super clear. In 2026, we expect to deliver operating income above 2025 operating income. So this is comparing absolute dollars, not year-over-year growth. So to give some context on that, you know, we are going into 2026 with strong revenue growth at the start. Of course, we are just a few weeks in, set against, you know, a healthy macro backdrop, so obviously hard to extrapolate the current trends to the full year and, you know, there are many, many moving variables in the current landscape.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe're really taking advantage of the current business strength to reinvest a lot of the revenue into what we see as very attractive investment opportunities in AI infrastructure and talent. It's hard to assess, you know, what all of those investment opportunities will be over the course of the year as we continue to work through our capacity options. And of course, it remains a very competitive hiring market, but we'd like to invest aggressively where we can. We continue to use our framework that we shared at this point, several years ago, of growing consolidated operating profit over time to guide those investments. Based on where our plans are rolling up today, again, in 2026, we expect to deliver more operating income than we did in 2025.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Doug Anmuth** (Head of U.S. Internet Equity Research)\nThanks so much for taking the questions. One for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, could you just provide more detail on the progress of the MSL team several months in, and more on your view on the path to a frontier model this year? And then, Susan, I know you expect to grow operating income in 2026. Do you also expect to have positive free cash flow? Just how should we think about the current and any future, JVs for data center and compute build-out? Thanks.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\n... I'm not sure I have anything else to add on the current progress on this. I mean, that's why I said up front that I think this is somewhat of an unfulfilling time to be answering some of these questions. We're about six months in to building MSL. I'm very pleased with the quality of the team. I think we have the most talent-dense research effort in the industry, and some of the early indicators look positive. But look, I think that this is gonna—this is a long-term effort, right? We're not here to do this to ship, like, one model or one product. We're doing a lot of models over time and a lot of different products.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nAnd I wanna make sure that the work can speak for itself, and also that you know we all internalize that this is a journey that we're on, and the first set of things that we put out, I think, are gonna be more about showing the trajectory that we're on, rather than being a single moment in time. So, yeah, I'm quite optimistic, but don't have anything else, you know, particularly concrete to share.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nDoug, on the first part of your question, you know, we are making very significant investments in infrastructure capacity this year to support our AI efforts, and we believe we're in a strong position to support them with the cash generation of our business this year. And, you know, at the same time, we'll continue to explore different paths, as we build out our infrastructure capacity that help us provide, you know, that help provide us the long-term flexibility and option value that we look for as we support our future capacity needs against the backdrop of a very wide range of possible capacity demand over the years to come. So we don't have anything additional to announce at this point.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nYou know, we are looking at, you know, all of the different opportunities to stand up capacity across kind of the different time frames that we need them.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\n**Justin Post** (Managing Director)\nGreat. A couple, maybe one for Mark and one for Susan. It just seems like you're gonna have a tremendous amount of capacity. How do you think about expanding your opportunities beyond ads? Things like subscriptions or licensing cloud models, just with all the interesting things you're building. I don't expect any product announcements, but can you do things beyond ads? And then for Susan, it's really interesting to see the acceleration, even ex-FX and advertising. I'm just wondering if you're seeing a general acceleration in e-commerce activity. Where do you think the dollars are coming from, and is the entire internet ecosystem accelerating? I'm just wondering your thoughts on that.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nSo yes, we are focused on things beyond ads. I think the numbers make it so that for the next couple of years, ads are going to be by far the most important driver of growth in our business. So that's why as we're working on this, we have a balance of new things that we're trying to do, while also investing very heavily in making sure that all of the work that we're doing in AI improves both the quality and business performance of the core apps and businesses that we run there.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nYeah, I mean, we'll have more to share on that, but I mean, all these things, even if they scale very quickly, are going to take, you know, some time to be meaningful at the scale of what the ads business is. And while we're doing that, we're just very focused on also delivering more value to businesses and more quality in the apps that we run ads in.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nJustin, on your second question, we saw healthy year-over-year growth across all verticals in Q4, with the exception of politics as we lapped the U.S. presidential election last year. The online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. That was followed by professional services and technology. So in online commerce, year-over-year growth was strong. It was actually relatively consistent with Q3 levels, and that was broad-based across advertiser regions and sizes. In general, we saw that the demand leading up to the holiday shopping period that sustained through Cyber Five and into the end of the year, you know, was very healthy for us.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nProfessional services, in this category, we saw strong, broad-based growth with nice contributions from lead generation ads due to product improvements we've made, including from Advantage+ lead campaigns that we fully rolled out at the start of Q4. And, you know, the tech vertical continues to be strong for us, too. Again, broad-based across advertiser regions and sizes. So in general, I would say it was very healthy, broadly driven growth.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ross Sandler** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Mark, you mentioned bringing Horizon Worlds into mobile. We haven't heard much from the Horizon Worlds squad on these calls, so interesting that that's making it in. It seems like the combo of AI and what you guys have built with Horizon might open up the door to a bunch of new potential areas in gaming or, you know, new forms of kind of communication. So could you just elaborate on what the plan is there? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nYeah. So let me talk about the basic theme here. You know, one core idea that I've talked about on some of these calls over the years is that people always want to express themselves and experience the world in whatever the richest format is that they can. So I talked about this upfront today. It's when we started, a lot of this was text, right? That was the kind of the best we could do. Then we all got phones. They had cameras. Like, a lot of this medium became visual, but with photos. We went through a period where the mobile networks were kind of weak, and every time you wanted to watch a video, it would buffer. And once that got worked out, now the majority of the content is video. And one of the core ideas that-...\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nWe have had for a while, is that that is not the end of the line. All right, video will continue to be here for a long time. It's going to continue growing. It's not going anywhere, just like photos and text, in many ways, continue to grow even as the market continues to grow beyond that. But I don't think that video is the ultimate kind of final format. I just think that this is gonna get we're gonna get more formats that are more interactive and immersive, and you're gonna get them in your feeds.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nSo you can imagine this, I mean, there's obviously a lot of details to fill in on this, but you can imagine, you know, being able to, people being able to easily, through a prompt, create a world or create a game and, be able to share that with people who they care about, and you see it in your feed, and you can jump right into it, and you can engage in it. And there are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that, and Horizon, I think, fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that. But there's definitely a version of the future where, you know, any video that you see, you can, like, tap on and jump into it and, like, engage and, like, and be, be kind of like experience it in a, in a more meaningful way.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think that the investments that we've done in both a lot of the virtual reality software and Horizon, as well as a number of other areas around the company, are actually going to pair well with these AI advances to be able to bring some of those experiences to hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile. So anyway, that's the thing that I'm quite excited about, but it's, it's just sort of one flavor of a, of a theme that I think is going to be very interesting. I think there are going to be lots of different types of interactive and immersive content that become possible. I think Horizon is going to be one very interesting example that, that I'm quite excited to see how this unfolds.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ron Josey** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to drill down, maybe, Susan, on your comments around ranking recommendation model changes. You know, clearly, lots of tailwinds here, given the results from GEMs, Andromeda, Lattice, consolidation of models, et cetera. So can you help us understand a little bit more just about the roadmap and where we stand within ranking recommendation model changes? There, there's a thesis out there that maybe we're, you know, there's a limiting factor, or maybe we're waiting on newer models, but any insights there would be very helpful as we think about the next, as the future going forward. Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nYeah, thanks for the question, Ron. I'm just sorting out if your question was more specific to ads or if it was more specific to kind of the engagement side, but I'll try to talk a little bit about both. So on the sort of core engagement piece, you know, we launched several ranking improvements in Q4 on Facebook and Instagram that drove incremental engagement, and there isn't really one single launch, you know, that is driving most of the gains. It's, you know, multiple optimizations to our recommendation systems that are helping us make more accurate predictions about what will be interesting to each person. And, you know, I talked a little bit about some of these, the specific instantiations on both Facebook and on Instagram.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe see, you know, a lot of headroom to improve recommendations in 2026, which we expect will drive additional engagement growth on both apps. First, we plan on to continue scaling up our models and increase the amount of data we use, including a longer history of content interactions, to further improve the overall quality of recommendations. We're also going to start validating the use of ad signals and organic content recommendations as we continue to work towards having a more shared platform for organic and ads recommendations over time. Second, we're gonna continue to make recommendations even more adaptive to what a person is engaging with during their session, so the recommendations we surface are more relevant to what they're interested in at that moment.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nFinally, we will work on more deeply incorporating LLMs into our existing recommendation systems, given their capability to more deeply understand content. And so this will, I think, in particular, be useful for content that has been more recently posted since there's less engagement data to base recommendations off of. On the ad side, again, we've talked about a lot of the sort of model work in the ads world across Andromeda and Lattice and GEM. I'll touch maybe specifically, you know, on GEM in Q4. We extended GEM to cover Facebook Reels. Now it covers all major surfaces across Facebook and Instagram. We also doubled the size of the GPU cluster we use to train it.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn 2026, we're expecting to meaningfully scale up GEM training to an even larger cluster, increasing the complexity of the model, expanding the data that we train it on, leveraging new sequence learning architecture that we had begun deploying in Q4. And we're also going to further improve how we transfer the learnings from our GEM foundation models to the runtime models that we're using. So, you know, there's a lot more headroom, I think, across many, many components of the stack. This is the first time we have found a recommendation model architecture that can scale with similar efficiency as LLMs, and, you know, we're hoping that this will unlock the ability for us to significantly scale up the size of our ranking models, you know, while preserving an attractive ROI.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question will come from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ken Gawrelski** (Managing Director and Senior Internet Analyst)\nThank you very much. Two, if I may, please. First, for Mark, how critical is it for Meta to have a leading general-purpose model, or is there a sufficient capability in a model that really excels at specific use cases, maybe similar to what you see at Anthropic in coding today? If you could opine on that. And then second, maybe, I just want to push again, maybe on this last question, Susan.\n\n**Ken Gawrelski** (Managing Director and Senior Internet Analyst)\n... on the, the visibility you have, you talked about the improvements you're making in 2026 on the, on the models, the fine-tuning, of the core, both in engagement and, and ad relevance. Could you talk about, are you seeing any signs of diminishing returns to those investments? And, and do you think, do you have visibility beyond 2026 into, further opportunities there? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI, I think the question was around how important is it for us to have a general model? You know, the way that I think about Meta is we're a, like, a deep technology company. Some people think about us as we build these apps and experiences, but the thing that allows us to build all these things is that we build and control the underlying technology that allows us to integrate and design the experiences that we want, and not just be constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build. So, I, I think that this is a, a really fundamental thing, where my guess is that frontier AI, for many reasons, some competitive, some safety-oriented, are not going to always be available through an API to everyone.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nSo I think, like, it's very important, I think, to be able to have the capability to build the experiences that you want if you wanna to, to be one of the major companies in the world that helps to shape the future of these products. So that, that I think is... It's going to be, I think, important from a business perspective, and I think it's just important from, like, a creative and mission perspective, to be able to actually design and build the experiences that we believe that we should be building for people. But yeah, I mean, I think it's quite important, otherwise we wouldn't be so focused on this, where we're clearly extremely focused on this.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nYou know, interestingly, a year ago on this call, I think I talked about the set of investments we were making in 2025, as part of our 2025 budgeting process across our ads performance and organic engagement initiatives. You know, and those, those investments have generally paid off, and we, you know, feel really good about, about kind of the, the process we ran in terms of using projected ROI to stack rank investments. Make sure that we, you know, had a robust measurement system, funded things that were positive ROI, and then tracking how they performed over the course of the year.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAnd we are, you know, we've just finished running our 2026 budgeting process, and we have funded a similar set of investments, which we expect will enable us to continue delivering strong revenue growth in 2026. Having said that, you know, I expect both full year reported and constant currency revenue growth to be below the levels in Q1, for a few reasons. First, we would expect that currency tailwinds will dissipate later in the year based on current rates. Second, we'll be lapping stronger periods of growth later in the year that benefited from our 2025 ad performance investments and the strong macro landscape. And finally, we expect there could be some headwinds from our introduction of the revised, less personalized ads offering in the EU that begins rolling out later in Q1.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nBut again, similar to 2025, we feel good about the process by which we identified investment opportunities with attractive ROIs and funded them as part of our budget, to support, you know, key initiatives across our ranking and recommendation systems, and to increase the capacity efficiency of our models, all of which are key to sort of driving, to driving growth for us.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mark Mahaney** (Senior Managing Director)\nOkay, two questions, please. Meta AI, any update on what you're seeing there in terms of engagement and usage? And do you think you're just starting to be able to apply improvements to that specific functionality? And then just real quickly on share repurchases, Susan, I don't think you bought any stock back in the quarter. It's been a while, maybe a year, since you haven't bought anything back. You talked about capital allocation a little bit into the year. It didn't sound like you're gonna be buying back stock anytime soon, but just do you want to clarify that? Thanks a lot.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nYes, I'm happy to take both of those. So, Meta AI, the quick update there is, you know, it's now available in over 200 markets. The largest daily active user markets for Meta AI align with where our apps are also very popular. Though the apps people engage most with Meta AI differ, in some places, you know, it's primarily WhatsApp driven, for example, India or Indonesia. In the U.S., Facebook is a stronger driver of engagement. And in general, we see a lot of opportunity to make it easier for people to accomplish the tasks that they already come to our services for every day, and if we do that well, then the way people use our products will continue to expand.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe're focused on making Meta AI the most personalized assistant, while tapping into the vast amount of, you know, information, trends, content from our platform, to offer differentiated insights. We think we have a very strong track record in building highly personalized experiences, and we're bringing that into Meta AI so that we can tailor responses to each person's personal interests and preferences. On your second question, which is about share repurchases, you know, share repurchase levels will vary from time to time, for a lot of reasons, including whether we believe there are areas that have a greater near-term need for capital. Right now, we think the highest order priority for the company is investing our resources to position ourselves as a leader in AI.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAnd so that is really that's kind of the first order use of capital, but we'll continue to be opportunistic and evaluate repurchases versus other uses of cash.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nGreat! I think we will wrap it here. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.\n\n**Operator**\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, again press star one. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, and this call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Kenneth Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platforms' Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, and Susan Li, CFO. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.appmeta.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nAll right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another strong quarter with 3.5 billion people using at least one of our apps every day. Instagram hit a major milestone with 3 billion monthly actives, and we're seeing good momentum across our other apps as well, including Threads, which recently passed 150 million daily actives and remains on track to become the leader in its category. I am very focused on establishing Meta as the leading frontier AI lab, building personal superintelligence for everyone, and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our approach of advancing open-source AI means that when Meta innovates, everyone benefits. Meta's Superintelligence Lab is off to a strong start. I think that we've already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nWe're heads down developing our next generation of models and products, and I'm looking forward to sharing more on that front over the coming months. We're also building what we expect to be an industry-leading amount of compute. Now, there's a range of timelines for when people think that we're going to get superintelligence. Some people think that we'll get there in a few years. Others think it will be five, seven years, or longer. I think that it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load building capacity so that way we're prepared for the most optimistic cases. That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift and many large opportunities.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nIf it takes longer, then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business, which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to throw at it. We're seeing very high demand for additional compute, both internally and externally. In the worst case, we would just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build. The upside is extremely high for both our existing apps and new products and businesses that are becoming possible to build. Across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, our AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content, which led to 5% more time spent on Facebook in Q3 and 10% on Threads. Video is a particular bright spot, with video time spent on Instagram up more than 30% since last year.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nAs video continues to grow across our apps, Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion. Improvements in our recommendation systems will also become even more leveraged as the volume of AI-created content grows. Social media has gone through two eras so far. The first was when all content was from friends, family, and accounts that you followed directly. The second was when we added all of the creator content. Now, as AI makes it easier to create and remix content, we're going to add yet another huge corpus of content on top of those. Recommendation systems that understand all this content more deeply and can show you the right content to help you achieve your goals are going to be increasingly valuable. Our ads business continues to perform very well, largely due to improvements in our AI ranking systems as well.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThis quarter, we saw meaningful advances from unifying different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency. Now, the annual run rate going through our completely end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. One way that I think about our company overall is that there are three giant transformers that run Facebook, Instagram, and ads recommendations. We have a very strong pipeline of lots of ways to improve these models by incorporating new AI advances and capabilities. At the same time, we are also working on combining these three major AI systems into a single unified AI system that will effectively run our family of apps and business, using increasing intelligence to improve the trillions of recommendations that we'll make for people every day. I'm also very excited about the new products that we're going to be able to build.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nMore than a billion monthly actives already use Meta AI, and we see usage increase as we improve our underlying models. I'm very excited to get a frontier model into Meta AI, and I think that the opportunity there is very large. The same goes for our business AI. Every day, people have more than 1 billion active threads with business accounts across our messaging platforms, ranging from product questions to customer support. Our business AIs will enable tens of millions of businesses to scale these conversations and improve their sales at low cost. The better our models get, the better this is going to work for all businesses. This quarter, we also launched Vibes, which is the next generation of our AI creation tools and content experiences. Retention is looking good so far, and its usage keeps growing quickly week over week.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI'm looking forward to ramping up the growth of Vibes over the coming months. More broadly, I think that Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead as well. As our new models become ready, I'm looking forward to starting to show everyone some of the new kinds of products that we're working on. At Connect, we announced our 2025 line of AI glasses, and the response so far has been great. The new Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta Vanguards are both selling well, as people love the improved battery life, camera resolution, new AI capabilities, and the great design. There is our new Meta Ray-Ban display glasses, our first glasses with a high-resolution display and the Meta Neural Band to interact with them.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThey sold out in almost every store within 48 hours, with demo slots fully booked through the end of next month. We are going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those. This is an area where we are clearly leading and have a huge opportunity ahead. Taking a step back, if we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead for our existing apps and the new experiences that are possible, then I think that the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history. We've got a lot to do, but we're making real progress, delivering strong business results, building the talent density and infrastructure needed for the next era, and leading the way on AI devices that will define the next computing platform.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI'm proud of how our teams are rising to the challenge, and I'm grateful for their dedication, hard work, and creativity. As always, thank you all for being a part of this journey with us. Now, here's Susan.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our segment results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Our community across the family of apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.5 billion people used at least one of our family of apps on a daily basis in September. Q3 total family of apps revenue was $50.8 billion, up 26% year over year. Q3 family of apps ad revenue was $50.1 billion, up 26%, or 25% on a constant currency basis. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 14%. Impression growth was healthy across all regions, driven by engagement and user growth, particularly on video services. The average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and services. Family of apps other revenue was $690 million, up 59%, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth, as well as Meta verified subscriptions. Within our reality lab segment, Q3 revenue was $470 million, up 74% year over year. The significant year-over-year growth in Q3 was partly due to retail partners stocking up on Quest headsets ahead of the holiday season. We did not have a similar benefit in the third quarter of last year since our Quest 3S headset launched in the fourth quarter of 2024. Aside from this, strong AI glasses revenue also contributed to revenue growth in Q3. Moving now to our consolidated results. Q3 total revenue was $51.2 billion, up 26% or 25% on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $30.7 billion, up 32% compared to last year.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nYear-over-year expense growth accelerated 20 percentage points from Q2, due primarily to three factors. First, legal-related expense growth was higher than in Q2 due to charges we recorded in the third quarter, as well as us lapping a period of accrual reversals in the third quarter a year ago. Second, employee compensation growth accelerated, driven by technical hires, particularly AI talent. Finally, growth in infrastructure costs accelerated due to increased infrastructure operating costs associated with our expanded data center fleet, depreciation on our incremental CapEx spend, and third-party cloud spend. We ended Q3 with over 78,400 employees, up 8% year over year, driven by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Meta Superintelligence Labs, as well as regulation and compliance. Third quarter operating income was $20.5 billion, representing a 40% operating margin.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nQ3 interest and other income was $1.1 billion, driven primarily by unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities. Our tax rate for the quarter was 87%, which was unfavorably impacted by a one-time non-cash reduction in deferred tax assets that we no longer anticipate using under new U.S. tax law. Our tax rate would have been 14% excluding this charge. Although the transition to the new U.S. tax law resulted in an accounting charge in the third quarter, we continue to expect we will recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of the current year and future years under the new law, and this quarter's charge reflects the total expected impact from the transition to the new U.S. tax law. Net income was $2.7 billion, or $1.05 per share. Excluding the one-time tax charge, our net income and EPS would have been $18.6 billion and $7.25 per share, respectively.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $19.4 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.6 billion. We repurchased $3.2 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $44.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. Turning now to the business outlook, there are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, daily actives continue to grow year over year across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. We're continuing to see improvements to our products and recommendations drive incremental engagement, with year-over-year growth in global time spent accelerating on both Facebook and Instagram in Q3.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn the U.S., overall time spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits year over year, driven by continued video strength as well as healthy growth in non-video time on Facebook. The engagement gains continue to be driven by product work and ongoing improvements to our recommendation systems as we optimize our model architectures, implement advanced modeling techniques, and integrate more signals about people's interests. We also continue to focus on increasing the freshness of recommended content. On Facebook, our systems are now surfacing twice as many Reels published that day than at the start of the year. Looking to 2026, we expect to advance our recommendation systems across several dimensions. On Instagram, one focus is evolving our systems to surface content across a broader set of topics that cater to the diverse interests of each person.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis follows a similar approach we've implemented on Facebook that has driven good results. We also expect to make significant progress on our longer-term ranking innovations in 2026. We're seeing promising new results from our research efforts to create foundational ranking models and expect the new model innovations we're developing as part of this will enable us to significantly scale up the amount of data and compute we use to train our recommendation models in 2026, yielding more relevant recommendations. Another large focus next year is leveraging LLMs to improve content understanding. We expect this is going to enable our systems to more precisely label the keywords and topics within videos and posts, which will allow our systems to both develop deeper intuition about a person's interests and retrieve the content that matches them. Finally, we're making good progress with Meta AI and Threads.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThe number of people using Meta AI across our family of apps continues to grow, and we're increasingly leveraging first-party content into Meta AI results, with the majority of Meta AI's responses to Facebook deep dive queries in the U.S. now showing related Reels. We're also seeing a lot of traction with media generation. People have created over 20 billion images using our products, and since launching Vibes within Meta AI in September, we've seen media generation in the app increase more than tenfold. On Threads, we see strong growth in both daily actives and the depth of engagement as we continue to improve recommendations. The ranking optimizations we made in Q3 alone drove a 10% increase in time spent on Threads. We also continue to ship new features, including launching direct messaging in Q3, so anyone on Threads can now message one another within the app.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to refine ad supply across each of our major services within Facebook and Instagram to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. Longer term, we have exciting ad supply opportunities on both Threads and WhatsApp status. Ads are now running globally in feed on Threads, and we're following our typical monetization playbook of optimizing the ads formats and performance before we ramp supply. Within WhatsApp status, we're continuing to gradually introduce ads and expect to complete the rollout next year. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAdvancing our ad systems remains a critical aspect of this work, and we are driving performance gains through ongoing improvements in our larger-scale ads ranking models. For example, we continue to broaden the adoption of Lattice, our unified model architecture. In Q3, we rolled out Lattice to app ads, which drove a nearly 3% gain in conversions for that objective. Since introducing Lattice back in 2023, along with other backend improvements, we have now cut the number of ads ranking and recommendation models by approximately 100, as we consolidated smaller and more specialized models into larger ones that use the Lattice architecture to generalize learnings across surfaces and objectives. We continue to observe performance improvements as we combine models and expect to drive additional gains as we consolidate another 200 models over the coming years into a smaller number of highly capable models.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn addition to advancing our foundational ads models, we're innovating on our runtime models we use downstream of them for ads inference. For example, we began piloting a new runtime ads ranking model in Q3 that leverages more compute and data than our prior models to select more relevant ads. In testing, we've seen this new model drive a more than 2% lift in conversions on Instagram. We also significantly improved performance of Andromeda in Q3 by combining models across retrieval and early-stage ranking into a single model, driving a 14% increase in ads quality on Facebook services. Within our ads products, we're seeing continued momentum with Advantage Plus. In Q3, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage Plus lead campaigns.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nNow advertisers running sales app or lead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning, allowing our systems to look across our platform to optimize performance by automatically choosing criteria like who to show the ads to and where to show them. The annual run rate of revenue running through our end-to-end automated solutions has now reached $60 billion following the implementation of the new streamlined creation flow, as we continue to see more advertisers leverage the performance benefits of our solutions. Within our Advantage Plus Creative Suite, the number of advertisers using at least one of our video generation features was up 20% versus the prior quarter, as adoption of image animation and video expansion continues to scale. We've also added more generative AI features to make it easier for advertisers to optimize their ad creatives and drive increased performance.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn Q3, we introduced AI-generated music so advertisers can have music generated for their ad that aligns with the tone and message of the creative. Finally, business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us. We're seeing strong growth across our portfolio of solutions, including with click-to-WhatsApp ads, which grew revenue 60% year over year in Q3. We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales. We've been opening access in recent months to more businesses within our initial test markets, the Philippines and Mexico, and have seen strong usage with millions of conversations between people and business AIs taking place since July. This month, we expanded availability within WhatsApp and Messenger to all eligible businesses in Mexico and the Philippines, respectively.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn the U.S., we're also starting to roll out the ability for merchants to add their business AIs to their website so we can support the full sale funnel from ad to purchase. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus is deploying capital to support the company's highest order priorities, including developing leading AI products, models, and business solutions. As we make significant investments in infrastructure to support this work, we are focused on preserving maximum long-term flexibility to ensure we can meet our future capacity needs while also being able to respond to how the market develops in the years ahead. We're doing so in several ways, including staging data center sites so we can spring up capacity quickly in future years as we need it, as well as establishing strategic partnerships that give us option value for future compute needs.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThe strong financial position and cash generation of our business enable us to make these investments while also accessing additional pools of cost-efficient capital. Moving to our financial outlook, we expect Q4 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $56 to $59 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Our outlook reflects an expectation for continued strong ad revenue growth, partially offset by lower year-over-year Reality Labs revenue in Q4. The anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to us lapping the introduction of Quest 3S in Q4 of last year, as well as retail partners procuring Quest headsets during Q3 of this year to prepare for the holiday season, which were recorded as revenue in the third quarter.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nTurning to the expense and CapEx outlooks, I'll first start with 2025 before providing some commentary on our planning for 2026. We expect full-year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $116 to $118 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $114 to $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 22% to 24% year over year. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $70 to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $66 to $72 billion. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our Q4 2025 tax rate to be 12% to 15%.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nTurning now to 2026, we are at an exciting point for our company, where we have continued runway to improve our core services today, as well as the opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future. We expect the set of investments we're making within our ads and organic engagement initiatives next year will enable us to continue to deliver strong revenue growth in 2026, while our progress on AI models and products will position us to capitalize on new revenue opportunities in the years to come. A central requirement to realizing these opportunities is infrastructure capacity. As we have begun to plan for next year, it's become clear that our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully, including versus our own expectations last quarter.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe are still working through our capacity plans for next year, but we expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs, both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. We anticipate this will provide further upward pressure on our CapEx and expense plans next year. As a result, our current expectation is that CapEx dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025. We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster % rate in 2026 than 2025, with growth primarily driven by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth, as we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent and ad technical talent in priority areas.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nFinally, we continue to monitor active legal and regulatory matters, including the increasing headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and financial results. For example, in the EU, we continue to engage constructively with the European Commission on our less personalized ads offering. However, we cannot rule out the Commission imposing further changes to that offering that could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as this quarter. In the U.S., a number of youth-related trials are scheduled for 2026 and may ultimately result in a material loss. In closing, this was another good quarter for our business. We have an exciting set of opportunities to continue improving our core business while delivering innovative new experiences and services for the people and businesses using our products in the years to come.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, again, press star one. Please limit yourself to one question. Please pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are streaming today's call, please mute your computer speakers. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n**Brian Nowak** (Analyst)\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two for Susan. The first one, Susan, the pipeline for core improvements to come in 2026 with models and ad ranking models and more types of compute seems very exciting, and the infrastructure build seems sizable behind that. Can you help us a little understand some of the early quantifiable signals you're seeing on A/B tests from some of these improvements to come that make you most excited and give you confidence you're going to get ROIC from all this CapEx? That's the first one. The second one's a little faster. How large is the Reality Labs revenue headwind in the 4Q guidance? Thanks.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThanks, Brian, for the question. I think your first question had a couple parts to it, so I'm going to try to disaggregate those parts and let me know if this addresses what you're getting to. I will say that the growth in 2026 CapEx relative to 2025 comes from growth in each of the core areas: Meta Superintelligence Labs, core AI, as well as non-AI spend. All of those areas are growing, but the Meta Superintelligence Labs AI needs are growing the most. In terms of the core AI pipeline, I think we talked about last year when we were going into the 2025 budget process, we had a roadmap of resource investments across both headcount and compute that we thought would pay off in 2026. It's really a very broad range of different ads ranking and performance efforts.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe're continuing to see that those have paid off through the course of the year. There is a long list of specific efforts, but one of the measures that we look at to monitor this is how are we driving ad performance? How are conversions growing? Conversions is a complex metric for us because advertisers optimize for so many different conversions on different values. When we control for that and look at value-weighted conversion rates, we're seeing very strong year-over-year growth, and weighted conversions continue to grow faster than impressions. We also talked about some of the new model architecture over the course of the year and the degree to which the new model architecture is enabling us also to take advantage of having more data and more compute to drive ads performance. We expect that that's going to be a continued story in 2026.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe are, in fact, at the beginning of our 2026 budgeting process now, and we see a similar list of revenue investments that we're excited to be able to invest in. We think that that's going to be a big part of our ability to continue to drive strong revenue performance throughout the year. On your second question, which is the Reality Labs revenue headwind, I don't think we have quantified the exact size of that. We expect that Q4 Reality Labs revenue will be lower than last year for a couple of reasons that I alluded to. The biggest factor is we're lapping the introduction of Quest 3S in Q4 of last year, and we don't have a new headset in the market this year. We also recorded all of our holiday-related Quest 3S sales in Q4 2024 since the headset was launched in October 2024.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis year, we're recognizing some of those Quest 3S sales in Q3 as retail partners have procured Quest headsets in advance of the holiday season. We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug M. with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Doug Anmuth** (Analyst)\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the strategy to front-load capacity for superintelligence. Can you just talk about your thought process in kind of triangulating the CapEx dollar growth and the significantly faster expense growth next year with core growth in the business, then the impact on earnings and free cash flow? Do you have targets that we should be thinking about for cash on hand or net cash overall? Thanks.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThanks, Doug. We're right now, I would say, in the process of—we're relatively early, actually still in the process of putting together our budget for 2026. It is, on the capacity side, a particularly dynamic process. We're certainly seeing that we wish we had more capacity today than we do. We would be able to put it towards good use. Certainly, not only would the Meta Superintelligence Labs team appreciate having more capacity, but we'd be able to put it towards good and ROI positive use in the core business as well. We're really trying to plan ahead not only to ensure that we have the capacity we need in 2026, but also to give ourselves the sort of flexibility and option value to have the capacity that we think we could need in 2027 and 2028. That said, there are lots of moving pieces in the budget.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIt's not baked yet. It's still sort of in the process of coming together. We don't have specific targets to share, but we do feel like our strategic priority is really making sure that we have the compute that we need to be well positioned to succeed at AI. That's sort of the foremost priority as we're putting together the budget.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nYeah, I mean, I'll add a few thoughts on this too, although, as Susan said, we're still working through the actual budget, and I think we'll typically have more to share on that early next year. To date, we keep on seeing this pattern where we build some amount of infrastructure to what we think is an aggressive assumption, and then we keep on having more demand to be able to use more compute, especially in the core business in ways that we think would be quite profitable than we end up having compute for.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think that suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over some period because the primary use of it is going to be to accelerate the AI research and the new AI work that we're doing and how that relates to both the core business and new products. Any compute that we don't need for that, we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to absorb a very large amount of that to just convert into more intelligence and better recommendations in our family of apps and ads in a profitable way. Of course, it's possible to overshoot that, right? If we do, this is what I mentioned in my comments, then we see that there's just a lot of demand for other new things that we would build internally, externally.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nAlmost every week, people come to us from outside the company asking us to stand up an API service or asking if we have different compute that they could get from us. We haven't done that yet, but obviously, if you got to a point where you overbuilt, you could have that as an option. The very worst case would be that we effectively have just pre-built for a couple of years, in which case, of course, there would be some loss and depreciation, but we'd grow into that and use it over time.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nMy view on this is that rather than continuing to be constrained on CapEx and feeling in the core business like we have significant investments that we could make that we're not able to make that would be profitable, the right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need both for the AI research and new things that we're doing and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business. That's kind of how I'm thinking about that overall. Of course, there's a lot of operational constraints too on what one can build, right? We are basically trying to work through this all, and I think we'll have more to share in the coming months and over the course of next year.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think that there's just a huge, huge amount of opportunities ahead here.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Eric Sheridan** (Analyst)\nThanks so much for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to reflect on some of your comments with respect to scaling towards superintelligence and bringing it back to consumer AI. Maybe reflect a little bit on the signals you've gotten on the way consumers across family of apps interact with Meta AI today and how you think about scaling and exiting models from the superintelligence effort might change the utility and behavior around Meta AI in the years ahead. Thanks.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nYeah, I mean, a lot of people use Meta AI today. As I said in my comments up front, there's more than a billion people who use it on a monthly basis. What we see is that as we improve the quality of the model, primarily for post-training Llama 4 at this point, we continue to see improvements in usage.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nOur view is that when we get the new models that we're building in Meta Superintelligence Labs in there and get truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don't have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity. We know, I mean, I would guess that Meta Platforms has the best track record of any company out there of taking a new product that people love and getting it to billions of people in terms of usage. I think that the ability to plug in leading models is going to, I would predict, lead to a very large amount of use of these things over the coming years. I'm very excited about that in terms of new products. It's not just Meta AI as an assistant.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think that there are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we're starting to see that with video and content creation. I think there's going to be a lot more like that that I'm quite excited about. There are the business versions of all of these too, like Business AI. Of course, one part of the story is the new things that will be possible to build. The other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that we make across the family of apps and improve the recommendations and advertising. I think that there's just a, as we've shown, there's sort of this very large amount of headroom, and the opportunity there keeps growing as we are improving and optimizing the AI there.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think that really shows no sign of being near the end. I think that there's quite a bit more to do there. Like I said in response to the last question, we are sort of perennially operating the family of apps and ads business in a compute-starved state at this point, which is, on the one hand, sort of an odd thing to say given the compute that we've built up. We really are taking a lot of the resources and using them to advance future things that we're doing. We think that there's a lot more compute that we could put towards these that would just unlock a huge amount of opportunity in the core business as well.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Schmulick with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mark Shmulik** (Analyst)\nYes, hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Susan, as you think about the visibility into kind of the runway next year of continued ad performance and engagement improvements, how do you think about kind of the scale of those improvements versus kind of the progress we've seen over the last two years? Mark, as you think about kind of the timing of some of these newer efforts coming out of Meta Superintelligence Labs, is us anchoring to kind of an updated frontier model launch sometime next year like the right way for us to think about it? Should we be looking at kind of progress from new products you're excited to see ship like Vibes? Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThanks, Mark. On the sort of ads improvement side, some of the innovations that we have been launching actually involve improving our larger scale models. We don't use our larger model architectures like GEM for inference because their size and complexity would make it too cost-prohibitive. The way that we drive performance from those models is by using them to transfer knowledge to smaller, lightweight models that are used at runtime. In addition to the foundation model work, we are working on advancing our inference models by developing new techniques and architectures that then allow us to scale up compute and complexity in an ROI-positive way. In general, we obviously have a very large base of advertisers.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThere's a lot of demand liquidity in the system, and even small scale improvements that we are able to make in terms of driving basis point improvements in the performance of ads or single-digit increases in conversions relative to impressions in a given quarter off of a large base mean that we're really able to continue to grow the absolute dollars of revenue growth in a pretty meaningful way.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\n**Justin Post** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nHey, Justin, just give us one second. I think there was a second part of Mark's question that we just want to get to on Meta Superintelligence Labs.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI'll keep it quick. I don't think we have any specific timing to announce certainly on the models or products, but I expect that you will see both. We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I'm excited to share more when we have it.\n\n**Operator**\nJustin, please go ahead.\n\n**Justin Post** (Analyst)\nGreat, thanks. Mark, you mentioned the prior two content cycles, and obviously, you've been able to generate very attractive margins on them. As we get into the AI cycle, obviously, some concerns on the investment. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about tools that could be coming out for users? I know there's some new competition. Secondly, how do you think about margins in this content cycle? Any reason to think they would be different versus prior cycles? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think it's too early to really understand what the margins are going to be for the new products that we build. I think certainly each product has somewhat different characteristics, and I think we'll kind of understand how that goes over time. My general goal is to build a business that maximizes value for the people who use our products and maximizes profitability, not margins.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think we'll kind of just try to build the best things that we can and try to deliver the most value that we can for most people.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ross Sandler** (Analyst)\nGreat. Hey, Mark, some of the goals for competing AI labs are around achieving AGI or these other milestones that are kind of like out there and a little esoteric. How are you setting up your new team in terms of achieving those types of goals versus products that can generate revenue from Meta kind of right out of the gate? Is the goal that you had articulated to us previously around giving billions of people kind of a personal AI to use still the direction of travel that you see, or are there other things like kind of this Vibes or Sora angle that you think are potentially important? How should we think about the overall direction? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nSure. The way that I think about this is that the research is going to enable new technological capabilities to exist, and then those capabilities can get built into all kinds of different products. The ability to reason more intelligently is, for example, very important across a large number of things. It would be useful for an assistant. It will also be useful in business AI. It will also be useful in the AI agent that we're building to help advertisers figure out what their campaigns are going to be. It will also have implications for eventually how we do ranking and recommendations of people's feeds and make different decisions there. That's just one example. Certainly, the capability to be able to produce very high-quality, good video is going to be useful for giving people new creative tools.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nIt will help increase the amount of content inventory that can be shown in Instagram and Facebook and therefore should enable an increase in engagement there. It should help advertisers be able to create creative that will help us monetize better. You can just go kind of down the list of capabilities that you'd expect. I think each one will enable a bunch of different things. I think the art of product development here is looking at the list of technology capabilities and figuring out what new products are going to be useful and prioritizing those. Fundamentally, I would sort of expect this exponential curve in new technology capabilities that are going to become available.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThe other thing that I expect is that I think being the best in a given area will drive great returns rather than this is not like a check-the-box exercise of like, OK, we can generate some kind of content and someone else can. I think that the company that is the best at each of these capabilities, I think, will get a large amount of the potential value for doing that. There are lots of different capabilities to build. I'm not sure that any one company is going to be the best at all of them. I doubt that's going to be the case. A lot of what we're trying to do is not like not kind of do some things that others have done. We're really trying to build novel capabilities.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI'm keeping this high level because I don't want to necessarily, from a competitive or strategic perspective, get into what we're prioritizing. That hopefully gives you a sense of how we're thinking about what we're doing. We want to be able to kind of build novel things, build them into a lot of our products, and then have the compute to scale them to billions of people. We think that that's going to both show up in terms of new products being possible and new businesses and very significant improvements to the current business too.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahoney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mark Mahaney** (Analyst)\nThanks. Can I just ask a question on Meta AI and both the product and the monetization path? When you look at it, what you've seen that's most encouraging to you in terms of the adoption and the use of Meta AI, and then when you think about, I know you generally like to roll out and then deepen engagement and then later think about monetization, where do you think you are on that path now? Is it clear to you what the monetization options are for Meta AI? Thank you very much.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI mean, I think the most promising thing that we're seeing is, one, that we were able to build something that a large number of people use. I think that that's valuable. Secondly, there is a clear correlation as we improve the models in ways that we think make them better, that people use them more. That shows that we have a runway to basically be able to improve engagement and turn this into a product that's leading over time. In terms of where we are on this, we basically just did this huge effort to boot up Meta Superintelligence Labs and build what I am very proud of. I think the highest talent density lab in the industry at this point.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThere are a lot of really great researchers and infrastructure folks and data folks who are now a part of this effort who are focused on training the next generation of work and doing some really novel work. When that is ready, I think that we will be able to plug that into a number of the products that we're building. I think that that will be very exciting. I think that that's really the next thing that we're looking at. From there, I think that these models will also improve monetization in all of the different ways that we've talked about so far in terms of improving engagement, improving advertising, helping advertisers engage.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThe one opportunity that we usually talk about on these calls but hasn't come up as much here is just the ability to make it so that advertisers are increasingly just going to be able to give us a business objective and give us a credit card or bank account and have the AI system basically figure out everything else that's necessary, including generating video or different types of creative that might resonate with different people that are personalized in different ways, finding who the right customers are. All of the capabilities that we're building, I think, go towards improving all of these different things. I'm quite optimistic about that.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Ronald Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ronald Josey** (Analyst)\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. This maybe dovetails perfectly off of Mark, what you just talked about. We heard a lot about end-to-end automation here, I think, reaching a $60 billion ARR. I wanted to hear about if you can talk to us more just about adoption rates amongst the advertisers and then maybe bigger picture as you incorporate ranking recommendation changes like Andromeda or GEMS or Lattice. Just talk to us how this automation is driving, call it, a higher ROI for advertisers overall if you bring it all together. Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nYeah, we've been sort of laying the continued brick-by-brick build of Advantage Plus and extending the set of objectives that it applies to over time. In Q3, we completed the global rollout of the streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage Plus lead campaigns. Now advertisers who are running sales app or lead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning. Like the kind of application of the streamlined campaign creation flow for other objectives, this generally allows advertisers to optimize and automate several aspects of the campaign setup process at once. That includes things like audience selection, where to show the ad, how the budget gets paced and distributed across ad sets to drive the most efficient outcomes. We see that Advantage Plus continues to drive performance gains.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAdvertisers who run lead campaigns using Advantage Plus are seeing a 14% lower cost per lead on average than those who are not. I would say that we think that there is still a lot of opportunity generally to grow adoption of Advantage Plus. A lot of advertisers only use our end-to-end automated solutions for a portion of their campaigns, so we can grow share there. To capture that opportunity, we're focused on driving continued performance improvements and addressing some of the key use cases that we still need in order to grow adoption. We're also working to broaden adoption among advertisers who use one of our single-step automated solutions, for example, advertisers who might only use a piece of it, like Advantage Plus audiences, by helping them understand the benefits of using more than one automated solution at the same time.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nI would say Advantage Plus is sort of an ongoing platform by which we both continue to expand the feature set that is available in Advantage Plus and then expand the extensibility or the coverage of that feature set to the broader set of advertisers. I think Mark mentioned that the annual revenue run rate now for advertisers who are using these automated options is $60 billion. We see that there's room to continue growing that.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Yousef Squali with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n**Youssef Squali** (Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you very much, Mark. On wearables in particular, do you think you'll be able to sell enough hardware to recoup your investment, or is that dependent on maybe creating new avenues for revenue from things like advertising services and commerce through that new computing platform? If so, what are kind of the gating factors there? Susan, how do you see the on-balance sheet versus off-balance sheet financing of your AI initiatives? You've recently struck a deal with Blue Owl for the Louisiana data center. Is that part of the CapEx guide for 2026? If it's not, how significant will that way of funding be for Meta going forward? Basically, would that slow down your CapEx growth past 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI can talk about wearables, and then Susan can jump in on the other part. I think that there are a few pieces here. One is that the work on Ray-Ban Meta and the Oakley Meta Vanguards products is going very well. I think, yeah, I mean, at some point, if these continue going as well as it has been, then I think it will be a very profitable investment. I think that there's some revenue that we get from basically selling the devices and then some that will come from additional services and from the AI on top of it. I think that there's a big opportunity. Certainly, the investment here is not just to kind of build just the device. It's also to build these services on top.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nRight now, a lot of people get the devices for a range of things that don't even include the AI, even though they like the AI. I think over time, the AI is going to become the main thing that people are using them for. I think that that's going to end up having a big business opportunity by itself. As products like the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta Vanguards are growing, we're also going to keep on investing in things like the more full field of view product form of the Orion prototype that we showed at Connect last year. Those things are obviously earlier in their curve towards getting to being a sustaining business. Our general view is that we want to build these out to reach many hundreds of millions or billions of people.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThat's the point at which we think that this is going to be just an extremely profitable business.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nYousef, to your second question, the JV that we announced with Blue Owl is sort of an example of finding a solution that enabled us to partner with external capital providers to co-develop data centers in a way that gives us long-term optionality in supporting our future capacity needs, just given both the magnitude but also uncertainty of what the capacity outlook in future years looks like. In terms of how that is recognized as CapEx, our prior CapEx reflected a portion of the data center build cost prior to the joint venture being established. Going forward, the construction costs of the data center will not be recorded in CapEx. As the data center is constructed, we will contribute 20% of the remaining construction costs required, which is in line with our ownership stake. Those will be recorded as other investing cash flows.\n\n**Operator**\nYour last question comes from the line of Kenneth Dorell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ken Gawrelski** (Analyst)\nThank you. Just one for me, please. Mark, as you think about with hopefully a leading frontier model next year in hand, could you talk about where you think the value will accrue in this evolving ecosystem? Will it be with the platforms, or do you think that this will be mostly the value will accrue to the scaled first-party applications? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI guess I'm not exactly sure what you mean by platform versus application in this context. I think that there's just a lot of value to create with AI overall. Clearly, you're seeing the people who are making the hardware, NVIDIA is doing an amazing job, right? I think extremely well-deserved success. The cloud partners and companies are doing very well. I think that will likely continue. I think that there's a huge opportunity there. If you look at it today, the companies that are building apps, a lot of the apps are still relatively small. I think that's obviously going to be a huge opportunity. What we've seen overall is basically people take individual technology advances and build them into products that then build either communities or other kinds of network effects and then end up being very sustaining businesses.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nI think what we haven't really seen as much in the history of the technology industry is the rate of new capabilities being introduced because around each of these capabilities, you can build many new products that I think each will turn into interesting businesses. I don't know. I'm generally pretty optimistic about there being a very large opportunity. In terms of new things to build, I think being able to build them and then scale them to billions of people is a huge muscle that Meta has developed, and I think we do very well. I certainly think that's going to deliver a huge amount of value, both in the core business for all the ways that we talked about, how it's going to improve recommendations and the quality of the services, as well as unifying the models together.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThat way, when these systems are deciding what to show, they can just pull from a wider pool. These are things that we've just seen over the 20-plus years of running the company, that they just deliver consistent wins. We're going to keep on being able to make the systems more general and smarter and make better recommendations for people and have a larger pool of inventory. That is all going to be great. There's going to be a lot of new things that I think we're going to be able to take and scale to billions of people over time and build new businesses, whether that's advertising or commerce supported or people paying for it or different kinds of things. I think it's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (CEO)\nThat's giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we're not underinvesting.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nGreat. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.\n\n**Operator**\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGood afternoon. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session.\n\n**Operator**\nSession. And this call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Kenneth Dorrell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director - IR)\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta's second quarter twenty twenty five earnings conference call. Joining me today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Lee, CFO. Our remarks today will include forward looking statements, which are based on assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10 Q filed with the SEC.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director - IR)\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.atmeta.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAlright. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another strong quarter with more than 3,400,000,000 people using at least one of our apps each day and strong engagement across the board. Our business continues to perform very well, which enables us to invest heavily in our AI efforts.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOver the last few months, we've begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves, and the improvement is slow for now but undeniable. And developing superintelligence, which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way, we think is now in sight. Meta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives. And we believe that this has the potential to begin an exciting new era of individual empowerment. A lot has been written about all the economic and scientific advances that superintelligence can bring, and I'm extremely optimistic about this.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nBut I think that if history is a guide, then an even more important role will be how superintelligence empowers people to be more creative, develop culture and communities, connect with each other, and lead more fulfilling lives. To build this future, we've established Meta Superintelligence Labs, which includes our foundations, product, and fair teams as well as a new lab that is focused on developing the next generation of our models. We're making good progress towards LAMA four point one and four point two. And in parallel, we are also working on our next generation of models that will push the frontier in the next year or so. We're building an elite talent dense team.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAlexander Wang is leading the overall team. Nat Friedman is leading our AI products and applied research, and Xingjia Zhao is chief scientist for the new effort. They are all incredibly talented leaders, and I'm excited to work closely with them and the world class group of AI researchers and infrastructure and data engineers that we're assembling. I spent a lot of time building this team this quarter, and the reason that so many people are excited to join is because Meta has all of the ingredients that are required to build leading models and deliver them to billions of people. The people who are joining us are gonna have access to unparalleled compute as we build out several multi gigawatt clusters.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOur Prometheus cluster is coming online next year, and we think it's going to be the world's first gigawatt plus cluster. We're also building out Hyperion, which will be able to scale up to five gigawatts over several years, and we have multiple more Titan clusters in development as well. We are making all these investments because we have conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do. From a business perspective, I mentioned last quarter that there are five basic opportunities that we are pursuing, improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices. So I can go into a bit of detail on each.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOn advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and and gains across our ad system. This quarter, we expanded our new AI powered recommendation model for ads to new surfaces and improved its performance by using more signals and longer context. It's it's driven roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. We're also seeing good progress with AI for ad creative, with a meaningful percent of our ad revenue now coming from campaigns using one of our generative AI features. This is gonna be especially valuable for smaller advertisers with limited budgets, while agencies will continue, the important work to help larger brands apply these tools strategically.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThe second opportunity is more engaging experiences. AI is significantly improving our ability to show people content that they're gonna find interesting and useful. Advancements in our recommendation systems have improved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram just this quarter. There is a lot of potential for content itself to get better too. We're seeing early progress with the launch of our AI video editing tools across Meta AI and our new edits app, and there's a lot more to do here.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThe third opportunity is business messaging. I've talked before about how I believe every business will soon have a business AI just like they have an email address, social media account, and website. We're starting to see some product market fit in a number of countries where we're testing these agents, and we're integrating these business AIs into ads on Facebook and Instagram as well as directly into ecommerce websites. The fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Its reach is already quite impressive with more than a billion monthly actives.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOur focus is now deepening the experience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI. As we continue improving our models, we see engagement grow, so our next generation of models is gonna continue to really help here. And the fifth opportunity is AI devices. We continue to see strong momentum with our Ray Ban Meta Glasses with sales accelerating. We are also launching new performance AI glasses with the Oakley Meta Houstons.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThey have longer battery life, higher resolution camera, and are designed for sports. The percent of people using Meta AI is growing, and we're seeing new users' AI retention increase too, which is a good sign, for that continued use. I think that AI glasses are gonna be the main way that we integrate superintelligence into our day to day lives, so it's important to have all of these different styles and products that appeal to different people in different settings. Finally, we're seeing people continue to spend more time with our Quest ecosystem, and the community continues to grow steadily. We launched the Meta Quest three s Xbox edition last month, and we're seeing record interest in cloud gaming.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd beyond gaming, we continue to see a broader set of use cases with media and web browsing contributing a significant portion of engagement. We're gonna have more to share on all of this, especially the Reality Labs work at Connect on September 17. So I encourage you all to tune into that. Overall, this has been a busy quarter. Strong business performance and and real momentum in assembling both the talent and the compute that we need to build personal superintelligence for everyone.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI am very grateful to our teams who are working hard to deliver all of this, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here's Susan.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year over year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $47,500,000,000 up 22% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q two total expenses were $27,100,000,000 up 12% compared to last year.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 16% driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of several useful lives. R and D increased 23% mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 9% primarily due to an increase in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity efforts as well as marketing costs partially offset by lower employee compensation. G and A decreased 27% driven mostly by lower legal related costs. We ended Q2 with over 75,900 employees down 1% quarter over quarter as the vast majority of the employees impacted by performance related reductions earlier this year were no longer captured in our headcount.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis was partially offset by continued hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, AI, as well as regulation and compliance. Second quarter operating income was $20,400,000,000 representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11% which reflects excess tax benefits from share based compensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods. Net income was $18,300,000,000 or $7.14 per share. Capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases were $17,000,000,000 driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nFree cash flow was $8,500,000,000 We repurchased $9,800,000,000 of our Class A common stock and paid 1,300,000,000 in dividends to shareholders. We also made $15,100,000,000 in non marketable equity investments in the second quarter which includes our minority investment in Scale AI along with other investment activities. We ended the quarter with $47,100,000,000 in cash and marketable securities and $28,800,000,000 in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOur community across the Family of Apps continues to grow and we estimate more than 3,400,000,000 people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June. Q two total family of apps revenue was $47,100,000,000 up 22% year over year. Q two family of apps ad revenue was $46,600,000,000 up 21 or 22% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year over year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and rest of world at 2423% respectively.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nNorth America and Asia Pacific grew 2118%. In q two, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 11% with growth mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Impression growth accelerated across all regions due primarily to engagement tailwinds on both Facebook and Instagram and to a lesser extent ad load optimizations on Facebook. The average price per ad increased 9% benefiting from increased advertiser demand largely driven by improved ad performance. Pricing growth slowed modestly from the first quarter due to the accelerated impression growth in Q2.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $583,000,000 up 50% driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. We continue to direct majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our family of apps. In q two, family of apps expenses were $22,200,000,000 representing 82% of our overall expenses. Family of expenses were up 14% mainly due to growth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs partially offset by lower legal related costs. Family of Apps operating income was $25,000,000,000 representing a 53% operating margin.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, q two revenue was $370,000,000 up 5% year over year due to increased sales of AI glasses partially offset by lower Quest sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4,900,000,000 up 1% year over year driven by higher non headcount related technology development costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $4,500,000,000 Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOn the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp as we make additional improvements to our recommendation systems and product experiences. We continue to see momentum with video engagement in particular. In q two, Instagram video time was up more than 20% year over year globally. We're seeing strong traction on Facebook as well, particularly in The US where video time spent similarly expanded more than 20% year over year. These gains have been enabled by ongoing optimizations to our ranking systems to better identify the most relevant content to show.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe expect to deliver additional improvements throughout the year as we further scale up our models and make recommendations more adaptive to a person's interest within their session. Another emphasis of our recommendations work is promoting original content. On Instagram, over two thirds of recommended content in The US now comes from original posts. In the second half, we'll be focused on further increasing the freshness of original posts so the right audiences can discover original content from creators soon after it is posted. We are also making good progress on our longer term ranking innovations that we expect will provide the next leg of improvements over the coming years.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOur research efforts to develop cross surface foundation recommendation models continue to progress. We are also seeing promising results from using LLMs in threads recommendation systems. The incorporation of LLMs are now driving a meaningful share of the ranking related time spent gains on threats. We're now exploring how to extend the use of LLMs in recommendation systems to our other apps. We're leveraging LAMA and several other back end processes as well including actioning bug reports so we can identify and resolve recurring issues more quickly and efficiently.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis has resulted in top line bug reports in The U. S. And Canada in Facebook feed and notifications dropping by roughly 30% over the past ten months. The primary way we're using LaMa in our apps today is to power Meta AI which is now available in over 200 countries and territories. WhatsApp continues to be the largest driver of queries as people message Meta AI directly for tasks such as information gathering, homework assistance, and generating images.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOutside of WhatsApp, we're seeing Meta AI become an increasingly valuable complement to our content discovery engines. Meta AI usage on Facebook is expanding as people use it to ask about posts they see in feed and find content across our platform and search. Another way we expect Meta AI will help with content discovery is through the automatic translation and dubbing of foreign language content into the audience's local language. We'll have more to share on our efforts there later this year. Moving to Reality Labs.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThe growth of Ray Ban Meta sales accelerated in q two with demand still outstripping supply for the most popular SKUs despite increases to our production earlier this year. We're working to ramp supply to better meet consumer demand later this year. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn q two, we also began introducing ads within feed on threads and the updates tab of WhatsApp, which is a separate space away from people's chats. As of May, advertisers globally can now run video and image ads to Threads users in most countries including The United States. While ad supply remains low and Threads is not expected to be a meaningful contributor to overall impression growth in the near term, we are optimistic about the longer term opportunity with threads as the community and engagement grow and monetization scales. On WhatsApp, we are rolling out ads and status and channels along with channel subscriptions in the updates tab to help businesses reach the more than 1,500,000,000 daily actives who visit that part of the app. We expect the introduction of ads and status will be gradual over the course of this year and next with low levels of expected ad supply initially.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe also expect WhatsApp Ads and Status to earn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future due in part towards WhatsApp's skew toward lower monetizing markets and more limited information that can be used for targeting. Given this, we do not expect ads and status to be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for the next few years. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. There are three areas of this work that I'll focus on today. Improving our ad systems, advancing our ads products including by building tools that assist in ads creation, and evolving our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business's objectives.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nFirst is our ad systems where we're innovating in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages to serve more relevant ads to people. A lot of this work involves us continuing to advance the modeling innovations we've introduced previously while expanding their adoption across our platform. The Andromeda model architecture we began introducing in the 2024 powers the ads retrieval stage of our ad system, where we select the few thousand most relevant ads from tens of millions of potential candidates. In q two, we made enhancements to Andromeda that enabled it to select more relevant and more personalized ads candidates while also expanding coverage to Facebook reels. These improvements have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook mobile feed and reels.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOur new generative ads recommendation system or GEM powers the ranking stage of our ad system which is the part of the process after ads retrieval where we determine which ads to show someone from candidates suggested by our retrieval engine. In q two, we improved the performance of GEM by further scaling our training capacity and adding organic and ads engagement data on Instagram. We also incorporated new advanced sequence modeling techniques that helped us double the length of event sequences we use enabling our systems to consider a longer history of the content or ads that a person has engaged with in order to provide better ad selections. The combination of these improvements increased ad conversions by approximately 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook feed and reels in q two. Finally, we expanded coverage of our Lattice model architecture in q two.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe first began deploying Lattice in 2023 with our later stage ads ranking efforts allowing us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ads models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. In April, we began deploying Lattice to earlier stage ads ranking models as well. This is leading not only to greater capacity and engineering efficiency, but also improved performance. With the recent Lattice deployments driving a nearly 4% increase in ad conversions across Facebook feed and reels in q two. Next, ad products.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nHere, we're seeing strong momentum with our advantage plus suite of AI powered solutions. In q two, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for advantage plus sales and app campaigns, which makes it easier for advertisers to realize the performance benefits from Advantage Plus by having it turned on at the beginning. We've seen lifts in advertiser adoption of sales and app campaigns since we've expanded availability and are working to complete the rollout for leads campaigns in the coming months. Within our advantage plus creative suite, adoption of GenAI ad creative tools continues to broaden. Nearly 2,000,000 advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation, and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nIn q two, we started testing AI powered translations so that advertisers can automatically translate the caption of their ads to 10 different languages. While it's early, we've seen promising performance lifts in our prelaunch tests. We're also continuing to see strong adoption of image expansion among small and medium sized advertisers, which speaks to how these tools help businesses who have fewer resources to develop creative. With larger advertisers, we expect agencies will continue to be valuable partners in helping apply these new tools to drive performance. Outside of Advantage Plus, we're seeing good momentum in business messaging, particularly in The US where click to message revenue grew more than 40% year over year in q two.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThe strong US growth is benefiting from a ramp in adoption of our website to message ads, which drive people to a business's website for more information before choosing to launch a chat with the business in one of our messaging apps. Finally, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business's objectives and the way they measure results. In q two, we completed the global rollout of our incremental attribution feature, which is the only product on the market that optimizes for and reports on incremental conversions, which are conversions that would not have happened without a person seeing the ad. We also launched omnichannel ads globally in q two, which enable advertisers to optimize for incremental sales both in store and online with just one campaign. In tests, advertisers using omnichannel ads have seen a median 15% reduction in total cost per purchase compared to website only optimization.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. I'll start with hiring. Our approach to adding headcount continues to be targeted at the company's highest priority areas. We expect talent additions across all of our priority areas will continue to drive overall headcount growth through this year in 2026, while headcount growth in our other functions remains constrained.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWithin AI, we've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives. Next, infrastructure. We expect having sufficient compute capacity will be central to realizing many of the largest opportunities in front of us over the coming years. We continue to see very compelling returns from our AI capacity investments in our core ads and organic engagement initiatives and expect to continue investing significantly there in 2026. We also expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nSo we expect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect third quarter twenty twenty five total revenue to be in the range of $47,500,000,000 to $50,500,000,000 Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year over year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing an outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year over year growth rate in the 2025 to be slower than the third quarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the 2024. Turning now to the expense outlook.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of 114,000,000,000 to $118,000,000,000 narrowed from our prior outlook of $113,000,000,000 to $118,000,000,000 and reflecting a growth rate of 20 to 24% year over year. While we're still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet. Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses for employees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in a 2026 year over year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth rate.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We currently expect twenty twenty five capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases to be in the range of 66,000,000,000 to $72,000,000,000 narrowed from our prior outlook of $64,000,000,000 to $72,000,000,000 and up approximately $30,000,000,000 year over year at the midpoint. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant CapEx dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and business operations. Onto tax. With the enactment of the new US tax law, we anticipate a reduction in our US federal cash tax for the remainder of the current year and future years.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThere are several alternative ways of implementing the provisions of the act which we are currently evaluating. While we estimate that the 2025 tax rate will be higher than our q two tax rate, we cannot quantify the magnitude at this time. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in The EU that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. For example, we continue to engage with the European Commission on our less personalized ads offering or LPA, which we introduced in November 2024 based on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA. As the commission provides further feedback on LPA, we cannot rule out that it may seek to impose further modifications to it that would result in a materially worse user and advertiser experience.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThis could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as later this quarter. We have appealed the European Commission's DMA decision, but any modifications to our model may be imposed during the appeal process. In closing, this was another strong quarter for our business as our investments in infrastructure and technical talent continue to improve core ads performance and engagement on our platforms. We expect the significant investments we're making now will allow us to continue leveraging advances in AI to extend those gains and unlock a new set of opportunities in the years to come. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. You. And your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Eric Sheridan** (Managing Director)\nThanks so much for taking the questions. Mark, when you think about where the AI parts of your business have been evolving over the last three to six months, wanted to know what your key learnings were as you went deep into that strategy that informed some of the shifts in both talent acquisition and compute, coupled with some of the blogs you put out recently in terms of how that strategy might have evolved based on those key learnings. And Susan, building on Mark's comments on scaling talent and compute, I wonder if you go a little bit deeper in how we should be thinking about those two components driving some of the commentary you've given around the OpEx and CapEx over the next twelve to eighteen months. Thanks so much.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. Sure. I can start. At at a high level, I think that there are all these questions that people have about what are gonna be the timelines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence or, you know, whatever whatever you wanna call it. And I guess at each step along the way so far, we've observed the more kind of aggressive assumptions or the fastest assumptions have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd and I think that that just continued to happen over the course of this year too. And someone have given a number of those anecdotes on these earnings calls in the past. And I think, certainly, some of the work that we're seeing with teams internally being able to adapt Llama four to build autonomous AI agents that can help improve the Facebook algorithm to increase quality and engagement are, like I mean, that's, like, a fairly profound thing if you think about it. I mean, it's it's it's happening in low volume right now, so I'm not sure that that result by itself was a major contributor to this quarter's earnings or anything like that. But but I think the trajectory on this stuff is very optimistic.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd I I think it's one of the interesting challenges in in running a business like this now is there's just a very high chance it seems like the world is gonna look pretty different in a few years from now. And on the one hand, there are all these things that we can do. There are improvements to our core products that exist. And then I think we have this principle that that that we believe in across the company, which we tell people, take superintelligence seriously. And the the basic principle is this idea that that we think that this is going to really shape all of our systems sooner rather than later, not necessarily on the on the trajectory of a quarter or two, but on the trajectory of a few years.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd, and I think that that's just gonna change a lot of the assumptions around how different things work across the company. So, anyway, I I think it's basically just we're we're continually observing how how this works, what the trajectory or the pace of of of AI progress has been. I think it continues to be on the faster end, and that, I think, informs a lot of the decisions from everything from the importance and value of having the absolute best and most elite talent teams team at the company to making sure that we have a leading compute fleet so that the people here can do, obviously, the researchers here have more compute per person to be able to lead their research and then roll it out to billions of people across our products, making sure that we build and drive these products through all of the different things that we do, which I think is one of the things that our company is the best in the world at, is basically, you know, when we take a technology, we're good at driving that through all of our apps and our ad systems and all that stuff.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nIt's not just gonna kinda sit on the vine. I I I think that there's no other company, I think, that is as good as us at kinda taking something and and kind of getting it in front of billions of people. So, yeah, I mean, we're we're just gonna push very aggressively on all of that. But but at some level, yeah, this is this is there's sort of a bet in the trajectory that we're seeing, and those are the signals that we're seeing. But, we're just trying to read it.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nEric, for the second part of your question, you know, we, we haven't, in fact, kicked off our budgeting process for 2026. So the thinking about next year, there are clearly many, many moving pieces in a very dynamic operating environment. But there are certain aspects that we have some visibility into today, including the rough shape of our 2026 infrastructure plans, you know, and that flows through into our expense expectations next year. And we also have some visibility into the compensation expense growth that we'll recognize from the AI talent that we're hiring this year. And so those, you know, those two things are part of why we gave a little bit of an early preview into the expectations for growth for 2026, total expenses, as well as for 2026, for 2026 CapEx.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nSo on the total expenses side, you know, as I mentioned, we expect infrastructure will be the single largest accelerate, contributor to 2026 expense growth. That's driven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in 2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets that we purchased in place and service in '26 as well as from infrastructure deployed through 2025 that will recognize a full year of depreciation next year. We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in shorter lived assets in 2025 and 2026 than it has been in prior years. And then the other component of infra cost growth next year would come from higher operating expenses, including energy costs, leases, maintenance, and operational expenses that are associated with maintaining that fleet. And we also expect some increased spend on cloud services in '26 to meet our capacity needs as well as growth in network related costs.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nSo a lot going on on the infrastructure side as it contributes to the 2026 total expense number. After that, employee compensation is the next largest driver of expense growth in '26, again, primarily in the investments that we're making in technical talent, including recognizing a full year of compensation expense for the AI talent we hire this year. I realize this answer is getting a little long, so I'll try to wrap up quickly. On the CapEx side, you know, the big driver of our increased CapEx in '26 will be scaling GenAI capacity as we build out training capacity. That's gonna drive higher spend across, you know, servers, networking, data centers next year.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nWe also expect that we're gonna continue investing significantly in CoreAI in 2026. And, again, this is a pretty, you know, very dynamic area of planning, but we wanted to share kind of our our early thoughts as things are shaping up.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n**Brian Nowak** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my question. I've I've two that the first one, Mark, just to kinda go back to the intelligence lab and serve the the vision for super intelligence. As you sort of sit here now versus twelve months ago, can you just sort of walk us through any any changes of technological constraints or technological gating factors that you are most focused on overcoming in the next twenty four months that may have been different than they were in the past just to make sure you can really lead in the idea of superintelligence over the next ten years? And then the second one, to Susan or Mark, one on the core. You've made so many improvements to the core to drive higher engagement recommendations, etcetera.\n\n**Brian Nowak** (Managing Director)\nCan you just walk us through a couple of the factors you're still most excited about to come in the next eighteen months that you think could drive further lift to engagement on the on the core platform? Thanks.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSure. I mean, in terms of, you know, the research agenda and a bunch of the areas that we're very focused on, I I do think focusing on self improvement is a very important area of research. And and there's obviously different scaling paradigms, and and I I don't wanna get too much into the detail of of research that we're doing on on on this. But I I think that for developing superintelligence, at some level, you're not just gonna be learning from people because you're trying to build something that is fundamentally smarter than people. So it's going to need to learn how to, or you're gonna need to develop a way for it to be able to improve itself.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo that, I think, is a is a very fundamental thing that, is going to have very broad implications for how we build products, how we run the company, new things that we can invent, new discoveries that can be made, society more broadly. I I think that that's that's a good just a very fundamental part of this. In in terms of the shape of the effort overall, I guess I've just gotten a little bit more convinced around the the ability for small talent dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research. And it's a it's a bit of a different setup than we have on our other world class machine learning systems. So if you look at, like, what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or thousands of people basically working on improving those systems.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd we have very well developed systems for kind of individuals to run tests and be able to test a bunch of different things. You don't need every researcher there to have the whole system in their head. But I think for this, for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head, which, you know, drives, I think, some of the physics around the team size and and and and how and the dynamics around how that works. But I'll I'll I'll hand it over to Susan to talk about more of the practical stuff.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nBrian, on the, on the sort of forward looking road map for, the core recommendation engine, you know, there are a handful of shorter term things that we're focused on in the near term. One is we're focused on making recommendations even more adaptive to what a person is engaging with during their session so that the recommendations we surface are the most relevant to what they're interested in at that moment. And we're making optimizations to help the best content from smaller creators break out by matching it to the right audiences sooner after it gets posted. We're also working on improving the ability for our systems to discover more diversified and niche interests for each person through interest exploration and learning explicit user preferences. We're also planning to scale up our models further and incorporate more advanced techniques that should improve the overall quality of, of recommendations.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nBut we also have a lot of long term bets in the hopper around areas like developing foundational models that will support recommendations across multiple services, incorporating LLMs more deeply into our recommendations into our recommendation systems. And a big focus of this work is going to be on optimizing the systems to make them more efficient so that we can continue to scale up the capacity that we use for our recommendation systems without eroding the, the ROI that that we deliver.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Douglas Anmuth** (MD &amp; Internet Analyst)\nThanks so much for taking the questions. One for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, Meta has been a huge proponent of open source AI. How has your thinking changed here at all just as you pursue superintelligence and push for even greater returns on your significant infrastructure investments? And then, Susan, your comments on 26 CapEx suggest more than $100,000,000,000 of spend next year potentially.\n\n**Douglas Anmuth** (MD &amp; Internet Analyst)\nDo you continue to expect to finance all this yourself, or could there be opportunities to partner here? Thanks.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. I mean, on on open source, I don't think that our thinking has particularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models and not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open source models. I also think that there are couple of trends that are playing out.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOne is that we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So it's we we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that or if that's, you know, really just primarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that there's there's that concern. And then, obviously, as you approach real superintelligence, I think there's a whole different set of safety concerns that I think we need to take very seriously that I that I wrote about in in in my note this morning. But I think the bottom line is I I I would expect that we will continue open sourcing work.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI I expect us to continue to be a leader there. I also expect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a continuation of of kind of what we what we've been been kind of working on. And and, yeah, I mean, I I think Susan will talk a little bit more about the infrastructure, but it it really is a a massive investment. Know, we think it will be good over time, but, you know, we we do take very seriously that this is a, just massive amount of capital to convert into many gigawatts of compute, which we think is is going to help us produce, leading research and and quality products in in running the business. I do look for opportunities to basically convert capital into quality of products that we can deliver for people, But this is is certainly a a a massive bet that we're we're we're kind of we're focused on, and and we wanna make sure that what we that what we build accrues to building the best products that we can deliver to the billions of people who use our services.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nDoug, on your second question about how, we expect to finance, the the growing CapEx next year, we certainly expect that we will we will finance, you know, some some large large share of that ourselves, but we're also exploring ways to work with financial partners to co develop data centers. We don't have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large scale data center projects, that are developed using, you know, our ability to build world world class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many different paths.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\n**Justin post** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thank you. I'll ask another one on the infrastructure. Mark, your spend is now approaching some of the biggest hyperscalers out there. Do Do you think of all this capacity mostly for internal uses, or do you think there's a way to share or even come up with a business model where leveraging that capacity for external uses?\n\n**Justin post** (Managing Director)\nAnd then, Susan, when when you think about the the ROI on this CapEx, I'm sure you have internal models. I'm sure you can't share all that. But how are you thinking about the ROI, and are you optimistic about the long term returns? Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nJustin, I can go ahead and and take a crack at both of those. And, obviously, Mark, you should you should feel free to weigh in. You know, right now, we are focused on, ensuring that we have enough capacity for our internal use cases, which includes both all of the core AI work that we do to support the recommendation, engine work on the organic, content side to support all the ads ranking and recommendation work, and then, of course, to make sure that we are building the training capacity that we think we need in order to build frontier AI models, and to make sure that we're preparing ourselves for, the types of inference use cases that we think, you know, might, that we might have ahead of us as we, eventually, you know, focus not only on developing frontier models, but also how we can expand, into the kinds of consumer use cases, that we think will, you know, be hopefully hopefully widely useful and, and engaging for our users. So at present, we're not really thinking about, external use case, external use cases on the infrastructure, but it's a, you know, it it it's it's a good question.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOn your second question, which is really around the sort of ROI on on CapEx, you know, there are a couple things. So, again, on the core AI side, we continue to see strong ROI. Our ability to measure that is quite good, and we feel sort of, you know, very good about the the rigorous measurement and returns that that we see there. On the Gen AI side, we are clearly much, much earlier on the return curve, and we don't expect, that the Gen AI work is going to be a meaningful driver of revenue, you know, this year or, or next year. But we remain, you know, generally very optimistic about the the monetization opportunities that will open up, and Mark spoke to them in his, in his script, the sort of five pillars, I won't repeat them here.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAnd we think that over the medium to long term time frame, those are opportunities that are very adjacent and intuitive, you know, for where our in terms of where our business is today, why they would be big opportunities for us, and that there will be sort of big markets attached, attached to each of them. So, you know, we, again, are also I would say the last thing I would add here is we are building the infrastructure with fungibility in mind. Obviously, there are a lot of things that you have to build up front in terms of the data center, shells, the networking infrastructure, etcetera. But we will be, you know, ordering servers, which ultimately will be the biggest bulk of CapEx spend as we need them, and when we need them, and making sort of the the best decisions at those times in terms of figuring out where the capacity will go to use.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Schmulek with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mark Shmulik** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst - US Internet)\nYes. Thank you for taking my questions. Mark, as you go after the superintelligence vision, especially for those of us on the outside, what are kind of some of the markers or KPIs that you're tracking on whether you're on track and making progress? Is it really against kind of those five pillars you outlined above? Or should we be thinking more broadly?\n\n**Mark Shmulik** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst - US Internet)\nAnd Susan, obviously, AI delivering great ROI today, all those investments, and also building towards kind of longer term goals. Just curious, has there just been any change or adjustment to how you think about the relationship between revenues or core business performance and the cadence of investment? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. In terms of what to look at I mean, what I'm gonna look at internally, the quality of the people on the teams, the quality of the models that we're producing, the rate of improvement of our other AI systems across the company, and and the extent to which the the leading kind of foundation models that we're building contribute to improving all of the other AI systems and and kind of everything that we're doing around the company. Then I think you just get into our standard product and business playbook, which is translating that technology into new products, which will first scale to billions of people, and then over time, we will monetize. But I think that there's there's gonna be some some lag in that. Right?\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd and and that, I think, is is kind of, you know, always the way that that we work as well. You know, whether we're we're building some new social product or or this, you know, something like Meta AI or a new new product around this, it's we're gonna work on on getting to leading scale, building the highest quality product, focus on that for a few years. And then once we're really confident in that position, then we'll focus on ramping up the business around it. So it's I mean, going back to the last question a little bit, it's it's sort of you know, when you compare this business to the some of the cloud businesses, it's like, we do have this delay where we focus on building research and then, doing research and then ramping consumer products, and it often does take, some period of time before we really are ramping up the business around it. I think that that's kind of a known property of our of our business and the cycle around it.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nBut I guess on the flip side, we believe that if you are building superintelligence, you should use all of your GPUs to, make it so that you're, serving your customers really well with that. And and we think that there's gonna be a much higher return that we can do by generating that directly rather than just kind of renting or leasing out the infrastructure at other companies.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nOn the second part of your question, you know, we've said in the past that our primary focus from a profitability perspective is driving consolidated operating profit growth over time. And it won't be linear. In some years, we'll deliver above average profit growth. And in years where we're making big investments, I think we will see that impact the amount of operating profit growth that we can deliver. And at the moment, we see a lot of attractive investment opportunities that we believe are gonna set us up to to to deliver compelling profit growth in the coming years, you know, for all of our investors.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAnd so we're focused on constraining investments elsewhere as we pursue those those investments. But we really believe that, you know, this is a this is a time for us to really make investments in the future of AI as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in addition to strengthen our core business.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ron Josey** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to to ask you on Meta AI, and I think you talked about in the call just growing engagement overall, particularly on WhatsApp. And now we have a billion users on the platform, and and the focus is now on driving personalization. So I wanna understand a little bit more how these next gen models can help drive adoption here, particularly with Behemoth coming online at some point.\n\n**Ron Josey** (Managing Director)\nAnd then as, you know, people are using Meta AI with WhatsApp, you know, thoughts on on search and queries and potentially monetizing that. Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. I'm not gonna get super deep into the road map on this, but the the basic you know, we do see that as we continue improving the the models behind Meta AI and and post training, it just engagement increases. And as we swap in the updated models, when we go from LAMA four to LAMA 4.1, when we have that, we expect that. You know, just the the models are inherently pretty general. So it's yeah.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYou focus on specific areas, but in general, just just sort of gets better at a lot of different things that that people wanna ask it or wanna do with it. And I think with each version, both, like, what we're doing on a week to week basis in terms of continuing to train it and when we drop kind of new generations or or big dot releases of of of each generation, that will improve engagement too. So we're we're focused on that. I'm not gonna go into the specific research areas or or capabilities that we're planning on dropping in the future, but I I you know, obviously, I'm pretty excited about it.\n\n**Ron Josey** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nWe Our last question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n**Youssef Squali** (MD &amp; Head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group)\nGreat. Thank you guys for taking the question. Type two. So, Mark, the ReBand initiative has been a hallmark for you guys so far. Where are we on the development of Glasses as that new computational platform that you've talked about in the past?\n\n**Youssef Squali** (MD &amp; Head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group)\nIs it moving faster or slower than you thought? And as you leverage Meta AI, do do you believe glasses ultimately replace smartphones, or do you need the new form factor that's AI first? And then, Susan, just quickly, how do you guys see SBC progressing over the next couple of years? Is it fair to assume it'll grow materially faster than revenue and OpEx? And how do you minimize shareholder dilution? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. I can talk a bit about the glasses. Yeah. I mean, we're I'm I'm very excited about the progress that I think both the the Ray Ban metas and I'm I'm very excited about the Oakley meta, the the Houstons too and and and other things that that we have planned.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. I mean, this this product category is clearly doing quite well. And I I think it's good for a lot of things. It is stylish eyewear, so people like wearing them just as glasses. It it has a a bunch of interesting functionality, and then the use of Meta AI in them just continues to grow.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd and the percent of people who are using it for that on a daily basis is is increasing, and that's, that's all good to see. I mean, I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, talk to you. Once you get a display, in there, whether it's the kind of wide holographic field of view like we we, showed with Orion or just a smaller display that, might be good for displaying some information, then that's also going to unlock a lot of value where you can just interact with an AI system throughout the day in this multimodal way. It can see the content around you. It can generate a UI for you, show show you information, and and and be helpful.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI mean, I I personally think that, you know, just like you know, if know, I wear contact lenses. I I feel like if I didn't have my vision corrected, I'd be sort of at a cognitive disadvantage going through the world. And I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you're kinda similar. We'd probably be at a, you know, pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people in in who you're who you're working with or competing against. So I think that this is a pretty fundamental form factor.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThere are a lot of different versions of it. Right now, we're building ones that I think are stylish but but aren't focused on the display. I think there's a whole set of different things to explore with displays. This is kind of what we've been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last, you know, five to ten years is basically doing the research on all of these different things. And and it's a it's a you know, I I don't know.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nTen years ago, I would have like, the the other thing that's awesome about glasses is they they are gonna be the the ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together. It's the whole metaverse vision, think, is gonna is going to end up being extremely important too, and AI is gonna accelerate that too. It's just that if you'd asked me five years ago whether we'd have kind of holograms that created immersive experiences or super intelligence first, I think most people would have thought that you'd get the holograms first. And it's this interesting kind of quirk of the tech industry that I think we're gonna end up having really strong AI first. But because we've been investing in this, I think we're just several years ahead on on on building out glasses.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd I think that that's something that we're excited to keep on investing in heavily because I I think it's gonna be a really important part of the the future.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director - IR)\nYoussef, we didn't quite catch your second question. Do you mind just repeating it?\n\n**Youssef Squali** (MD &amp; Head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group)\nSure. Just as you look at the the the the spend on stock based compensation over the next couple of years with all these hires, I'm assuming that that we're gonna see that materially or grow materially faster maybe than revenue and OpEx. And just wanna know how how what you guys are doing to plan to minimize shareholder dilution. Is it mostly buybacks or or anything else? Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nThanks, Youssef. So, I mean, the impact of, you know, the sort of increased compensation costs, including SBC, of our AI hires this year is reflected in the revised 2025 expense outlook and in the twenties the comments I made about sort of the 2026, expense outlook. Those are obviously a big driver of 2026 expense growth as we recognize the full year of compensation for the additional talent we're bringing on. Having said that, you know, we you know, so we've factored that into our sort of expense outlook. Having said that, we certainly, you know, we are very focused on on making sure on keeping an eye on dilution.\n\n**Susan Li** (CFO)\nAnd, you we generally believe that our strong financial position is going to allow us to support these investments while continuing to repurchase shares as part of the sort of buyback program that offsets equity compensation and as well as provide quarterly cash dividend distributions to our investors.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director - IR)\nGreat. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd this call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Kenneth Dorrell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta's first quarter twenty twenty five earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Lee, CFO. Our remarks today will include forward looking statements, which are based on assumptions as of today. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors, including those set forth in today's earnings press release and in our annual report on Form 10 ks filed with the SEC.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.appmeta.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAlright. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We've had a strong start to the year. Our community keeps growing with more than 3,400,000,000 people now using at least one of our apps each day.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOur business is also performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty. The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do. And, you know, as we continue to increase our investments and focus more of our resources on AI, I thought it would be useful today to lay out the five major opportunities that we are focused on. Those are improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices. And these are each long term investments that are downstream from us building general intelligence and leading AI models and infrastructure.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nEven with our significant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making. The first opportunity is improved advertising. Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve, like selling something or getting a new customer, and how much they're willing to pay for each result, and then we just do the rest. Businesses used to have to generate their own ad creative and define what audiences they wanted to reach, but AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd now AI is generating better creative options for many businesses as well. I think that this is really redefining what advertising is into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale. And if we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI, will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today. In just the last quarter, we are testing a new ads recommendation model for Reels, which has already increased conversion rates by 5%, and we're seeing 30% more advertisers are using AI creative tools in the last quarter as well. The second opportunity is more engaging experiences.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThis will come in two forms, better recommendations for existing content types and better new types of content. In the last six months, improvements to our recommendation systems have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and 35% on threads. Threads now, also has more than 350,000,000 monthly actives and continues to be on track to become our next major social app. In addition to better recommendations for existing content types, AI is also enabling the creation of better content as well. Some of this will be helping people produce better content to share themselves.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSome of this will be AI generating content directly for people that is personalized for them. Some of this will be in existing formats like photos and videos, and some of it will be increasingly interactive. I've often talked about this long term trend of content becoming richer over time. Our feeds started mostly with text and then became mostly photos when we all got mobile phones with cameras, and then became mostly video when mobile networks became fast enough to handle that well. We are now in the video era, but I don't think that this is the end of the line.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nIn the near future, I think that we're gonna have content in our feeds that you can interact with and that it'll interact back with you, rather than you just watching it. Over the long term, as AI unlocks more productivity in the economy, I also expect that people will spend more of their time on entertainment and culture, which will create an even larger opportunity to create more engaging experiences across all of these apps. The the third opportunity is business messaging. Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising and feeds on Facebook and Instagram. But WhatsApp now has more than 3,000,000,000 monthly actives with more than a hundred million people in The US and growing quickly there.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nMessenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. So business messaging should be the next pillar of our business. In countries like Thailand and Vietnam, where there is a low cost of labor, we see many businesses conduct commerce through our messaging apps. There's actually so much business through messaging that those countries are both in our top 10 or 11 by revenue even though they're ranked in the thirties in global GDP. This phenomenon hasn't yet spread to developed countries because the cost of labor is too high to make this a profitable model before AI, but AI should solve this.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo in the next few years, I expect that just like every business today has an email address, social media account, and website, they'll also have an AI business agent that can do customer support and sales, and they should be able to set that up very easily given all the context that they've already put into our business platforms. And we're gonna have more to share on upcoming calls about our progress in this area. The fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Across our apps, there are now almost a billion monthly actives using Meta AI. Our focus for this year is deepening the experience and making AI the leading personal AI with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment. I think that we're all gonna have an AI that we talk to throughout the day while we're browsing content on our phones and eventually as we're going through our days with glasses.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd I think that this is gonna be one of the most important and valuable services that has ever been created. In addition to building Meta AI into our apps, we just released our first Meta AI standalone app. It is personalized, so you can talk to it about interests that you've shown while browsing reels or different content across our apps. And we built a social feed into it so you can discover entertaining ways that others are using Meta AI, and initial feedback on the app has been good so far. Over time, I expect that the business opportunity for Meta AI to follow our normal product development playbook.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nFirst, we build and scale the product, and then once it is at scale, then we focus on revenue. In this case, I think that there will be a large opportunity to show product recommendations or ads as well as a premium service for people who want to unlock more compute for additional functionality or intelligence. But I expect that we're gonna be largely focused on scaling and deepening engagement for at least the next year before we'll really be ready to start building out the business here. The fifth opportunity is AI devices, which is increasingly how we are thinking about our work on the next generation of computing platforms. Glasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the metaverse.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThey enable you to let an AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you throughout the day, and they let you blend the physical and digital worlds together with holograms. More than a billion people worldwide wear glasses today, and it seems highly likely that these will become AI glasses over the next five to ten years. Building the devices that that people use to experience our services lets us deliver the highest quality AI and social experiences. And this will serve as an amplifier on all of the opportunities I've mentioned so far as well as unlocking some new opportunities as well. Ray Ban Meta AI glasses have tripled in sales in the last year, and the people who have them are using them a lot.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWe've got some exciting new launches with our partner, SLR Luxottica, later this year as well that should expand that category and add some new technological capabilities to the glasses. On Quest, we are also seeing deeper engagement as Quest three s makes VR accessible to more people, and more people are creating experiences in Horizon with AI tools. Now everything that I've talked about today is built on top of our AI models and our infrastructure. We released the first Llama four models earlier this month, and they are some of the most intelligent, best multimodal, lowest latency, and most efficient models that anyone has built. We have more models on the way, including the massive LAMA four behemoth model.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOverall, we are focused on building full general intelligence. All of the opportunities that I've discussed today are downstream of delivering general intelligence and doing so efficiently. The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I wanna make sure that we're working aggressively and efficiently, and I also wanna make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams that we need to achieve our goals. So to that end, we are accelerating some of our efforts to bring capacity online more quickly this year as well as some longer term projects that will give us the flexibility to add capacity in the coming years as well, and that has increased our planned investment for this year.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nMore broadly, this has been a good start to what I expect will continue to be an intense year. We've got a lot more exciting work in the pipeline that I'm looking forward to sharing soon. I continue to think that this year is gonna be a pivotal moment for our industry, and I am grateful for everyone who is working so hard at the company to deliver all of this amazing technology and new experiences. As always, thank you all for being on this journey with us. And now, Susan.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year over year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $42,300,000,000 up 16% or 19% on a constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $24,800,000,000 up 9% compared to last year.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nIn terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 14% driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of server useful lives. R and D increased 22%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 8% driven mainly by an increase in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity efforts. G and A decreased 34% driven primarily by lower legal related costs. We ended Q1 with over 76,800 employees, up 4% quarter over quarter.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nFirst quarter operating income was $17,600,000,000 representing a 41% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 9% as we recognized excess tax benefits from share based compensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods. Net All expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $13,700,000,000 driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10,300,000,000 We repurchased $13,400,000,000 of our Class A common stock and paid $1,300,000,000 in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $70,200,000,000 in cash and marketable securities and 28,800,000,000 in debt. Moving now to our segment results.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nI'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3,400,000,000 people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q one total Family of Apps revenue was $41,900,000,000 up 16% year over year. Q one Family of Apps ad revenue was $41,400,000,000 up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year over year growth.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in rest of world and North America at 1918% respectively. Europe and Asia Pacific grew fourteen percent and twelve percent. In q one, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 5%, and the average price per ad increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from increased advertiser demand in part driven by improved ad performance.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThis was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of apps other revenue was $510,000,000, up 34%, driven mostly by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our family of apps. In q one, family of apps expenses were $20,100,000,000 representing 81% of our overall expenses. Family of expenses were up 10% mainly due to growth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower legal related expenses.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nFamily of Apps operating income was $21,800,000,000 representing a 52% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, q one revenue was $412,000,000 down 6% year over year due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of Ray Ban Meta AI glasses. Reality Labs expenses were $4,600,000,000 up 8% year over year driven primarily by higher employee compensation. Reality Labs operating loss was $4,200,000,000. Turning now to the business outlook.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThere are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we're focused both on enhancing our core family of apps today and building the next generation of devices and experiences through Reality Labs. I'll start with our family of apps. In the first quarter, we saw strong growth in video consumption across both Facebook and Instagram, particularly in The US where video time spent grew double digits year over year. This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing enhancements to our recommendation systems, and we see opportunities to deliver further gains this year.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nWe're also progressing on longer term efforts to develop innovative new approaches to recommendations. A big focus of this work will be on developing increasingly efficient recommendation systems so that we can continue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models while avoiding diminishing returns. There are promising techniques we're working on that will incorporate the innovations from LLM model architectures to achieve this. Another area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology into our content recommendation systems. For example, we're finding that LLM's ability to understand a piece of content more deeply than traditional recommendation systems can help better identify what is interesting to someone about a piece of content leading to better recommendations.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nWe began testing using LaMa in Thread's recommendation systems at the end of last year given the app's text based content and have already seen a 4% lift in time spent from the first launch. It remains early here, but a big focus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other content types, including photos and videos. We also expect this to be complementary to Meta AI as it can provide more relevant responses to people's queries by better understanding their interests and preferences through their interactions across Facebook, Instagram, and threads. Earlier this year, we began testing the ability for Meta AI to better personalize its responses by remembering certain details from people's prior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps. We are already seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we've rolled it out to, and it is now built into Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and our new standalone MetaAI app in The US and Canada.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nWe're also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content. In q one, we launched a new experience on Instagram in The US that consists of a feed of content your friends have left a note on or liked, and we're seeing good results. We also just launched Blend, which is an opt in experience in direct messages that enables you to blend your Reels algorithm with your friends to spark conversations over each other's interests. These features all lean into Instagram's position at the intersection of entertainment and social connection. WhatsApp remains at its core a private messaging app, but it has evolved to also become a place people come to get updates from accounts they are connected to or follow.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nToday, there are tens of billions of views of status posts on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the updates tab as a place people can go to do more. Creators remain another big focus for us, and we're investing in tools to help them produce the best original content on our platforms. Last week, we launched our standalone edits app, which supports the full creative process for video creators from inspiration and creation to performance insights. Edits has an ultra high resolution short form video camera and includes generative AI tools that enable people to remove the background of any video or animate still images with more features coming soon. Moving to Reality Labs, we're seeing very strong traction with Ray Ban Meta AI glasses with over four times as many monthly actives as a year ago, and the number of people using voice commands is growing even faster as people use it to answer questions and control their glasses.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThis month, we fully rolled out live translations on Ray Ban Meta AI glasses to all markets for English, French, Italian, and Spanish. Now when you are speaking to someone in one of these languages, you'll hear what they say in your preferred language through the glasses in real time. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply across each service to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nWe are also starting to introduce ads on unmonetized services like Threats, which we opened up to all eligible advertisers this month to reach people in over 30 different markets to start, including The US. As we do for any newly monetized surface, we expect to gradually ramp ad supply as we optimize the ad formats and ensure they feel native to the app. We don't expect threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. We're continuing to improve our ad systems by developing new modeling technologies to more efficiently predict the right ad to show.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nIn q one, we introduced our new generative ads recommendation model or JEM for ads ranking. This model uses a new architecture we developed that is twice as efficient at improving ad performance for a given amount of data and compute. This efficiency gain enabled us to significantly scale up the amount of compute we use for model training with JEM trained on thousands of GPUs, our largest cluster for ads training to date. We began testing the new model for ads recommendations on Facebook Reels earlier this year and have seen up to a 5% increase in ad conversions. We're now rolling it out to additional services across our apps.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nOn the ads product side, we're seeing continued momentum with our Advantage Plus suite of AI powered solutions. We've been encouraged by the initial tests of our streamlined campaign creation flow for sales, app, and lead campaigns, which starts with Advantage Plus turned on from the beginning for advertisers. In April, we rolled this out to more advertisers and expect to complete the global rollout later this year. We're also seeing strong adoption of Advantage Plus Creative. This week, we are broadening access of video expansion to Facebook reels for all eligible advertisers, enabling them to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of their existing videos by generating new pixels in each frame to optimize their ads for full screen surfaces.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nWe also rolled out image generation to all eligible advertisers. And this quarter, we plan to continue testing a new virtual try on feature that uses GenAI to place clothing on virtual models, helping customers visualize how an item may look and fit. Last, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure value. One example of this is our incremental attribution feature, which enables advertisers to optimize for driving incremental conversions or conversions we believe would not have occurred without an ad being shown. We're seeing strong results in testing so far with advertisers using incremental attribution in tests seeing an average 46% lift in incremental conversions compared to their business as usual approach.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nWe expect to make this available to all advertisers in the coming weeks. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. Starting with headcount, our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within our company priorities. In the first quarter, the significant majority of the roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance, and Reality Labs.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nOn infrastructure, we have two primary focuses to meet the growing compute needs of our services and AI initiatives. The first way is by significantly scaling up our infrastructure footprint. Our CapEx growth this year is going toward both generative AI and core business needs with the majority of overall CapEx supporting the core. We expect the significant infrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near term, but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver. We continue to build this capacity in a way that grants us maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it to ensure we have the agility to react to how the technology and industry develop in the coming years.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThe second way we're meeting our compute needs is by increasing the efficiency of our workloads. In fact, many of the innovations coming out of our ranking work are focused on increasing the efficiency of our systems. This emphasis on efficiency is helping us deliver consistently strong returns from our core AI initiatives. For example, we shared on the q three twenty twenty four call that improvements to our AI driven feed and video recommendations drove a roughly 8% lift in time spent on Facebook and a 6% lift on Instagram over the first nine months of last year. Since then, we've been able to deliver similar gains in just six months' time with improvements to our AI recommendations delivering 76% time spent gains on Facebook and Instagram respectively.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nBefore moving to our financial guidance, I want to acknowledge the dynamic macro environment and note that our range reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes. We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth and believe the past work we've done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect second quarter twenty twenty five total revenue to be in the range of 42,500,000,000.0 to $45,500,000,000 Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year over year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of 113,000,000,000 to $118,000,000,000 lowered from our prior outlook of $114,000,000,000 to $119,000,000,000 Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year twenty twenty five capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in the range of $64,000,000,000 to $72,000,000,000 increased from our prior outlook of $60,000,000,000 to $65,000,000,000. This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business. On to tax.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 15%. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in The EU and The US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. The European Commission recently announced its decision that our subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the DMA. Based on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of twenty twenty five. We will appeal the commission's DMA decision, but any modifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal process.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nIn closing, this was another solid quarter for our business. We believe the investments we're making across our company priorities will position us well in the coming years to continue delivering engaging services for our community, compelling results for advertisers, and strong business performance. With that, Christa, let's open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n**Brian Nowak** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one's on LAMA. Mark, can you the LLM landscape continues to sort of evolve and be somewhat competitive.\n\n**Brian Nowak** (Managing Director)\nCan you sort of talk us through some of the key areas of advancement you are most focused on and excited about as we sort of think about Behemoth and and next versions of of LAMA to come? And then the the second one on on Meta AI, almost a billion users globally. Any help on sort of how you're seeing US traction there and the types of recurring user behaviors that you're seeing in the early Meta AI use cases? Thanks.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSure. I can talk about the the LLMs. On the Meta AI usage, I'm not sure if we have more stats to share on that now. Yeah. It's I mean, I'll I'll defer to Susan on if there's anything that we're that we're ready on that.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOn the LLM, yeah, there's a lot of progress being made in in a a lot of different dimensions. And the reason why we wanna build this out is, one, is that we think it's important that for for kind of how critical this is for our business that we sort of have control of our own destiny and are not depending on on another company for something so critical. But two, we wanna make sure that we can shape the development to be optimized for our infrastructure and the use cases that we want. So to that end, LAMA four, the shape of the model with 17,000,000,000 parameters per expert was designed specifically for the infrastructure that that we have in order to provide low latency experience to be voice optimized. One of the key things if you're having a voice conversation with AI is it needs to be low latency.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo that way, you know, when you're having a conversation with it, there's no large gap between when you stop speaking and it start and it starts. So everything from the shape of the model to the research that we're doing to the techniques that go into it are are kind of fit into that. Similarly, another thing that we focused on was context window length. And, you know, in some of our models, we have really we're industry leading on context window length. And part of the reason why we think that that's important is because we're very focused on providing a personalized experience.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd there are different ways that you can put personalized personalization context into an LLM, but one of the ways to do it is to include some of that context in the context window. And having a long context window that can incorporate a lot of the background that a person has shared across our apps is one way to do that. So that's like it it kind of is giving you a flavor of the products that we're trying to build and then some specific technical architecture decisions and research prioritization that we basically have made in order to deliver the specific experience that we're going for. I could go on and and add and add a lot more. The reason you know, it's it I think it's also very important to deliver big models like Behemoth, not because we're gonna end up serving them in production, but because of the technique of distilling from larger models.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nRight? The LAMA four models that we've published so far and the ones that we're using internally and, and and some of the ones that we'll build in the future are basically distilled from the Behemoth model in order to, get the, you know, 95% of the intelligence of the large model in a form factor that is much lower latency and much more efficient. So these things are all very important. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to do that kind of distillation, from other closed models. So that that kinda gives you a flavor for for how we're thinking about the development of this.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd and then, of course, the models and the infrastructure that we're building out power all of the the the the opportunities that I mentioned before.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nBrian, I'm happy to answer your second question about Meta AI. You know, the top use case right now for Meta AI from a query perspective is really around information gathering as people are using it to search for and understand and analyze information, followed by social interactions from you know, ranging from casual chatting to more in-depth discussion or debate. We also see people use it for writing assistance, interacting with visual content, seeking help. And we see meta, people engage with Meta AI from several different entry points. WhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our family of apps.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nMost of that WhatsApp engagement is in one on one threads, followed by Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement where we're seeing strong engagement from our feed deep dives integration that lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that's recommended to them. And we're obviously excited about the launch of the Meta AI standalone app.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Eric Sheridan** (Managing Director)\nThanks so much for taking the question. Maybe following up on Brian's question and coming at it from a different angle, I appreciate the color on the use cases you're seeing today for Meta AI. How would you suspect those use cases evolve with a standalone app? Can you bring us into a little bit the decision process to do a standalone app? What that might change in terms of utility, frequency, or scale relative to what you see inside family of apps today?\n\n**Eric Sheridan** (Managing Director)\nAnd how you think about positioning Meta AI as a standalone app against the competitive landscape today of other, stand alone sort of consumer AI apps? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. I can talk about that. We're gonna focus on both integrating it into our family of apps in more ways and building a stand alone experience. You know, I think some people want faster access to it or or a more built out feature set than you can build into an app like WhatsApp. So so the stand alone app will be valuable for that.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI also think that the stand alone app is going to be particularly important in The United States because WhatsApp, as Susan said, is the largest surface that people use that AI in, which makes sense if you wanna text an an AI, having that be closely integrated and a good experience in the messaging app that you use makes a lot of sense. But, you know, we're while we have, you know, more than a hundred million people use WhatsApp in The United States, it we're clearly not the primary messaging app in The United States at this point. IMessage is. We we hope to to become the leader over time, but we're in a different position there than we are in most of the rest of the world on WhatsApp. So, so I think that the Meta AI app as a stand alone is gonna be particularly important in The United States to to establishing leadership in as as the the main personal AI that people use.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nBut we're gonna keep on advancing the experiences across the board in all of these different areas.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\n**Justin post** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thank you. A couple of questions.\n\n**Justin post** (Managing Director)\nJust on the guide in the second quarter, are reports of potential supply issues in e commerce. How you thought about that in the guide and maybe how you're thinking about it for the back half? And then a bigger picture question, you know, your CapEx spend is now close to some hyperscalers with with very big client basis. Just help us conceptualize the kind of ecosystem you're building with your CapEx. I know you gave a lot of help on the intro, but but maybe the ROI works without direct enterprise spend to drive revenues. How how you're thinking about that? Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThanks, Justin. You know, on the q two guide, there's a uncertainty, uncertainty, obviously, in how the macro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different segments of our business. You know, our q two revenue outlook aims to factor that in and partly, that's partly why the $3,000,000,000 range reflects the potential for a wider range of outcomes. Specifically, we have seen some reduced spend in The US from Asia based ecommerce exporters, which we believe is in anticipation of the de minimis exemption going away on May 2. A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nBut our q two outlook, you know, reflects the trends we're seeing so far in April, which have generally been healthy. So it's very early. Hard to know how things will play out over the quarter and certainly, certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year. Your second question, is, is, about why we're investing more in CapEx. And, you know, we really believe that our ability to build world class infrastructure gives us a meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and services over the coming years.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nAnd there are a lot of opportunities also for us to improve our core business, by putting more compute against our ads and recommendation work. So even with the capacity that we're bringing online in 2025, you know, we are having a hard time, meeting the demand that teams have for compute compute resources across the company. So we are going to continually, invest, you know, meaningfully here across our infrastructure footprint, but we are also also really looking to build this capacity in a way that gives us the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over the coming years so we can respond to how the market and technology develop.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Douglas Anmuth** (Managing Director &amp; Internet Analyst)\nThanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow-up on CapEx and infrastructure spending. Just on the higher range for CapEx, can you just help us understand how much of that is tied to the additional data center investments versus the increased hardware costs? And really, what's driving those higher hardware costs? And then separately, there have been some articles suggesting that you've been looking to partner to share some of the costs of the AI infrastructure build out.\n\n**Douglas Anmuth** (Managing Director &amp; Internet Analyst)\nCan you just help us understand your thought process there and some of the pros and cons of going alone versus partnering? Thanks.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThanks, Doug. You know, so our increased CapEx outlook, you know, reflects both of those updates. The increased data center spend this year as we, have made some adjustments to flex our build strategy, that will enable us to really stand up capacity more quickly, both in '25 and '26. We haven't broken down sort of the exact drivers. The higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from, you know, suppliers who source from countries around the world.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nAnd there's just a lot of uncertainty around this given the ongoing, trade discussions. And so that is both reflected in the wider range that we are giving, and we're also working on, you know, on our end on mitigations by optimizing our supply chain, and our outlook is really trying to reflect our best understanding of the potential impact, this year, you know, across all of that uncertainty. On the second part of your question, you know, we are you know, we're pleased to have partners investing alongside us and bringing LAMA to market like AWS and Azure who are helping us host LAMA. We're always looking for opportunities to continue deepening or expanding those partnerships, but we are funding the infrastructure that is being used to train LAMA, and we don't have any expectation that that will change, at this point.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Schmulich with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mark Shmulik** (MD, Senior Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking the questions. Mark, in your conversation last night with Satya, I think you both discussed a bit around, you know, kind of the the portion of code being written internally by AI. Know, kind of back to some of your previous comments around, you know, this being the year where we might see a, you know, AI kind of, the place of a mid level engineer. You know, with the world evolving so quickly, can you share some places where you've seen strong traction there?\n\n**Mark Shmulik** (MD, Senior Analyst)\nAnd, you know, are we progressing kind of faster, slower, or as you expected towards this milestone? And then, Susan, with the expense kind guidance coming down just a touch, how should we think about just the overall cadence of expected spending really as it relates to kind of core business performance and this the realities of the day to day world we're living in? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI can talk about the coding agent work. I I don't think that there's been any real change in our prediction for the the timing of this. So I'd say it's basically still on track for something around a mid level engineer kind of starting to become possible sometime this year, scaling into next year. So I'd expect that, you know, by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are going to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development. So we're focused on that.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nInternally, we're also very focused on building AI agents or systems that can help, you know, run different experiments to increase recommendations across our other AI products that, like, the the the ones that do recommendations across our feeds and things like that. So I I think that, if it works, should just accelerate our progress in in those areas. That's, that's the the basic bet that we're making.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nYour second question, about our lowered expense outlook. You know, really, we are four months into the year. The lowered outlook reflects more refined forecasts, including updated expectations for both employee compensation, as well as some other nonheadcount related operating expenses this year. And that's partially offset by higher expected infrastructure costs related to our increased CapEx outlook as well as, higher expected Reality Labs cost of goods sold. And we've maintained our $5,000,000,000 range just, given the more dynamic operating environment that we're in.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nAnd what I would say is, you know, our investment posture today reflects, you know, the significant opportunities that we see across each of the company and priorities that we're investing in this year. We will obviously continue evaluating depending on how macro conditions more broadly evolve, but we really feel like these are big strategic priorities for us and are critical for us to continue investing in. And in fact, you know, I think one of the aims of our efficiency work over the last two years was to put us in a stronger financial position so that we can continue investing in key priorities through tougher financial cycles.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ross Sandler** (Analyst)\nMark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote presentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your teams, want to or aspire to do are kind of bottlenecked by the AI capacity, which, you know, Susan just talked about earlier, and that even, you know, some of the testing that the ad ranking team wants to run is just getting kinda delayed. So I I guess looking out either, you know, this year, next year, whenever, when do you kinda see some of this, constraint being eased back? And, you know, more broadly, you know, we're kind of three years past the IDFA impact to your business. So where do you, you know, where do you think we are in terms of just the overall improvements to the ad ranking system, the ROI that you guys are able to deliver? And, like, what what inning are we in on that in your opinion? Thank you very much.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nI can take a shot at both of those, and, Mark, you can obviously chime in. On the first question, you know, the cap the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic, both in terms of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity online, but also in terms of the, the demand from different product groups in our company, whether they are in the GenAI teams or whether they're doing more of the core AI work around ranking and recommendations. So both the supply and demand, you know, are quite fluid, and so we don't have a sort of a fixed answer in terms of, you know, when we expect that, that we will sort of have enough supply to meet all demand, but that's something that we are working very hard to alleviate, and it's part of, why we accelerated bringing more data center space online, this year. And, also, we're very focused on increasing the efficiency of our workloads over the course of the year. On our your second question, about, you know, ads performance, ads ranking, you know, we have invested for many years and continue to, invest in driving ad performance improvements.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nYear over year conversion growth remains strong, and in fact, we continue to see conversions grow at a faster rate than ad impressions in q one, so reflecting increased conversion rates. And, you know, ads ranking and modeling improvements are a big driver of overall performance gains. We have a lot of innovations, in model architecture in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages of the ads delivery process to serve more relevant ads to people. We talked about the, introduction of the new, gem ads recommendation model in q one, and we have talked about some of the prior model architecture improvements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. For us, we really, you know, believe first and foremost that advertising is a relative performance game.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nThat's especially important for us because the vast majority of our business is direct response advertising. So we we feel good about how the prior investments are paying off, and we continue to, invest in a lot of different work to, constantly improve our ads ranking and recommendations, performance.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Kenneth Gavroski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ken Gawrelski** (Analyst)\nThank you so much. Two for me, please. First, maybe, Mark, how should we think about the timing of AI capabilities necessary to drive WhatsApp for business adoption in higher cost higher labor, cost labor markets. What is Meta doing to accelerate that adoption? And do you see this as mostly incremental to to SME ad spend that you're already capturing?\n\n**Ken Gawrelski** (Analyst)\nAnd then for Susan, one, What is the revised CapEx outlook for this year for '25 mean about future years? Does it mean anything? Or you talked about this being an acceleration in your revised outlook statement. Should we think about this as a new starting point for the to think about '26 and beyond, or or should we just start fresh in '26 and think about the the needs and and and capacity at that point? Thank you.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nI'm I'm happy to take I'll I'll I'll go ahead and take, both of those. And, Mark, you should feel free to chime in, wherever you, would like. You know, so Mark talked a little bit about our general vision that every business will soon, you know, have an AI, that is an expert on their business for their customers to talk to in the same way that today they've got email and websites, social media presences, etcetera. We are currently testing business AIs with a limited set of businesses in The US, and a few additional countries on WhatsApp, Messenger, and on, ads on Facebook and Instagram. We've been starting with small businesses and focusing first on helping them sell their goods and services with business AIs.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nBut, ultimately, we are working on tools to support businesses at every stage of the customer funnel from lead generation to order management and customer service. And a core area that we're addressing right now is really the ability for businesses to customize and control the agent to achieve the outcome that they want. So we've launched a new agent management experience and dashboard that makes it easier for businesses to train their AI based on existing information on their website or WhatsApp profile or their Instagram and Facebook pages. And we're starting with the ability for businesses to activate AI in their chats with customers. We are also testing business AIs on Facebook and Instagram ads that you can ask about product and return policies or assist you in making, a purchase within our in app browser.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nSo, again, the ultimate vision is to build an experience that serves customers across all of these different services and apps. No matter where you engage with the business AI, it should be one agent that recalls your history and your preferences. And we're hearing encouraging feedback, particularly that adopting these AIs are saving the businesses that we're testing with a lot of time in helping to determine which conversations make sense for them to spend more time on. And then your second question, right, was about 2026 CapEx. You know, infrastructure, as I alluded to earlier, just is a very dynamic planning area, given the continued advances in a in AI.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nAnd also for us, the fact that we continue to find a lot of good, use cases to put capacity toward in our core AI ranking and recommendations work. So I would say it's too early to discuss plans beyond 2025.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n**Youssef Squali** (MD &amp; Head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group)\nGreat. Thank you guys for taking the question. So, Mark, in a world where we, we now have maybe five to 10 chatbots including Meta AI on our smartphones doing virtually the same thing, do do do you think this is a market much like search where the winner takes most, or is it likely to be much more fragmented? But in either case, what would you say are the the top two or three competitive advantages of Meta dot ai? And then, Susan, on the EU decision connection with the DMA, what kind of modifications will you need to make to the apps?\n\n**Youssef Squali** (MD &amp; Head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group)\nAnd can you maybe just help us gauge the potential financial fallout understanding that it may still obviously be too early? Thank you.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. On on Meta AI, I mean, I think that there are going to be a number of different agents that people use just like people use different apps for for different things. I'm not sure that people are gonna use multiple agents for the same exact things, but I I'd imagine that something that is more focused on kind of enterprise productivity might be different from something that is somewhat more optimized for personal productivity, and that might be somewhat different from something that is optimized for for entertainment and and social connectivity. So and then there will be there will be different experiences. One of the trends that I think we're starting to see now is personalization across of the across these.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYou know, right now, if the experience is unpersonalized, then you can kinda just go to different apps and get, you know, reasonably similar answers to different questions. But once an AI starts getting to know you and what you care about and context and can build up memory from the conversations that you've had with it over time, I think that will start to become somewhat more of a differentiator. So that's one thing that we think will matter. And then, of course, there's all the different modalities, being able to not just answer questions about in text, but being able to do voice and multimodal and be able to produce images and videos and understand all those things and have good conversations about that, I think, is gonna be important overall. So, yeah, I mean, I think Meta AI is is well positioned, but we have a lot of work to do in order to make it the leading personal AI.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nAnd, Youssef, on your second second question, you know, it is really too early to speak about what those changes could be because we are in the process of engaging with the European Commission. I think maybe the most, useful sort of metric I could give you is just that our advertising revenue in the European economic area in Switzerland, which would be the geographies impacted here, was 16% of our worldwide total revenue in 2024. Again, we are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter's call.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nChrista, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Operator**\nYour last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mark Mahaney** (Senior Managing Director)\nThanks. I'll just throw in two. I think you called out that the China based retailers is one sort of at some potentially soft advertising vertical. Anything else you'd call out? And I would just suggest autos.\n\n**Mark Mahaney** (Senior Managing Director)\nWas that an area of any softness? And then on the Reality Labs and on the losses associated with Reality Labs, they've been very consistent, whatever, 4,000,000,000 a quarter for quite some time. Is there is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there reason to think? Is there is there factor that that would occur that would cause those losses to come down?\n\n**Mark Mahaney** (Senior Managing Director)\nAnd when would that be? But but maybe more importantly, what what is gonna cause those losses to come down? Thank you very much.\n\n**Susan Li** (Chief Financial Officer)\nMark, let me take your first question about, other verticals. You know, we generally saw healthy growth in most verticals, in q one. We did see some weakness in gaming and politics. So year over year growth in gaming was negative, in q one as we lapped a period of strong spend from China based advertisers that were promoting a larger volume of game titles in q one of twenty twenty four. And then year over year growth in the government and politics vertical dropped sharply as expected with the conclusion of of US of US elections, and but that continues to just be a very small, small vertical overall. And then your your second question on Reality Labs.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThe Reality Labs one. I mean, we're we're basically focused on doing the work more efficiently, but as the AI glasses have really taken off, I've talked about this on a number of calls, There are more investments that that I think makes sense to to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very quickly. I mean, some of the if you look at the some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, you know, they're they're often selling, you know, 10,000,000 units and scaling from there. And, you know, I'm not sure if we're gonna do exactly that, but I think that that's, like, the ballpark of the opportunity that we have. And, and that's something that I think we're we're kind of focused on on scaling to that and then scaling beyond that for the generations after that.\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** (Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo I I think some of the the, effort that we're that we're doing is going to we're gonna get more efficient in some parts of the work that we do, but then as a bunch of the products start to hit and start to to grow even bigger than than than and the the number that I just said is just sort of like the sort of a near term milestone, then, you know, then then I think we'll we'll continue scaling in in terms of distribution. And then at some point, just like the other products that we we build out, we will feel like we're at a sufficient scale that we're gonna primarily focus on making sure that we're monetizing and building an efficient business around it. But but that's kinda where we're at on it. We're we're we're definitely focused on doing the work more efficiently, but also very optimistic about what we're seeing in the results, especially on the AI glasses side.\n\n**Kenneth Dorell** (Director of Investor Relations)\nGreat. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Excuse me. And we look forward to speaking to you again soon.",
