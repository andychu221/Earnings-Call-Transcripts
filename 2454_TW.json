Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, David. And now I would like to turn the call to CEO, Dr. Rick Tsai, for our prepared remarks.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter revenue reached TWD 150.2 billion, which came in at the high end of our guidance range. Thanks to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and better demand for smart edge products. For full year 2025, MediaTek's revenue was TWD 596 billion, up 12.3% year-over-year, or TWD 19.1 billion, up 15.6% year-over-year, registering another year of record revenue. I believe this milestone underscores MediaTek's resilience in navigating a dynamic global economic environment. The strong support and confidence from our customers and partners, and the strength of our leading technology and IP roadmap, that has laid the foundation for our growth.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMediaTek's 2025 revenue growth was mainly driven by global share gains of our flagship and premium Dimensity chips, as well as our industry-leading connectivity solutions, including Wi-Fi 7, 5G modem, and 10G-PON. We stand firmly as a market share leader across many categories, such as smartphone, tablets, Chromebook, TV, and broadband connectivity. Meanwhile, we continued to make very solid progress in technology development and business expansion into new growth areas.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFor example, we were one of few companies completing 2nm tape out at TSMC. We worked with partners to enable the world's first Release 19, 5G-Advanced NR NTN connection over OneWeb LEO satellite. We successfully expanded our project pipeline for data center ASIC and automotive platforms. We also started to register revenue for high performance computing products, such as GB10, that we co-developed with NVIDIA, for its DGX Spark AI supercomputers.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nLooking ahead to 2026, as ubiquitous AI continues to push the boundary of more efficient computation and AI applications, we believe MediaTek will continue to thrive on those growth opportunities. In data center, demand has been increasing rapidly. We are very confident in achieving data center ASIC revenue of more than $1 billion in 2026, and multiple billion US dollars in 2027.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFurthermore, we're fully committed to executing a follow-on project in our pipeline, with revenue starting in 2028. For MediaTek, to strengthen our position as a trusted partner for data center customers, we are accelerating investments on several key fronts. Firstly, we have consolidated internal R&D resources and increased external hires for data center, AI system architecture, critical IP development, and advanced technologies. With these efforts, we have demonstrated strong capabilities in architecting high-performance heterogeneous compute systems on advanced process nodes.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAs well as implementing advanced packaging technologies that deliver meaningful PPA improvements and enhance power density for custom data center solutions. In addition, to support our long-term growth and capture emerging market opportunities, we continue to invest in several key technologies, including high-speed 400G SerDes, co-packaged optics solutions, 3.5D packaging, custom HBM, and integrated voltage regulators, IVR. We believe these strategic investments will further enhance our technology roadmap to support customers' evolving requirements.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn automotive, our scalable Dimensity Auto Cockpit platforms, telematics solutions, and power IC continue to gain share globally. In addition, we are making an inroad into ADAS by partnering with DENSO, one of the world's leading automotive technology providers, to co-develop custom ADAS chips. The solution will combine Denso's automotive-grade safety expertise and deep vehicle integration.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWith MediaTek's, our efficient high performance SoCs and AI capabilities to offer a scalable platform for next generation driver assistance. We expect significant revenue growth from our automotive solutions in 2026. Our computing solutions, which includes tablet, Chromebook, and the GB10 project for DGX Spark, that we collaborate with NVIDIA, grew more than 80% in 2025 to $1 billion, driven by strong AI adoption and share gains. We have observed very positive feedback for NVIDIA's DGX Spark, and we expect its revenue growth to accelerate into 2026. With AI serving as a catalyst for industry expansion and driving the surge in demand, the global supply chain is facing challenges in fully meeting the increasing needs in 2026, resulting in higher costs across the supply chain. We have secured the capacity required to support MediaTek's growth in data center ASIC and other areas.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe will also adjust our prices to reflect the rising supply chain cost and allocate our supply across products based on the overall profitability. We believe 2026 will continue to be a year where MediaTek's business growth is supported by the AI mega trend. Building on this solid foundation, we will continue to invest in critical technologies, including 5G satellite, 6G advanced process nodes, and advanced packaging for both edge AI and cloud AI solutions to capture growth opportunities ahead. With that, now let me talk about the recent business performance for our three revenue groups. Our fourth quarter Mobile Phone revenue grew 18% quarter-over-quarter and 8% year-over-year in NTD, achieving record high quarterly revenue and accounting for 59% of total revenue.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThis was driven by the successful ramps of our flagship SoC, Dimensity 9500, as well as our premium SoC, Dimensity 8500. For the year 2025, MediaTek's Mobile Phone business grew 8% year-over-year in US dollar, surpassing $10 billion in revenue and achieving a record high. Within this, flagship SoCs exhibited robust growth and contributed $3 million in revenue.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThese results strongly demonstrate the widespread recognition and market position that MediaTek Dimensity platform has successfully established. For 2026, under the pressure of increasing memory and BOM costs, we expect overall smartphone and demand to be negatively impacted. We will work closely with our customers to strategically adjust the product portfolio in order to mitigate the impact. For the first quarter of 2026, we expect Mobile Phone revenue to decline significantly quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to Smart Edge Platforms.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn the fourth quarter, this group declined eight quarter-over-quarter and grew 13% year-over-year in NTD, accounting for 37% of total revenue. The sequential decline was due to consumer electronics seasonality, whereas the year-over-year growth was mainly driven by share gains in high-end tablets, powered by our Dimensity 8000 and 9000 series. In 2025, Smart Edge Platforms grew 21% year-over-year in US dollars, benefiting from market's continuous adoption of AI and faster connectivity, as well as our global share gains. For example, our connectivity revenue grew strongly and exceeded $3 billion in 2025. With Wi-Fi 7 revenue tripling and the 5G modem doubling. We anticipate these positive trends to extend into 2026.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nEven without factoring in the expected data center ASIC revenue, our Smart Edge Platforms revenue is still expected to grow healthily this year, demonstrating the structured strength across our business portfolio. In 2026, in addition to the exciting growth opportunities from data center, auto, and computing that I mentioned earlier, we also expect higher adoption of AI and faster connectivity to continue across applications.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe are once again at the forefront of technology upgrades with our industry-leading Wi-Fi 8 solutions unveiled at CES this year, and we expect early customer adoptions towards the end of the year. For the first quarter of 2026, we expect our smart edge products to grow sequentially and year-over-year, as several products, such as connectivity, TV, and computing devices, recover from the low seasonality.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMoving on to Power IC, this group accounted for 5% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and was down 8% quarter-over-quarter and 11% year-over-year. The sequential decline is due to consumer electronics seasonality, while automotive and industrial grew in the quarter. In the first quarter of 2026, we expect our IC revenue to be flattish. Moving to the guidance. In the first quarter of 2026, we expect the recovery of Smart Edge Platforms will partially offset the sequential decline of Mobile Phones.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe further expect our first quarter revenue to be in the range of TWD 141.2 billion-TWD 150.2 billion, flat to decline 6% sequentially and down 2%-8% year-over-year, at a forecasted exchange rate of TWD 31.2 to $1. Gross margin is forecasted at 46%, ±1.5 percentage points. Quarterly operating expense ratio to be at 31%, ±2 percentage points. In closing, we believe 2026 will be a year where MediaTek's business growth is supported by the AI mega trend. Meanwhile, we aim to protect our profitability through disciplined pricing and strategic capacity allocation. We will also remain fully focused on execution and collaborate closely with our global supply chain partners. With the vast opportunities brought by ubiquitous AI ahead, we firmly believe we are on the right track of our mid to long-term growth journey. This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Rick. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A session. May we please have the first question?\n\n**Operator**\nYes. And ladies and gentlemen, we are now in Q&A session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star key and one on your telephone keypad, and please ask your questions after your name is announced. And please limit your questions to two at a time, to allow more participants to join the discussion. And after two questions, we will move to the next caller.\n\n**Operator**\nShould you have more questions, please press star key and one again to come back to the queue. And to cancel your questions, just simply press star key and two. As a reminder, it is greatly appreciated that you turn off the speakerphone mode of your device to prevent possible echo effect. We thank you for your cooperation. Now, please press star key and one if you would like to ask questions. Thank you.The first one to ask question, Sunny Lin from UBS.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So to kick off, first question on Cloud ASIC. In recent few months, Cloud ASIC demand appeared to continue to strengthen. So with that, should we expect upside for your total addressable market estimate of $50 billion by 2028, and your market share target of 10%-15%?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI believe we shared about $50 billion last time, and 10%-15% market share. We do not have a really formal estimate, re-estimate of this market size, but I certainly believe to it, it's safe to go up by $20 billion, for instance, about $50 billion-$70 billion. I think that's without really a detailed analysis, but that's my estimate. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nRight. Well, so sorry, just to clarify, given people really pay attention to your guidance. And so let's say if addressable market is up to $70 billion in 2028, and you're still in for a 10%-13% type of market share, or you think could be higher given the progress made in recent few months?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think in 2028, to tell the truth, a bit farther. We have ideas, but I think, let me say 10%-15% is rather safe, estimate. We certainly strive to go higher.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nGot it. And then my second question is to follow up on the business model for core ASIC. And so maybe one is, David, if you could help us understand going to 2027, when you scale the ASIC shipment, how should we think about the incremental OpEx increase? And given now we are into the ramp, could you also give us an update on gross margin, also OP margin profile, for the project?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI'll probably start with the OpEx. I think OpEx ratio, in which is scaled into the revenue so far for the full year, also for next year, I think we are looking for the flattish. Okay? The ratio should be similar. Given the fact the revenue will grow, so the OpEx dollar will continue to increase. We will basically invest more, like, I think Rick, our CEO, explained we're gonna invest more for all key technologies. Profitability-wise, I think that's the same approach. I think overall, due to the mix of different, business model and also accounting principle, the better way to think about that, especially for 2027, when we start to ramp, is you're gonna see, operating margin accretive. I think that's probably the best way to think about that. Yeah.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you. Sorry, maybe one last follow-up. Since you mentioned you have already secured the next generation, called ASIC project, how should we think about your value add, your content, and then also competition, evolving, into the next generation? Thank you very much.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWell, the next generation product certainly is quite a bit more complex in just about every aspect. And we have demonstrated our capability to elevate our technology and IP capabilities convincingly to our customer. And also on top of that, our execution capability, which we are already demonstrating right now in our first chip situation. So I really believe, together with our what we've been discussing before, our hybrid model with flexibility, with a tremendous service to our customers, I think all these add up to a tremendous value add to our customers for their build-up of their very massive compute power development. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nThank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Now, next one to ask question, Laura Chen, Citi. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYes. Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. My question is also about ASIC. Thank you, Rick, for the update on the promising outlook. We are already working on the next generation project. Can you share with us, is there any change in terms of business model? Like, we now are mainly doing studies and also the turnkey service for our client. Since, Rick, you just mentioned that the design is getting more complex, will the business model change involve more IPs that MediaTek will be able to provide? And also, as we are targeting like a 10%-15% of the market share. Can we kind of assume that this business will be able to achieve like a 20% or higher of our total revenues in next year?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAll right. The business model, I think we remain, as I said, our hybrid business model. The value add, you know, of course, will vary from generation to generation, but I'd like to also say, given the high degree of complexity which is added to the next generation chip, we are providing, I think, actually more value. If you look at the total, while our customers is also adding more value in their aspect. So that's why we have been always said, this is a win-win model. We get more value, they get more value, and together they will certainly gain more market share in their end of the business. So I'm very pleased with that development. As to the 2027, good year. What was the question?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nQuestion will be for, yeah, 20% of the-\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYeah, I guess 20% or higher revenue contribution.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOf course, I think you're asking for really event or indication, I guess, for 2027 revenue. I think it's possible, certainly. I think 20% is something we believe we have reasonable chance to get to, and we'll do our very best to achieve that.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYeah, sure. Thank you. Maybe just quick follow-up, as I recall, that we are also working with NVIDIA on NVLink Fusion. So, are we also seeing that any, like, a progress on the potential engagement with our ASIC business?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe model, the NVLink Fusion model, is, is being developed. This is. Again, this model by itself is a complex model, from technical point of view and from business, development point of view. I would say, we continue to have a very strong and a close relationship with NVIDIA, and we both are building the model. The build model and the targeted, potential, customers, and I cannot really disclose too much more, but it's ongoing. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYeah. Okay, sure. No problem. My next question is about the gross margin outlook. I recall last time, David, you mentioned that the gross margin for flagship smartphone SoC seems to be lower than corporate average. So I'm just wondering that, actually we see that the component price hike has more impact on the entry level or low-end segmentation. And the portion of our flagship on the good side is that the, probably the revenue will be able to kind of support it to compensate the weakness in the low-end space. But how would the impact on the gross margin side, and how should we think about the gross margin trends in this year?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for full year 2026, our goal is actually to aim to sustain our growth margin at around 46% level, which was similar to the guidance we gave our, starting from our last quarter. You know, when you look at our, our growth margin fourth quarter last year and also the guidance this year, I think you can consider that will be our goal to maintain at full year. And, how do we achieve that? I think, like what we've explained during the opening remark, given the overall supply chain tightness right now, I think we've been going through a very rigid about the, the capacity allocation among the business growth rate and also the profitability, and that's point number one.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nPoint number two, given the overall, the cost increase in pressure, we are also in discussion with our customer. For certain product, I guess we have to pass on some of the cost increase. So combined of that, I think we'll be reasonable, but the goal will be maintain the growth margin around 46% for the full year.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you. Very helpful.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First off, on the data center ASIC project, could you talk a little bit about your understanding of what you are facing from a competitive landscape perspective? Because this has been largely the domain of one vendor until very recently for this project. And also, Rick, could you kind of help us understand a little bit on the technology preparation that you've done on high-speed SerDes, including 400G plus, 3.5D and CPO? Can you give us a little bit more details on how we can look at MediaTek's capabilities? Because that seems to be quite critical for the next generation, the follow-on project that you mentioned.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYeah. Goku, I mean, I guess your first part of the question is if you're asking whether how we view other suppliers, our policy is not to comment on competitors' situation. But on the other hand, for our own investment, the multiple technologies and IP areas I mentioned, I discussed during the remarks. And then we have staffed through internal resource consolidation. We have many very capable engineers. While we hire high caliber technologies, including architects, including a power expert, including optics expert. Yeah, those are very difficult technologies. We certainly know that because we're doing them. But we also. Oh, by the way, we're also collaborating with some third party major third party players.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nSo, while they remain challenged, very challenging for us, but if you look at the past two plus years, I think our track record has shown that we have been able to not only catch up, but also to provide level playing field capabilities for our next generation. We will continue to compete for future and a broader range of business opportunities. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nJust to follow up, so this current project that is going into production pretty soon this year, do you think that the deployment model is going to be different compared to previously that you were working on some different workload compared to what your competitor is working on? I'm just asking because so far, if you look at data center AI, most of the demand has been largely at the very high end of the spectrum, whether it is for NVIDIA GPUs or AI ASICs. So just wanted to understand, is there like a very big division of workload that is happening at the customer, which gives you this opportunity to kind of break in and kind of for the customer also to segment the demand more clearly?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWell, basically, Goku, this question of course needs to be answered by our customer. I'm sure you understand the pace of the ASIC chips of such complexity. You know, you have to go back certain amount of years to start when you started the design, and then you look at the progress or the status of the AI or generative AI at that time. Then during through that design process into the production, as you know, again, we're measuring in. I wouldn't say I cannot say exactly how many years, but you know well. Things change, but we believe the design of our customers ASIC chips they have taken into consideration of their own internal workloads needs, plus their external requirement workloads. But I cannot say how they balance those workloads. But we have, as far as I understand, they really are very high on this chip. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Just one last question on flagship smartphone. Given we are expecting a tough market for smartphones, are we still expecting the flagship segment to grow this year, or we think we might have to give up some opportunities in to protect the profitability?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nGoku, I think from the market share perspective, flagship market share perspective, given our new product coming out every year and also all new product are very competitive, I think we still feel comfortable the market share will continue to gain. And likewise, actually, because right now is the more second content in there, we're also seeing generation after generation, the blended ASP, generation after generation, the higher. But the last variable, if you like, really the overall shipment, I have to say, given the overall, the memory situation right now is still evolving or developing. Based on what we see, probably that will become somewhat, year-over-year, having some pressure on the flagship overall, the market shipment, not the market share. At least we can somehow balance that with our continued gain on market share and also continue, you know, aggression on our ASP.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Hao Liu from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nYes. Thanks, Rick, Dave, and David and Jessie, for taking my questions, and congrats on the solid results and guidance. So I want you to follow up on the smartphone business. Would you provide more detail about the smartphone linearity for this year, affecting your guidance for a significant decline in first quarter?\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nAnd from the full year perspective, it is going to see negative impacts from the other component supply shortage. Just wondering if you have any quantitative outlook for the overall market versus your own shipment. And then, your overall situation across the mid, high, low-end smartphones, as you are reallocating or optimizing your product mix. Could you also just share your view on the market share gain or loss, as the previous questions? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. Some of the, some of your questions involve a detailed resolution, probably I won't be able to comment. But let me probably start with our full year view for smartphone. Very straightforward, I think given the overall memory situation and we believe actually the overall smartphone this year, year-over-year, maybe we're seeing a decline. I think that's on the top line. In terms of the detailed resolution for flagship, mainstream, entry-level, even including 4G, we probably won't be able to provide the detail. But the key point is, when you look at our overall business portfolio, our non-smartphone business, like we explained during the opening remark, will offset, you know, big part of that and will grow, you know, nicely.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nPlus, our data center new revenue coming in, which right now we guide is more than TWD 1 billion. I think overall, we're still looking for the top line year-over-year growth. I think that's the, probably that's our feedback. But for the detail segmentation resolution, we'll, in general, we don't comment that.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nOkay. Okay. Yes, that's clear. And then, I think just on ASIC and beyond hyperscaler accelerators, should we expect your ASIC business to grow, beyond this part of the market? For example, like server CPUs and also networking chipsets and beyond cloud AI computing. Could you also discuss more in detail about your potential in automotive ADAS partnership with DENSO? Because that is going to be a huge chunk of opportunity with, higher level, ADAS being adopted across the vehicles. And then, I think, as part of my second question is that you also mentioned about you are going to put more effort in 5G satellite. Could you discuss more in detail on what kind of chipsets you are working on with your customers, or is it going to be part of your effort in low Earth orbit? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. About data center AI, of course, now and, our first priority and focus remain at the, what we're going to ship, this year, next year, and also the next project, following... But in the meantime, we are diligently working on the market. But the AI market is just changing very, very fast, every monthly, every quarter, for sure. So we are rapidly adapting that dynamics. That's why we are investing in technology that is not just for one customer. We are developing technology which are generic, more generic also, for other applications, where, like, inferencing is getting a lot more important, as the GenAI development is has gone. So the answer is, we are, but I do not. You know, I don't think we can share a lot more than that. On the other new business, satellite. You have. You asked automotive and satellite?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAutomotive, certainly, we are very excited to work with Denso. I mean, we all know this is one of the top automotive Tier 1 player. Very deep technology capability and very strong business relations with multiple major car OEMs. So the combination between the two companies is just perfect. They provide the deep vehicle integration, understanding all the safety requirements. We provide the low power, and so we see very high performance, plus a very high AI capability that the ADAS will need for the next, at least four or five years. So we're excited, and I believe our--they are too. We look forward to major revenues from both. Satellite, now we actually, we both work on the NTN.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFrom modem point of view, we also actually have a Wi-Fi solution for some of the base stations on Earth for the satellite business. So this is one area that we feel very good. We cannot say. We believe they're fast growing, but we don't, we cannot say how fast so far. But from whatever we are seeing, our connectivity solutions from both modem and Wi-Fi point of view, we have very strong position already, and we expect to grow on that basis.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nOkay, yeah. Thank you so much. That's very clear. Just one small follow-up, and I will be back in the queue. Is that, for that NTN projects or the satellite chips that you have, is it going to be more on the edge side or more going to be on the infrastructure or base station side? And then, I think a couple of years ago, you provided a few that cater for the next few years on the sales and also margins. I'm not sure if you are able to provide such guidance at this stage for 2026 and also 2027. Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for the NTN is more on the edge side, not on the satellite side, I think just to be clear. In terms of the guidance, we probably won't be able to provide guidance so far because there will still be a few years to come. It's growing, but still be a few years to come.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nGot it. Thanks so much. Back to you, David.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my question, and also congratulations for a very strong outlook, especially on the ASIC side. So I do have a two-part questions. One is also about ASIC, and the second question will be on Spark. For the ASIC, I wanted to mention whether you see strengths over the past month, meaning there's an upside to your forecast, especially next year. And if that's the case, you just mentioned you already assured the key components, but are you sure that your TSMC HBM can really support that so-called upside order?\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nAnd lastly, gross margin trend. I'm wondering for those kind of upside revenue, do you think the gross margin, incremental gross margin would decline? And lastly, given the revenue size is so big, do you think the customer want to change to the COT model in the current generation or next generation? So that's my questions about ASIC business.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe are, as we said in our remarks, we are very confident for our fourth quarter revenue of more than $1 billion. We said for 2027, it's multiple billion dollars. That's the range, certainly. I would say we are, we believe if, and whether I believe we will, when we deliver, when we execute, there's we expect to see some upside.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nOkay.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThen the supply, from supply point of view, and I also said earlier that we have secured supplies for data center ASIC needs and some other areas. We have a good scale to work with the major suppliers, and we also have certain flexibility among our own different product portfolio. So we also have high confidence that we can manage, we can provide the supplies for the demand coming next year. We have been preparing for that for some time.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nLastly, again, that question is not really up to us, but again, as I said earlier, I really believe, I think all depends on overall objectives. The overall objectives, I believe our customers, or actually for that matter, all the CSPs, is really to provide timely and high quality, low power computing capability at a very good TCO to grow their business. And, as the market is changing so fast, the technology pace is so fast, if you look at the history of our industry, usually it would take partners to work together to achieve that required growth target for everyone. But unless you are in a very mature industry, you probably can go just by yourself, but we are not in that phase at all. There is a huge amount of growth ahead of us.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI fully believe that the value add we provide, and we are also, as I said earlier, working hard with our customers to enhance their value add. It's not a zero-sum game, period. We believe this will continue. Thank you.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nYep. Yep, that makes a lot of sense, Rick. So just a small follow-up on ASIC side before I move to smartphone. So you mentioned about your you feel like your 10%-15% market share is pretty safe to achieve, right? And my understanding is that your customers ASICs probably account for half or even more of the kind of a total ASIC TAM, right? So is that right way to think about your allocation from these key customers would be like 20%-30% or even higher? Yeah, based on those data points that I just described.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nCharlie, I think, again, so the earlier question talked about sort of target market shares or the market share goal is 2028. You know, this is still a few years away, so there are so many moving targets. I think our folks right now, if we ask them well about the two projects on hand, and market share will become, hopefully a happy consequence. Okay? So that's why actually we don't want to give out the detail. Actually, we will not be able to give out the detailed guidance for the market share for 2028.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nGot you. Thanks, David. So my second question on smartphone will be relatively brief. I wanted to get management's thought about the agentic AI in China smartphone markets. What do you think about this Doubao such kind of feedback and our media and customers want to do similar kind of application. When do you think that they will become a killer app? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think we've been dealing with this question, so for at least two years, if not longer.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYeah.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI will not give you a kind of a boilerplate answer. It's not obvious, this “killer app,” but I don't think—I'm not sure that's the right thinking. I think the agentic AI will just blend into your life with the smartphone, and that smartphone can be a very smart smartphone, or it can... And it may be just a mid-end, because you can, depending on what you need, you can access very sophisticated GenAI models on your phone, but for even more bigger applications, you need to go to the cloud. So it's we provide solution that will have more than sufficient compute power, but that compute power will be limited by the form factor of the phone itself. That's physics.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nSo the phone will provide ample AI or GenAI or agentic AI capability by itself, but and I believe the demand of the application will increase so much, and that phone certainly will play the other role of being just connecting to the cloud very effectively, efficiently, and that will fill both ends. I think it's a part of life. And there may be other form of devices that will provide, that will enhance people's life using agentic AI. And we certainly, if there is opportunity or outlook, we are pursuing them also. Thank you.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nThank you. Thanks. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, David.\n\n**Operator**\nLadies and gentlemen, with the interest of time, we are going to take the last one to ask question. Arthur Lai from Macquarie. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Division Director)\nHi. Hi. Thanks, Rick and David and Jessie, for taking my question. So my first question, still on the cloud AI. Just want to follow up on Charlie's question. When you comment the scale and also flexibility, can you help investors understand, are you trying to allocate the, the skill city resources to incubate your new cloud business? And what's the, the resources you refer to? Is it the wafer location, or is it subtrade or your experienced engineer? Thank you. That's my first question.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nArthur, David here. I think, long story short, we will allocate amount or what you say, internal R&D resource, like during the opening remark. I think Rick's talking about we've been investing sizable R&D and plus we've been hiring aggressively external resource. So internal resource, I think we will definitely allocate to this, you know, fast-growing area, especially with the huge addressable market. For the overall manufacturing capacity, I mean, we will put a priority on that as well. So all of that, yeah.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Division Director)\nOh, thank you. The second question is more on the cycle and also history. This is actually not the first time we envisioned the subtleties of the smartphone. Compared to the last two cycles, can management or Rick comment on what the MediaTek's strategy right now, compared to the previous second down cycle? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. Certainly 2026 is a tough year for smartphone. I'm sure you, you guys have read about that. No need to further elaborate. But I also believe this is a cyclical year. The demand will remain solid next year or maybe 1.5 years. I cannot say for sure, but I am quite sure the demand will come back. And when it come back, when it comes back, it will come back in force, and we need to be prepared for that, and we will be. MediaTek during the past few years we have I think developed, equipped ourselves to...\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think, well, to live through the cycle is too weak actually, or to actually, I believe we will be stronger after the cycle. The capability we're building, the market position, I feel very confident. The mobile business, well, at the, well, it's now in the sixth year of the 5G generation, where certainly the growth, overall growth is saturating. We all know that. But the MediaTek's position, the capability, is much, much stronger compared to our last generation of modem technology. I don't like this down cycle, but that's life, and we will be better after that. Thank you.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Division Director)\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOkay, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for all your questions. I'll hand it over now to Ms. Jessie Wang for closing comments. Ms. Wang, please go ahead.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes MediaTek 2025 fourth quarter conference call, and an audio replay will be available in one hour after the call at the Investor section of MediaTek's website. We would like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\n**Operator**\nYes. Once again, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect now. Goodbye.",

Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, David. And now I would like to turn the call to CEO, Dr. Rick Tsai, for our prepared remarks.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter revenue reached TWD 150.2 billion, which came in at the high end of our guidance range. Thanks to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and better demand for smart edge products. For full year 2025, MediaTek's revenue was TWD 596 billion, up 12.3% year-over-year, or TWD 19.1 billion, up 15.6% year-over-year, registering another year of record revenue. I believe this milestone underscores MediaTek's resilience in navigating a dynamic global economic environment. The strong support and confidence from our customers and partners, and the strength of our leading technology and IP roadmap, that has laid the foundation for our growth.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMediaTek's 2025 revenue growth was mainly driven by global share gains of our flagship and premium Dimensity chips, as well as our industry-leading connectivity solutions, including Wi-Fi 7, 5G modem, and 10G-PON. We stand firmly as a market share leader across many categories, such as smartphone, tablets, Chromebook, TV, and broadband connectivity. Meanwhile, we continued to make very solid progress in technology development and business expansion into new growth areas.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFor example, we were one of few companies completing 2nm tape out at TSMC. We worked with partners to enable the world's first Release 19, 5G-Advanced NR NTN connection over OneWeb LEO satellite. We successfully expanded our project pipeline for data center ASIC and automotive platforms. We also started to register revenue for high performance computing products, such as GB10, that we co-developed with NVIDIA, for its DGX Spark AI supercomputers.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nLooking ahead to 2026, as ubiquitous AI continues to push the boundary of more efficient computation and AI applications, we believe MediaTek will continue to thrive on those growth opportunities. In data center, demand has been increasing rapidly. We are very confident in achieving data center ASIC revenue of more than $1 billion in 2026, and multiple billion US dollars in 2027.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFurthermore, we're fully committed to executing a follow-on project in our pipeline, with revenue starting in 2028. For MediaTek, to strengthen our position as a trusted partner for data center customers, we are accelerating investments on several key fronts. Firstly, we have consolidated internal R&D resources and increased external hires for data center, AI system architecture, critical IP development, and advanced technologies. With these efforts, we have demonstrated strong capabilities in architecting high-performance heterogeneous compute systems on advanced process nodes.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAs well as implementing advanced packaging technologies that deliver meaningful PPA improvements and enhance power density for custom data center solutions. In addition, to support our long-term growth and capture emerging market opportunities, we continue to invest in several key technologies, including high-speed 400G SerDes, co-packaged optics solutions, 3.5D packaging, custom HBM, and integrated voltage regulators, IVR. We believe these strategic investments will further enhance our technology roadmap to support customers' evolving requirements.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn automotive, our scalable Dimensity Auto Cockpit platforms, telematics solutions, and power IC continue to gain share globally. In addition, we are making an inroad into ADAS by partnering with DENSO, one of the world's leading automotive technology providers, to co-develop custom ADAS chips. The solution will combine Denso's automotive-grade safety expertise and deep vehicle integration.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWith MediaTek's, our efficient high performance SoCs and AI capabilities to offer a scalable platform for next generation driver assistance. We expect significant revenue growth from our automotive solutions in 2026. Our computing solutions, which includes tablet, Chromebook, and the GB10 project for DGX Spark, that we collaborate with NVIDIA, grew more than 80% in 2025 to $1 billion, driven by strong AI adoption and share gains. We have observed very positive feedback for NVIDIA's DGX Spark, and we expect its revenue growth to accelerate into 2026. With AI serving as a catalyst for industry expansion and driving the surge in demand, the global supply chain is facing challenges in fully meeting the increasing needs in 2026, resulting in higher costs across the supply chain. We have secured the capacity required to support MediaTek's growth in data center ASIC and other areas.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe will also adjust our prices to reflect the rising supply chain cost and allocate our supply across products based on the overall profitability. We believe 2026 will continue to be a year where MediaTek's business growth is supported by the AI mega trend. Building on this solid foundation, we will continue to invest in critical technologies, including 5G satellite, 6G advanced process nodes, and advanced packaging for both edge AI and cloud AI solutions to capture growth opportunities ahead. With that, now let me talk about the recent business performance for our three revenue groups. Our fourth quarter Mobile Phone revenue grew 18% quarter-over-quarter and 8% year-over-year in NTD, achieving record high quarterly revenue and accounting for 59% of total revenue.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThis was driven by the successful ramps of our flagship SoC, Dimensity 9500, as well as our premium SoC, Dimensity 8500. For the year 2025, MediaTek's Mobile Phone business grew 8% year-over-year in US dollar, surpassing $10 billion in revenue and achieving a record high. Within this, flagship SoCs exhibited robust growth and contributed $3 million in revenue.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThese results strongly demonstrate the widespread recognition and market position that MediaTek Dimensity platform has successfully established. For 2026, under the pressure of increasing memory and BOM costs, we expect overall smartphone and demand to be negatively impacted. We will work closely with our customers to strategically adjust the product portfolio in order to mitigate the impact. For the first quarter of 2026, we expect Mobile Phone revenue to decline significantly quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to Smart Edge Platforms.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn the fourth quarter, this group declined eight quarter-over-quarter and grew 13% year-over-year in NTD, accounting for 37% of total revenue. The sequential decline was due to consumer electronics seasonality, whereas the year-over-year growth was mainly driven by share gains in high-end tablets, powered by our Dimensity 8000 and 9000 series. In 2025, Smart Edge Platforms grew 21% year-over-year in US dollars, benefiting from market's continuous adoption of AI and faster connectivity, as well as our global share gains. For example, our connectivity revenue grew strongly and exceeded $3 billion in 2025. With Wi-Fi 7 revenue tripling and the 5G modem doubling. We anticipate these positive trends to extend into 2026.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nEven without factoring in the expected data center ASIC revenue, our Smart Edge Platforms revenue is still expected to grow healthily this year, demonstrating the structured strength across our business portfolio. In 2026, in addition to the exciting growth opportunities from data center, auto, and computing that I mentioned earlier, we also expect higher adoption of AI and faster connectivity to continue across applications.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe are once again at the forefront of technology upgrades with our industry-leading Wi-Fi 8 solutions unveiled at CES this year, and we expect early customer adoptions towards the end of the year. For the first quarter of 2026, we expect our smart edge products to grow sequentially and year-over-year, as several products, such as connectivity, TV, and computing devices, recover from the low seasonality.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMoving on to Power IC, this group accounted for 5% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and was down 8% quarter-over-quarter and 11% year-over-year. The sequential decline is due to consumer electronics seasonality, while automotive and industrial grew in the quarter. In the first quarter of 2026, we expect our IC revenue to be flattish. Moving to the guidance. In the first quarter of 2026, we expect the recovery of Smart Edge Platforms will partially offset the sequential decline of Mobile Phones.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe further expect our first quarter revenue to be in the range of TWD 141.2 billion-TWD 150.2 billion, flat to decline 6% sequentially and down 2%-8% year-over-year, at a forecasted exchange rate of TWD 31.2 to $1. Gross margin is forecasted at 46%, ±1.5 percentage points. Quarterly operating expense ratio to be at 31%, ±2 percentage points. In closing, we believe 2026 will be a year where MediaTek's business growth is supported by the AI mega trend. Meanwhile, we aim to protect our profitability through disciplined pricing and strategic capacity allocation. We will also remain fully focused on execution and collaborate closely with our global supply chain partners. With the vast opportunities brought by ubiquitous AI ahead, we firmly believe we are on the right track of our mid to long-term growth journey. This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Rick. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A session. May we please have the first question?\n\n**Operator**\nYes. And ladies and gentlemen, we are now in Q&A session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star key and one on your telephone keypad, and please ask your questions after your name is announced. And please limit your questions to two at a time, to allow more participants to join the discussion. And after two questions, we will move to the next caller.\n\n**Operator**\nShould you have more questions, please press star key and one again to come back to the queue. And to cancel your questions, just simply press star key and two. As a reminder, it is greatly appreciated that you turn off the speakerphone mode of your device to prevent possible echo effect. We thank you for your cooperation. Now, please press star key and one if you would like to ask questions. Thank you.The first one to ask question, Sunny Lin from UBS.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So to kick off, first question on Cloud ASIC. In recent few months, Cloud ASIC demand appeared to continue to strengthen. So with that, should we expect upside for your total addressable market estimate of $50 billion by 2028, and your market share target of 10%-15%?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI believe we shared about $50 billion last time, and 10%-15% market share. We do not have a really formal estimate, re-estimate of this market size, but I certainly believe to it, it's safe to go up by $20 billion, for instance, about $50 billion-$70 billion. I think that's without really a detailed analysis, but that's my estimate. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nRight. Well, so sorry, just to clarify, given people really pay attention to your guidance. And so let's say if addressable market is up to $70 billion in 2028, and you're still in for a 10%-13% type of market share, or you think could be higher given the progress made in recent few months?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think in 2028, to tell the truth, a bit farther. We have ideas, but I think, let me say 10%-15% is rather safe, estimate. We certainly strive to go higher.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nGot it. And then my second question is to follow up on the business model for core ASIC. And so maybe one is, David, if you could help us understand going to 2027, when you scale the ASIC shipment, how should we think about the incremental OpEx increase? And given now we are into the ramp, could you also give us an update on gross margin, also OP margin profile, for the project?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI'll probably start with the OpEx. I think OpEx ratio, in which is scaled into the revenue so far for the full year, also for next year, I think we are looking for the flattish. Okay? The ratio should be similar. Given the fact the revenue will grow, so the OpEx dollar will continue to increase. We will basically invest more, like, I think Rick, our CEO, explained we're gonna invest more for all key technologies. Profitability-wise, I think that's the same approach. I think overall, due to the mix of different, business model and also accounting principle, the better way to think about that, especially for 2027, when we start to ramp, is you're gonna see, operating margin accretive. I think that's probably the best way to think about that. Yeah.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you. Sorry, maybe one last follow-up. Since you mentioned you have already secured the next generation, called ASIC project, how should we think about your value add, your content, and then also competition, evolving, into the next generation? Thank you very much.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWell, the next generation product certainly is quite a bit more complex in just about every aspect. And we have demonstrated our capability to elevate our technology and IP capabilities convincingly to our customer. And also on top of that, our execution capability, which we are already demonstrating right now in our first chip situation. So I really believe, together with our what we've been discussing before, our hybrid model with flexibility, with a tremendous service to our customers, I think all these add up to a tremendous value add to our customers for their build-up of their very massive compute power development. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Investment Banking Analyst)\nThank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Now, next one to ask question, Laura Chen, Citi. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYes. Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. My question is also about ASIC. Thank you, Rick, for the update on the promising outlook. We are already working on the next generation project. Can you share with us, is there any change in terms of business model? Like, we now are mainly doing studies and also the turnkey service for our client. Since, Rick, you just mentioned that the design is getting more complex, will the business model change involve more IPs that MediaTek will be able to provide? And also, as we are targeting like a 10%-15% of the market share. Can we kind of assume that this business will be able to achieve like a 20% or higher of our total revenues in next year?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAll right. The business model, I think we remain, as I said, our hybrid business model. The value add, you know, of course, will vary from generation to generation, but I'd like to also say, given the high degree of complexity which is added to the next generation chip, we are providing, I think, actually more value. If you look at the total, while our customers is also adding more value in their aspect. So that's why we have been always said, this is a win-win model. We get more value, they get more value, and together they will certainly gain more market share in their end of the business. So I'm very pleased with that development. As to the 2027, good year. What was the question?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nQuestion will be for, yeah, 20% of the-\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYeah, I guess 20% or higher revenue contribution.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOf course, I think you're asking for really event or indication, I guess, for 2027 revenue. I think it's possible, certainly. I think 20% is something we believe we have reasonable chance to get to, and we'll do our very best to achieve that.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYeah, sure. Thank you. Maybe just quick follow-up, as I recall, that we are also working with NVIDIA on NVLink Fusion. So, are we also seeing that any, like, a progress on the potential engagement with our ASIC business?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe model, the NVLink Fusion model, is, is being developed. This is. Again, this model by itself is a complex model, from technical point of view and from business, development point of view. I would say, we continue to have a very strong and a close relationship with NVIDIA, and we both are building the model. The build model and the targeted, potential, customers, and I cannot really disclose too much more, but it's ongoing. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nYeah. Okay, sure. No problem. My next question is about the gross margin outlook. I recall last time, David, you mentioned that the gross margin for flagship smartphone SoC seems to be lower than corporate average. So I'm just wondering that, actually we see that the component price hike has more impact on the entry level or low-end segmentation. And the portion of our flagship on the good side is that the, probably the revenue will be able to kind of support it to compensate the weakness in the low-end space. But how would the impact on the gross margin side, and how should we think about the gross margin trends in this year?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for full year 2026, our goal is actually to aim to sustain our growth margin at around 46% level, which was similar to the guidance we gave our, starting from our last quarter. You know, when you look at our, our growth margin fourth quarter last year and also the guidance this year, I think you can consider that will be our goal to maintain at full year. And, how do we achieve that? I think, like what we've explained during the opening remark, given the overall supply chain tightness right now, I think we've been going through a very rigid about the, the capacity allocation among the business growth rate and also the profitability, and that's point number one.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nPoint number two, given the overall, the cost increase in pressure, we are also in discussion with our customer. For certain product, I guess we have to pass on some of the cost increase. So combined of that, I think we'll be reasonable, but the goal will be maintain the growth margin around 46% for the full year.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Research Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you. Very helpful.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First off, on the data center ASIC project, could you talk a little bit about your understanding of what you are facing from a competitive landscape perspective? Because this has been largely the domain of one vendor until very recently for this project. And also, Rick, could you kind of help us understand a little bit on the technology preparation that you've done on high-speed SerDes, including 400G plus, 3.5D and CPO? Can you give us a little bit more details on how we can look at MediaTek's capabilities? Because that seems to be quite critical for the next generation, the follow-on project that you mentioned.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYeah. Goku, I mean, I guess your first part of the question is if you're asking whether how we view other suppliers, our policy is not to comment on competitors' situation. But on the other hand, for our own investment, the multiple technologies and IP areas I mentioned, I discussed during the remarks. And then we have staffed through internal resource consolidation. We have many very capable engineers. While we hire high caliber technologies, including architects, including a power expert, including optics expert. Yeah, those are very difficult technologies. We certainly know that because we're doing them. But we also. Oh, by the way, we're also collaborating with some third party major third party players.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nSo, while they remain challenged, very challenging for us, but if you look at the past two plus years, I think our track record has shown that we have been able to not only catch up, but also to provide level playing field capabilities for our next generation. We will continue to compete for future and a broader range of business opportunities. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nJust to follow up, so this current project that is going into production pretty soon this year, do you think that the deployment model is going to be different compared to previously that you were working on some different workload compared to what your competitor is working on? I'm just asking because so far, if you look at data center AI, most of the demand has been largely at the very high end of the spectrum, whether it is for NVIDIA GPUs or AI ASICs. So just wanted to understand, is there like a very big division of workload that is happening at the customer, which gives you this opportunity to kind of break in and kind of for the customer also to segment the demand more clearly?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWell, basically, Goku, this question of course needs to be answered by our customer. I'm sure you understand the pace of the ASIC chips of such complexity. You know, you have to go back certain amount of years to start when you started the design, and then you look at the progress or the status of the AI or generative AI at that time. Then during through that design process into the production, as you know, again, we're measuring in. I wouldn't say I cannot say exactly how many years, but you know well. Things change, but we believe the design of our customers ASIC chips they have taken into consideration of their own internal workloads needs, plus their external requirement workloads. But I cannot say how they balance those workloads. But we have, as far as I understand, they really are very high on this chip. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Just one last question on flagship smartphone. Given we are expecting a tough market for smartphones, are we still expecting the flagship segment to grow this year, or we think we might have to give up some opportunities in to protect the profitability?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nGoku, I think from the market share perspective, flagship market share perspective, given our new product coming out every year and also all new product are very competitive, I think we still feel comfortable the market share will continue to gain. And likewise, actually, because right now is the more second content in there, we're also seeing generation after generation, the blended ASP, generation after generation, the higher. But the last variable, if you like, really the overall shipment, I have to say, given the overall, the memory situation right now is still evolving or developing. Based on what we see, probably that will become somewhat, year-over-year, having some pressure on the flagship overall, the market shipment, not the market share. At least we can somehow balance that with our continued gain on market share and also continue, you know, aggression on our ASP.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Hao Liu from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nYes. Thanks, Rick, Dave, and David and Jessie, for taking my questions, and congrats on the solid results and guidance. So I want you to follow up on the smartphone business. Would you provide more detail about the smartphone linearity for this year, affecting your guidance for a significant decline in first quarter?\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nAnd from the full year perspective, it is going to see negative impacts from the other component supply shortage. Just wondering if you have any quantitative outlook for the overall market versus your own shipment. And then, your overall situation across the mid, high, low-end smartphones, as you are reallocating or optimizing your product mix. Could you also just share your view on the market share gain or loss, as the previous questions? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. Some of the, some of your questions involve a detailed resolution, probably I won't be able to comment. But let me probably start with our full year view for smartphone. Very straightforward, I think given the overall memory situation and we believe actually the overall smartphone this year, year-over-year, maybe we're seeing a decline. I think that's on the top line. In terms of the detailed resolution for flagship, mainstream, entry-level, even including 4G, we probably won't be able to provide the detail. But the key point is, when you look at our overall business portfolio, our non-smartphone business, like we explained during the opening remark, will offset, you know, big part of that and will grow, you know, nicely.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nPlus, our data center new revenue coming in, which right now we guide is more than TWD 1 billion. I think overall, we're still looking for the top line year-over-year growth. I think that's the, probably that's our feedback. But for the detail segmentation resolution, we'll, in general, we don't comment that.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nOkay. Okay. Yes, that's clear. And then, I think just on ASIC and beyond hyperscaler accelerators, should we expect your ASIC business to grow, beyond this part of the market? For example, like server CPUs and also networking chipsets and beyond cloud AI computing. Could you also discuss more in detail about your potential in automotive ADAS partnership with DENSO? Because that is going to be a huge chunk of opportunity with, higher level, ADAS being adopted across the vehicles. And then, I think, as part of my second question is that you also mentioned about you are going to put more effort in 5G satellite. Could you discuss more in detail on what kind of chipsets you are working on with your customers, or is it going to be part of your effort in low Earth orbit? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. About data center AI, of course, now and, our first priority and focus remain at the, what we're going to ship, this year, next year, and also the next project, following... But in the meantime, we are diligently working on the market. But the AI market is just changing very, very fast, every monthly, every quarter, for sure. So we are rapidly adapting that dynamics. That's why we are investing in technology that is not just for one customer. We are developing technology which are generic, more generic also, for other applications, where, like, inferencing is getting a lot more important, as the GenAI development is has gone. So the answer is, we are, but I do not. You know, I don't think we can share a lot more than that. On the other new business, satellite. You have. You asked automotive and satellite?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAutomotive, certainly, we are very excited to work with Denso. I mean, we all know this is one of the top automotive Tier 1 player. Very deep technology capability and very strong business relations with multiple major car OEMs. So the combination between the two companies is just perfect. They provide the deep vehicle integration, understanding all the safety requirements. We provide the low power, and so we see very high performance, plus a very high AI capability that the ADAS will need for the next, at least four or five years. So we're excited, and I believe our--they are too. We look forward to major revenues from both. Satellite, now we actually, we both work on the NTN.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFrom modem point of view, we also actually have a Wi-Fi solution for some of the base stations on Earth for the satellite business. So this is one area that we feel very good. We cannot say. We believe they're fast growing, but we don't, we cannot say how fast so far. But from whatever we are seeing, our connectivity solutions from both modem and Wi-Fi point of view, we have very strong position already, and we expect to grow on that basis.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nOkay, yeah. Thank you so much. That's very clear. Just one small follow-up, and I will be back in the queue. Is that, for that NTN projects or the satellite chips that you have, is it going to be more on the edge side or more going to be on the infrastructure or base station side? And then, I think a couple of years ago, you provided a few that cater for the next few years on the sales and also margins. I'm not sure if you are able to provide such guidance at this stage for 2026 and also 2027. Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for the NTN is more on the edge side, not on the satellite side, I think just to be clear. In terms of the guidance, we probably won't be able to provide guidance so far because there will still be a few years to come. It's growing, but still be a few years to come.\n\n**Hao Liu** (Assistant VP)\nGot it. Thanks so much. Back to you, David.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my question, and also congratulations for a very strong outlook, especially on the ASIC side. So I do have a two-part questions. One is also about ASIC, and the second question will be on Spark. For the ASIC, I wanted to mention whether you see strengths over the past month, meaning there's an upside to your forecast, especially next year. And if that's the case, you just mentioned you already assured the key components, but are you sure that your TSMC HBM can really support that so-called upside order?\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nAnd lastly, gross margin trend. I'm wondering for those kind of upside revenue, do you think the gross margin, incremental gross margin would decline? And lastly, given the revenue size is so big, do you think the customer want to change to the COT model in the current generation or next generation? So that's my questions about ASIC business.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe are, as we said in our remarks, we are very confident for our fourth quarter revenue of more than $1 billion. We said for 2027, it's multiple billion dollars. That's the range, certainly. I would say we are, we believe if, and whether I believe we will, when we deliver, when we execute, there's we expect to see some upside.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nOkay.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThen the supply, from supply point of view, and I also said earlier that we have secured supplies for data center ASIC needs and some other areas. We have a good scale to work with the major suppliers, and we also have certain flexibility among our own different product portfolio. So we also have high confidence that we can manage, we can provide the supplies for the demand coming next year. We have been preparing for that for some time.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nLastly, again, that question is not really up to us, but again, as I said earlier, I really believe, I think all depends on overall objectives. The overall objectives, I believe our customers, or actually for that matter, all the CSPs, is really to provide timely and high quality, low power computing capability at a very good TCO to grow their business. And, as the market is changing so fast, the technology pace is so fast, if you look at the history of our industry, usually it would take partners to work together to achieve that required growth target for everyone. But unless you are in a very mature industry, you probably can go just by yourself, but we are not in that phase at all. There is a huge amount of growth ahead of us.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI fully believe that the value add we provide, and we are also, as I said earlier, working hard with our customers to enhance their value add. It's not a zero-sum game, period. We believe this will continue. Thank you.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nYep. Yep, that makes a lot of sense, Rick. So just a small follow-up on ASIC side before I move to smartphone. So you mentioned about your you feel like your 10%-15% market share is pretty safe to achieve, right? And my understanding is that your customers ASICs probably account for half or even more of the kind of a total ASIC TAM, right? So is that right way to think about your allocation from these key customers would be like 20%-30% or even higher? Yeah, based on those data points that I just described.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nCharlie, I think, again, so the earlier question talked about sort of target market shares or the market share goal is 2028. You know, this is still a few years away, so there are so many moving targets. I think our folks right now, if we ask them well about the two projects on hand, and market share will become, hopefully a happy consequence. Okay? So that's why actually we don't want to give out the detail. Actually, we will not be able to give out the detailed guidance for the market share for 2028.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nGot you. Thanks, David. So my second question on smartphone will be relatively brief. I wanted to get management's thought about the agentic AI in China smartphone markets. What do you think about this Doubao such kind of feedback and our media and customers want to do similar kind of application. When do you think that they will become a killer app? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think we've been dealing with this question, so for at least two years, if not longer.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYeah.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI will not give you a kind of a boilerplate answer. It's not obvious, this “killer app,” but I don't think—I'm not sure that's the right thinking. I think the agentic AI will just blend into your life with the smartphone, and that smartphone can be a very smart smartphone, or it can... And it may be just a mid-end, because you can, depending on what you need, you can access very sophisticated GenAI models on your phone, but for even more bigger applications, you need to go to the cloud. So it's we provide solution that will have more than sufficient compute power, but that compute power will be limited by the form factor of the phone itself. That's physics.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nSo the phone will provide ample AI or GenAI or agentic AI capability by itself, but and I believe the demand of the application will increase so much, and that phone certainly will play the other role of being just connecting to the cloud very effectively, efficiently, and that will fill both ends. I think it's a part of life. And there may be other form of devices that will provide, that will enhance people's life using agentic AI. And we certainly, if there is opportunity or outlook, we are pursuing them also. Thank you.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Managing Director)\nThank you. Thanks. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, David.\n\n**Operator**\nLadies and gentlemen, with the interest of time, we are going to take the last one to ask question. Arthur Lai from Macquarie. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Division Director)\nHi. Hi. Thanks, Rick and David and Jessie, for taking my question. So my first question, still on the cloud AI. Just want to follow up on Charlie's question. When you comment the scale and also flexibility, can you help investors understand, are you trying to allocate the, the skill city resources to incubate your new cloud business? And what's the, the resources you refer to? Is it the wafer location, or is it subtrade or your experienced engineer? Thank you. That's my first question.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nArthur, David here. I think, long story short, we will allocate amount or what you say, internal R&D resource, like during the opening remark. I think Rick's talking about we've been investing sizable R&D and plus we've been hiring aggressively external resource. So internal resource, I think we will definitely allocate to this, you know, fast-growing area, especially with the huge addressable market. For the overall manufacturing capacity, I mean, we will put a priority on that as well. So all of that, yeah.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Division Director)\nOh, thank you. The second question is more on the cycle and also history. This is actually not the first time we envisioned the subtleties of the smartphone. Compared to the last two cycles, can management or Rick comment on what the MediaTek's strategy right now, compared to the previous second down cycle? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. Certainly 2026 is a tough year for smartphone. I'm sure you, you guys have read about that. No need to further elaborate. But I also believe this is a cyclical year. The demand will remain solid next year or maybe 1.5 years. I cannot say for sure, but I am quite sure the demand will come back. And when it come back, when it comes back, it will come back in force, and we need to be prepared for that, and we will be. MediaTek during the past few years we have I think developed, equipped ourselves to...\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think, well, to live through the cycle is too weak actually, or to actually, I believe we will be stronger after the cycle. The capability we're building, the market position, I feel very confident. The mobile business, well, at the, well, it's now in the sixth year of the 5G generation, where certainly the growth, overall growth is saturating. We all know that. But the MediaTek's position, the capability, is much, much stronger compared to our last generation of modem technology. I don't like this down cycle, but that's life, and we will be better after that. Thank you.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Division Director)\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOkay, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for all your questions. I'll hand it over now to Ms. Jessie Wang for closing comments. Ms. Wang, please go ahead.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes MediaTek 2025 fourth quarter conference call, and an audio replay will be available in one hour after the call at the Investor section of MediaTek's website. We would like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\n**Operator**\nYes. Once again, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect now. Goodbye.",

Good afternoon, everyone. Now, let's start with the 2025 third quarter financial results. The currency used here is NTD. The foreign exchange rate applied to the quarter was 30 NTD to 1 USD, representing a 2.8% NTD appreciation compared with the foreign exchange rate of 30.8 in the second quarter. Every $1 of NTD appreciation against USD will reduce our NTD revenue by 1%. With that, revenue for the third quarter was $142.1 billion, down 5.5% sequentially and up 7.8% year-over-year. If we exclude the FX factor in USD, third quarter revenue was down 2.6% sequentially and up 16.2% year-over-year. Gross margin for the quarter was 46.5%, down 2.6 percentage points from the previous quarter and down 2.3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nPlease be reminded that gross margin in the second quarter benefits from a one-time item, which increased second quarter gross margin by roughly 1.9 percentage points. Operating expense for the quarter was $43.9 billion, compared with $44.5 billion in the previous quarter and $40.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $22.2 billion, down 24.5% sequentially and down 7% year-over-year. Non-TFRS operating income for the quarter was $22.8 billion. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.6%, down 3.9 percentage points from the previous quarter and down 2.5 percentage points year-over-year. Non-TFRS operating margin for the quarter was 16.1%. Net income for the quarter was $25.5 billion, down 9.3% sequentially and down 0.5% year-over-year. Non-TFRS net income for the quarter was $26 billion.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nNet profit margin for the quarter was 17.9%, down 0.8 percentage points from the previous quarter and down 1.5 percentage points year-over-year. Non-TFRS net profit margin for the quarter was 18.3%. EPS for the quarter was $15.84, down from $17.5 in the previous quarter and down from $15.94 in the year-ago quarter. Non-TFRS EPS for the quarter was $16.18. A reconciliation table for our TFRS and non-TFRS financial measurement is attached in our press release for your information, and that concludes my comments. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, David. I would like to turn the call to CEO, Dr. Rick Tsai, for prepared remarks.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThank you, Jessie. Good afternoon, everyone. MediaTek's third quarter revenue in USD came in at the high end of our guidance range, thanks to better-than-expected Dimensity 9500 demand. Quarterly revenue in NTD exceeded our guidance range, mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate of $1 to $30 NTD, compared to our assumption of $1 to $29 NTD. During the quarter, we observed exciting developments in ubiquitous AI. Ongoing innovations in agentic AI and AI applications across industries are fueling demand for AI computation. As a result, several hyperscale companies have announced plans to significantly increase capital expenditure to build substantial AI computing power, which will be deployed through multiple years. We believe this drives a virtuous cycle for long-term AI growth, and we are still at the very early stage of the AI megatrend.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nUnderpinned by our leading key technologies and strong execution capabilities, MediaTek stands firmly to capture growing opportunities brought by ubiquitous AI. Here are some recent progresses. In the cloud, improving data center total cost of ownership, TCO, has been crucial for hyperscale companies. Customized solutions that are optimized for CSP-specific workloads are well-suited to add value to data centers. Our first AI accelerator ASIC project is well-executed. We are on track for our $1 billion cloud ASIC revenue in 2026 and expect multiple billions of revenue in 2027. The achievement reflects our ability in integrating our world-class interconnect IP to custom DLNAs and managing the advanced nodes and advanced packaging supply chain. Our solid execution, optimizing technology, and scale have gained increasing recognition in the market. Follow-on project that is more complex than previous DLNAs is already underway, with revenue expected in 2028 and beyond.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMeanwhile, we continue to aggressively engage with the second hyperscale company for new data center ASIC projects. With high confidence, we believe in our value propositions for cloud AI customers and expect rapid growth in the future. At the edge, we build powerful edge AI chips to enable more on-device AI innovations across smartphones, tablets, PCs, automotive, and more. In the third quarter, we launched our latest flagship mobile SoC, Dimensity 9500. It features the industry-leading dual-core NPU architecture, with one performance NPU to handle more complicated AI instructions and one efficient NPU to run light AI models for always-on AI experiences. Customers have utilized this powerful architecture to enhance user experience in applications such as photo shooting and AI assistant. On the other hand, GB10, the edge AI chip that we co-designed with NVIDIA, has recently begun mass production.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nGB10 powers the world's smallest AI supercomputer, DGX Spark AI supercomputer, which can run inference on AI models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models with up to 70 billion parameters locally. Looking ahead, we believe that advanced process technologies and packaging solutions will unleash more AI innovations and usage cases across multiple industries. MediaTek is one of few companies capable of making continuous investments. We completed our first 2-nanometer tape-out at TSMC in the third quarter and will be a front-runner in launching 2-nanometer chips starting in 2026 for customers across industries. With that, now let me talk about the recent business performance for our three revenue groups. Mobile phones accounted for 53% of total revenue in the third quarter and grew 4% year-over-year and declined 4% quarter over quarter. In USD, this revenue group grew 13% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nDemand for our Dimensity 9500 has been stronger than expected. The first wave of customers has launched flagship smartphones such as the Vivo X300 and Oppo X9 series in China and plans to expand into more regions such as India, Southeast Asia, and Europe by the end of the year. For the fourth quarter, thanks to the strong ramp of Dimensity 9500, we expect mobile revenue to grow strongly quarter over quarter. The flagship smartphone revenue for the year has been tracking above our expectations. We are confident of exceeding $3 billion of flagship smartphone revenue in 2025, representing more than 40% of year-over-year growth. Now, let me move on to smart edge platforms. In the third quarter of 2025, this group grew 14% year-over-year and declined 6% sequentially, accounting for 42% of revenue.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn USD, smart edge platforms grew 23% year-over-year and declined 4% quarter over quarter. The year-over-year growth was mainly driven by a better mix in tablets with strong AI adoptions and global share gains across connectivity products. The sequential decline was mainly due to certain demand being pulled forward to the first half of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect smart edge platforms' revenue to decline seasonally. However, we expect automotive to grow strongly in the quarter. Several of our e-cockpit customers in China will launch new car models across high-end and mid-range segments, driving our auto revenue to more than double year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect the trends to extend into 2026. In addition, our premium cockpit solution, CX-1, is also expected to begin volume production in late 2026, adding momentum for future growth.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nNow, moving on to Power IC, which accounted for 5% of total revenue in the third quarter, declined 4% year-over-year and declined 10% quarter over quarter. In USD, Power IC grew 3% year-over-year and declined 7% quarter over quarter. For the fourth quarter, Power IC revenue is expected to decline seasonally quarter over quarter. Moving to the guidance in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from our flagship smartphone, GB10 project, and automotive business to grow sequentially. These revenue strengths are expected to more than offset the seasonally weaker consumer electronics demand. With that, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of NT$142.1 billion to NT$150.1 billion, flat to up 6% sequentially, and up 3% to 9% year-over-year at a forecasted exchange rate of $30.6 NTD to $1.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nGross margin is forecasted at 46%, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, quarterly. Operating expense ratio to be at 31%, plus or minus 2 percentage points. With the midpoint of our fourth quarter revenue guidance, 2025 is expected to be a record year of more than $19 billion of revenue. For 2026, we continue to see great growth opportunities. Amid a tight capacity environment, we will strategically adjust our pricing and allocate our capacity among different product lines to reflect the increasing manufacturing costs. For the mid to long term, we are firmly on our growth journey. We're well-positioned with our leading key technologies and strong execution capabilities to capitalize on business opportunities brought by the ubiquitous AI. We believe our major growth drivers, including flagship SoCs, automotive, computing, and data centers, will continue to bear fruit in the future. This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Rick. Operator, we are now ready for a Q&A session. May we please have the first question?\n\n**Operator**\nYes.

Now, please press star key and 1 if you would like to ask questions. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThe first one to ask questions, Sunny Lin from UBS. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nHi, Rick, David, Jessie, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on cloud ASIC. Obviously, last few months, stronger industry developments across the board. What's your current expectations on the addressable market compared with your prior $40 billion expectations for accelerators by 2028? How's your progress on expanding your client and project base? I know you mentioned you are engaging with the second project. How's the overall implication to your market share in the space?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes, we did talk about about $40 billion TAM for the data center ASIC revenue. I think about two years ago, with the current, or actually starting from last year, the CapEx increase from the CSP companies, we now are looking at, I believe, at least $50 billion TAM for the data center ASIC revenue. We certainly strive to gain a lot of new businesses, and I would say at least right now, we strive for 10%-15%+ market share going forward in the next two years plus. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nThank you very much. Two years meaning by 2028. If we use $50 billion total addressable market value, that would imply over $5 billion type of opportunities. Does that imply that you are on good track to expand your project base to more than one by 2028?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes, we have projects at hand. We feel quite confident that we certainly need to execute, and we will execute to get those products to our customers and to their data center. In addition, we believe we will be able to gain some other projects from different CSP companies. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nThank you very much. Sorry, maybe just a follow-up. Given what you just shared, Rick, seemed pretty encouraging. For the new projects, because you talked about the first project going to mass production in 2026, and that's on track to $1 billion sales, how should we think about the other projects? What's the timing for revenue contribution? Will that be in 2027 or mostly from 2028?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAs I said in the remarks, we believe the first project will generate multiple billions in 2027. Another project will start delivering revenue starting 2028 and beyond. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nThank you. Sorry, my second question, if I may, would be on gross margin. Maybe for David. How should you think about the gross margin from here, based on the guidance for Q4? It seems like the midpoint is down a bit versus the prior 47%-48% type of range. What's the decline, and for 2026, how should we think about the puts and takes?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for the fourth quarter, gross margin movement is mainly driven or impacted by the product mix or revenue mix in the fourth quarter. For next year, I think we are still strategizing about our overall capacity allocation and pricing strategy. I think given the overall semiconductors industry background, which I think everybody knows, for the leading edge node, which is A, it's actually somewhat limited capacity, and because the demand is very strong, and also B, the cost of those leading nodes are increasing. With that industry background, we need to allocate our capacity strategically to those higher value-added segments. In the meantime, we're actually working in the direction to basically pass on that increase of cost to our customers as well. For the gross margin next year, please give us some more time. We'll update later.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nFor fourth quarter, again, that's actually mainly due to the product mix and industry mix in the second quarter.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Laura Chen from Citi.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nHello. Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is also on the ASIC business. I'm just wondering how would MediaTek manage your R&D resource to work on the scalar AI growth? In particular, we have a great potential for the second customers. Will MediaTek consider any potential joint venture or investment? Also, I'm just wondering, we see that scale-up and scale-out are very important for AI data center buildup. What MediaTek can provide to gain more market share going forward? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFrom an R&D point of view, we are definitely not only, we have been moving our R&D budget, which certainly includes the people and the financial means, into data center technologies, IPs, and execution capabilities. This has been going on for a while, but we continue to increase the investment. We have strengthened significantly our talents in the U.S. so that we can have also not only technical capability, but also the efficiency of the communication directly in the U.S. We are embarking on numerous IPs, certainly in the high-speed interconnect area, either across the chip or from chip to the rack. We're including the silicon photonics. We also certainly are working on the 2-nanometer process technologies, the 3.5D, very large reticle size chips for the packaging.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe company is fully committed to building the technology and the IP capability so that we can not only build the chips for our customers next year and 2027, 2028, but also the capabilities that we can provide for 2028 and beyond timeframe. And that's.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nThank you, Rick. Yeah, because it sounds quite encouraging for the next few years' growth. Just wondering, will those new technologies be developed by MediaTek internally, or are you also seeking other partnerships outside the company?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe do both ways. Many of the IPs we develop internally. In the photonics, for instance, area, we have strong partnerships with other major IP suppliers, not to mention TSMC on the packaging plus the technology, process technology. We are also certainly looking at opportunity acquiring talents outside of the company. If we do something, we'll let you know later. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nThank you. My second question is about the smartphone demand into next year. As we see that the resource in the tech supply chain has been moved to the AI data center, including foundry, memory, substrate, etc., do you see any impact on your customers' order pooling momentum into next year or product portfolio planning? Would that also impact MediaTek indirectly, given that inflationary environment? How should we look at the smartphone shipments outlook, and how would MediaTek help your customers mitigate the risk at the same time to maintain your gross margin and also shipment outlook?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe've been maintaining our position about the smartphone shipment, unit shipment. Overall, about low single-digit growth, and we have not changed that view. The changes, of course, happen mostly in the distribution of those shipments among, from the very high, from the flagship premium to the mainstream entry. As we have said before, there is no question about a bit of the moving toward both ends of the spectrum. We have been very successful in building our position in the flagship and the premium, like I said. We will continue doing that. What we have seen so far is our OEM customers, they have been able to also still moving very good quantity in their sale out using our latest SoC, flagship SoC 9500. They are also, I think, making adjustments in their pricing, and by that, I mean moving up in their pricing.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe recognize also some of the challenges in the DRAM supplies and the other pricing environment. What we believe is with our value brought by the 9500 chips and our overall system advantages, we will get our value for our chips, as David just kind of outlined in his answers a few minutes ago. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nYeah. Hi. Good afternoon, Rick, David, and Jessie. My first question is on the data center ASIC as well. Recently, there have been so many announcements coming through on data center ASIC project win. So far, it seems like it's very much a winner-take-all kind of market, given one vendor seems to be getting pretty much all the newly announced projects so far. What are you observing here talking to some of these? I think you're already talking to a couple of TSPs, if not more. What is the feedback you were getting from these companies that gives you the confidence to kind of have a more balanced kind of market share profile in this market? Secondly, also for this first project, could you update a little bit on what is the exact status? Given we've had a bit of kind of delay, it looks like.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nWhat is the exact status right now? Has the chip already been kind of taped out? When we talk about a billion-dollar revenue next year, is that all turnkey-related revenue, or does it also include some of the NRE revenues that you would be looking? That's my first question. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI'm going to try to answer your first question. I think there is, I mean, we all have seen the announcement, either from multiple TSP companies, plus OpenAI, etc., etc. I certainly don't need to repeat, simply because that scale of the CapEx. I think it is pretty, I think, natural for the TSP companies to look at their risk exposure, plus the TCO requirements for their investment. The ASIC design, which can optimize their own workload, plus the flexibility of the business model that we provide to enable, to gain our business and also enable their capabilities, I think it's also a very good business model and a business decision for them. We feel comfortable. We understand this is a very difficult and challenging task, but we are confident that we can execute well. For the second question, we're talking about?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for the second question, like our CEO said, we feel fairly comfortable. We're passing a certain key milestone. Basically, we've been taking our test photo already. The revenue we're talking about next year is not including NRE. It's purely the revenue for the shipment.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nUnderstood. That is very clear. Thank you very much. Second question is, in terms of the business model, I think previously for data center ASIC, you had outlined you want to do. Second as well as previous two-in kind of projects. Is there any thinking about potentially trying to move down the curve and also start thinking about taking some role in some purer backend design projects to build up scale? Given the number of projects available are probably still quite few in number, is there any thinking strategically to kind of go down to those kind of projects as well, even if margin threshold might be a little bit lower, but still gives you a lot of dollar profit from those kind of engagements?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe understand the different business models. I must say, in our foreseeable future, we will focus on our current business model, which we believe provides a really good balance between a very, sometimes very high-cost or technology-provided or design-provided business model and a very kind of a much lower value-added backend turnkey service. I think we have the right balance that will benefit our customers and ourselves, MediaTek, for quite a while. Of course, there's some really special situation we can consider. Right now, I must say we are pretty fully occupied to deliver what we are already awarded. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nJust on a follow-up on that, do you think, let's say, a customer goes to GDS2 in kind of projects from currently they are basically full spec in to the largest ASIC vendor out there? Do you think the customer stops there, or do they continue to insource more and more of the IP and basically convert that into a purely backend service kind of model like one of the TSPs already doing?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAgain, this is a strong function of different companies and different companies' philosophy. They're denying complexity. I cannot give you a definitive answer as to which models each customer would like. I'm sure the customer would like to be able to contribute more values through their own means. Overall, at the end of the day, we understand that. We also understand from a customer point of view, there are certainly some pretty high, still strong value-added areas that they are. They probably decide not to do it themselves because, again, you have to weigh the investment and the timing. The schedule at the end of the day also is not only critical, but it's probably the most important factor. I think, again, our model provides the balance of the capability, TCO, and the schedule. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nNow, asking question is Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Executive Director and Technology Research Analyst)\nHi. Good afternoon, Rick, David, and Jessie. My first question is about your AI smartphone. It was great to hear that the selling was very strong. Actually, I attended your product launch events in Shenzhen, and your presentation and marketing was great. I'm wondering what is the so-called sale through so far? You mentioned that you hope to gain some value from your customers, right? We're also hearing some price competition from your U.S. competitor into next year in high-end segments. Can you help us to understand, one, you said whether AI smartphone really has that demand? Two, you said whether they can really offset some so-called pricing pressure from your U.S. competitor in high-end? Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYeah. Charlie, I think what we see, the AI smartphone, especially for the flagship smartphone demand, is very solid. I would say it's good, especially with our new product launch. I think we are still seeing we continue to gain market share. Taking fourth quarter, for example, right now, the fourth quarter guidance we give out is actually 0% to 6% growth. I think this anti-seasonal growth, a big part of the reason is actually we see a fairly strong smartphone shipment starting in fourth quarter this year. Of course, that actually leads to some of the gross margin movement due to the product mix. As far as for the competition you talk about, the competition has been there for actually forever. We've been dealing with that kind of competition for a long time.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nEspecially given the overall supply situation, we actually think there's an opportunity for us to manage the overall capacity allocation and also balancing the pricing going forward. It's challenging. It's not easy, but I think that's the direction we are driving so far.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Executive Director and Technology Research Analyst)\nAll right. Thanks, David. Just a very quick follow-up on your first question's answer. I do have a second question. You mentioned that the flagship kind of shipment is going well. Is that kind of dilutive to your corporate margin? Because your corporate margin is slightly down to 46%. You mentioned about a product mix. The question number one is a follow-up. My second question, maybe to Rick, is that you mentioned about the second big customers in ASIC. Is this project win confirmed, or there's still some uncertainty? The second project is more like your kind of hope or plan, but it is not like a done deal yet. Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nMaybe answer the first question first. Yes, actually, Charlie, I think like we explained, the gross margin movement in the fourth quarter is partially due to the product mix, i.e., the smartphone. Yes.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Executive Director and Technology Research Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nSecond question. I really cannot elaborate too much, but as I said in my opening remarks, you are engaging with high confidence. Thank you.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Executive Director and Technology Research Analyst)\nYeah. Rick, what would MediaTek's key differentiation be besides the TCO? Following Gokul's kind of question, it seems like there's a dominant player kind of winning essentially almost all the high-end projects. Can you elaborate a bit recently? What gives you confidence, and what is MediaTek's key differentiation? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think I kind of articulate our business model and our capabilities. I probably don't want to spend too much time again, but I really think the best evidence is what we're doing now, what we're executing. We are getting good projects and with really strong revenues to come. We have done that in, I would say, a fairly short two years' time. I believe from that point of view, we have gained a lot of credibility in the market among different customers. Thank you.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Executive Director and Technology Research Analyst)\nSure. Thank you. Thanks, Rick.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nNext one to ask question, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (VP and Equity Analyst)\nHello. Thank you for taking my question. I'm happy to hear that you guys have pretty good progress on the GB10 projects. Can you tell us a bit more about the business model you have with NVIDIA, the user case for GB10, and what kind of impact it's going to be when NVIDIA invested in Intel, which theoretically they can do more in x86 architectures in this specific domain?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYeah. Bruce, I think GB10, basically in the business model, we provide the CPU and also the overall system integration and getting a GPU chiplet. The final product go to market will be managed by NVIDIA. There's a long way to explain. This is actually the NVIDIA product. We are their design service and ASIC partner. In terms of segmentation, I believe GB10 right now is being considered about the supercomputers. You can run it on a single GB10. You can run more than 200 billion parameters. You can even stack it together to run a 400 billion parameter. Probably that's the best workstation-like personal computer, personal supercomputer you can get. The product is actually in the market, up and running already. I think both from the product segmentation perspective and also from time to market perspective, we actually have the advantage.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think the second-generation product right now, the partnership is also ongoing. We do believe both from the technology perspective and also the speed, i.e., the time to market perspective, we are actually very competitive as a partnership with NVIDIA. I hope we did also. Ask about the NVIDIA Intel announcement. Number one, of course, we cannot really answer such questions. We're not the party. On the other hand, we read, and from what we understand, you just heard from David, the chip that we collaborate with NVIDIA, the GB10, or there may be a different name for other different applications such as in the PC field. The segment is quite high. This is a really powerful chip. We don't really believe the chips that we build together, the segment of which that we can pursue, will be impacted by the other announcement. Thank you.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (VP and Equity Analyst)\nA quick follow-up. What is the addressable market for this product in 2026 and 2027?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIt's really, what do they call that, professional.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nProfessional user.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYeah. Professional to high-end, very, very high-end. Yes.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (VP and Equity Analyst)\nI see. Okay. My second question is going back to the profitability, right? If you exclude the one-off impact from third quarter, the company's gross margin has sequential decline for like five quarters already. We understand all the pros and cons for the product. If you look at your gross driver, which is flagship models, autos, even for the ASIC, which might have a billion or multibillion dollar revenue in 2027, which are non-margin accretative, when can we see the stabilization of gross margin? Given that the gross driver are all margin dilutive, or we need to shift focus to focus on operating margin in the future?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nBruce, I think we kind of explained that before, especially for the ASIC business model. The key for the ASIC business model, which is very operating margin accretative starting from day one, because the business model is natural and also sometimes actually it's a different arrangement. Judging from the gross margin ratio, probably that's not the best way. It's really just the operating margin ratio, or in another way, which is ROI, is actually the enhancement. Once we start to revenue, especially with the meaningful revenue. On the other product line, on the other hand, we're just dealing with about the increasing cost for the supply chain and also the limited capacity. We just need to strategically allocate our capacity and also try and do our best to pass on that increased cost to our customer. We are working on this direction.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (VP and Equity Analyst)\nFor the modeling purpose, given that you have multiple billion revenue coming from ASIC in 2027, we should model sequential margin decline for the gross margin, but it should be accredited for the operating margin. Is that a right understanding?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYes. I think the big revenue for 2026, we're talking about $1 billion from the ASIC. For 2027, we just give out the guidance, it's going to be multibillion dollars. For 2027, because we still have some time, we will provide some guidance or heads-up probably sometime in 2026. In general, that's the right direction.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (VP and Equity Analyst)\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nNext one to ask question Hess Liu from Bank of America. Go ahead, please.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYes. Hi. Good afternoon, Rick, David, and Jessie. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is regarding your profitability for next year. With growing competition pressure in the mid to low-end smartphones, I'm just wondering if you are able to fully pass on higher manufacturing costs to your customers, or if you could just share your smartphone strategy. Would you prioritize sales growth or margin stability when you face more pressure from both your suppliers and competitors? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think our overall strategy is actually trying to find the best value for our limited capacity. With your question, basically, we're trying to prioritize the profitability over the market share. I think that's our goal.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. We could actually assume that your smartphone business on the profitability, on the margins next year would actually be more stabilized into 2026 versus what we have been seeing in the past few quarters for 2025, right?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for next year's gross margin and also the pricing, right now we are still in a stage working with the market and the customer directly. We will provide the guidance next quarter.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nOkay. Just a quick follow-up on the margins questions. With much higher design and also manufacturing costs on the advanced nodes, so beyond 2-nanometer, will you still consider to migrate as aggressively as before? If you could share your known migration strategy going forward. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThat's being looked at very, very closely and carefully. I mean, it is no secret that the more slow, at least from a two-dimensional point of view, is slowing down. Each generation still provides values, but it's not as strong as before. As in 2-nanometer, certainly we believe the right thing to do. The next node, we're working closely with also our foundry partner to see what is the best way for both parties. It's not fully decided yet. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nShould we consider if your design service products or your own products will be the one migrating the earliest to the most advanced nodes? Would you give some indicator on that?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nUp to 2-nanometer, yes. After 2-nanometer, as I said, it's being looked at very closely and carefully. We cannot comment definitively yet.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. My second question is just regarding your long-term strategy. The traditional market demand growth could still be pretty mild in 2026, and ASIC would be the next key growth driver for the company. I was just wondering if you could share your target for the next two to three years. How much of your revenue is going to come from the edge applications versus the cloud business?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYeah. I think for next year, 2026, I think we already gave our guidance for the new revenue. I should say for the data center revenue, because next year will be the first year we start to run. It will be $1 billion, which means next year, a big part of the revenue on the growth side still will be on other revenue as well. Overall, if you only see about the gross incremental revenue, if I use this term, a big part of that will be data center, and also the rest of that will be the traditional or the existing business. I think that's the guidance. Once we get into 2027, most likely, I think the data center will start to pick up. It will become one of the major incremental revenue contributors.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYeah. Just a quick follow-up to my second question is that if you could share your R&D intensity, which means your R&D expense as % of your sales to each of the business. For cloud versus edge, I would assume probably in your cloud business, the R&D intensity will be higher, right? In the mid to longer term, two to three years view, do you think your R&D expense as % of your sales will actually be higher than what we are seeing now?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nNo, actually. I think the R&D spending in terms of the revenue ratio, I think, will stay, probably even will come down a little bit, mainly due to the revenue growth, yeah, sales growth.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Hess. Our next one to ask question, Brett Simpson from Arete.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nYeah. Thanks very much. I have a two-part question on MediaTek's kind of structural profitability. First of all, in the near term, if I just look at the guidance for Q4, you have flagship smartphones rising in the mix. You have a solid premium automotive ramp-up. I mean, it feels like the mix within the business is getting richer in Q4. You have an FX tailwind sequentially, yet you're guiding down gross margins. I just want to understand the dynamics as to why this is happening. Are you driving pricing aggressively in flagship? Is that why we're seeing profitability sort of decline sequentially? Any help there would be useful. The second part, kind of looking more longer term at MediaTek's structural profitability. If I just sort of step back, you have a relatively low gross margin and a high OpEx to sales versus your large fabless peers.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nIf I look ahead, we have a structural wafer price hike coming from TSMC. You're moving flagship smartphones to 2-nanometer. You have rising ARM royalty rates. It feels like we're heading into a period of high inflation in a price-sensitive smartphone market. Are you able to pass on these cost hikes? How should we think about structural profitability given all these dynamics that we see long-term? Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYeah. I think for fourth quarter, like you say, both for smartphone and automotive, we see a pretty strong growth. Just in terms of the magnitude or contribution, the big part of that still belongs to the smartphone. The gross margin movement is, like I explained earlier, for fourth quarter specifically, mainly due to the mix, i.e., actually the smartphones bring down the gross margin a little bit. I think that's actually for the fourth quarter. For next year and ongoing, like you say, we see the inflation on the semiconductor supply chain. On the side of the inflation, we also see some supply constraint, actually very tight supply along the whole supply chain. We are in the process to decide about the capacity location and also passing on the inflation to our customer. We're in the process of doing this right now.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nSorry, David, just to clarify, when you say smartphones is lower gross margin than corporate average, is flagship lower than corporate average gross margins? Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYes, for the fourth quarter, yes.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nOkay. I had a second question for Rick. I think there's some confusion in the market about MediaTek with the Dimensity 9500 SoC specifically, whether or not MediaTek is a CSS licensee with ARM. I ask because ARM is certainly signaling that you are a CSS licensee, and that would imply a 10% royalty rate is being paid or something in that general vicinity, which is structured a lot higher than we've seen historically. I'm just wondering if you can clarify this position because we're a little bit confused here. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe confusion is not from us, Brad. It's from our supplier. As far as we understand, we are not a CSS licensee. We are not. I just want to be very clear. Thank you.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nOkay, thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. In the interest of time, we are going to take the last one to ask questions. The last one will be Arthur Lai, Macquarie. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Technology Analyst)\nCan you hear me?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Technology Analyst)\nThank you, Rick and David and Jessie. First, congrats on the big win in the ASIC tape-out. I sense that the investor actually underappreciates your company has a very unique position. Number one, the strong partnership with NVIDIA, and also, second is ASIC XPU and scalability. This question is to Rick. Can you share with us how you get the leverage between these two camps, among NVIDIA and also the TPU? I hope you can give us some viewer strategic thinking in the next two to three-year time horizon. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOf course, I'm sure you understand. The nature of the relationship MediaTek has with NVIDIA, which focuses on actually both on the edge side. For one, it's the high-performance CPU, GPU, chiplet design, and application in the computing and automotive side. They are most, they are in the edge side. There is certainly now effort between the two companies to see whether NVIDIA's very strong networking IPs can be utilized in the ASIC business model. That work is ongoing. We certainly cannot comment further. Again, from MediaTek's point of view, the ASIC data center, ASIC business, and the business model are ongoing, and we are reaping fruits in the near future, as you said in your question. That strategy was formulated in the last two, three years, Andy, and that strategy continued to progress. We feel actually really much more confident now compared to before. Thank you.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Technology Analyst)\nThank you. No more questions.\n\n**Operator**\nYes, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for all your questions. I will hand it over to Ms. Jessie Wang for closing comments. Ms. Wang, please go ahead.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes MediaTek 2025 fourth quarter conference call. An audio replay will be available in one hour after the call at the investor section of MediaTek's website. We would like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\n**Operator**\nYes. Thanks again for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Thank you again, and goodbye.",

Financial results and presentations for today's call are available on the Investors section of the company website at www.mediatek.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Jessie Wang, Deputy Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wang, please go ahead.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nGood afternoon, everyone. Joining us today are Dr. Rick Tsai, MediaTek CEO, and Mr. David Ku, MediaTek CFO. Mr. Ku will report our second quarter results, and then Dr. Tsai will provide our prepared remarks. After that, we will open for Q&A. As a reminder, today's presentation will provide forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. The statements are subject to various risks and factors, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements. The presentation materials supplement non-TFRS financial measures. Earnings distribution will be made in accordance with financial statements based on TFRS. For details, please refer to the Safe Harbor statement in our presentation slides. In addition, all contents provided in this teleconference are for your reference only, not intended for investment advice. Neither MediaTek nor any of the independent providers is responsible for any actions taken in reliance on contents provided in today's call.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nNow, I would like to turn the call to our CFO, Mr. David Ku, for the second quarter financial results.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nThank you. Good afternoon. Now, let's start with the 2025 second quarter financial results. Please note that the currency used here is NT dollars. The foreign exchange rate applied to the second quarter result was NT$ 30.9 to $1, which implies around 6.1% appreciation of NT dollar compared to the foreign exchange rate of NT$ 32.9 in the first quarter. Due to the rather sizable FX movement, here we provide some more information. Basically, for every 1% appreciation for NT dollars, we will have a negative impact for gross margin by around 0.2 percentage points and also around 0.25 percentage points to the operating margin. With that, revenue for the second quarter was NT$ 150.4 billion, down 1.9% sequentially and up 18.1% year over year. If we exclude the FX factor, in US dollar terms, second quarter revenue was up 4.4% sequentially and up 23.8% year over year.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nGross margin for the quarter was 49.1%, up 1 percentage point from the previous quarter and up 0.3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's gross margin includes a one-time related to a previous LTA, which contributed around 1.9 percentage points to the gross margin. Excluding this one-time item and assuming the FX rate back to our earlier guidance level of NT$ 32.5, our second quarter gross margin would have been 48.4% at the high end of our earlier guidance range. Operating expense for the quarter was NT$ 44.5 billion, compared with NT$ 43.8 billion in the previous quarter and NT$ 37.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Operating income for the quarter was NT$ 29.4 billion, down 2.2% sequentially and up 17.7% year over year. Non-TFRS operating income for the quarter was NT$ 30 billion.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nOperating margin for the quarter was 19.5%, down 0.1 percentage points in the previous quarter and down 0.1 percentage points year over year. Non-TFRS operating margin for the quarter was 19.9%. Net income for the quarter was NT$ 28.1 billion, down 5% sequentially and up 8.1% year over year. Non-TFRS net income for the quarter was NT$ 28.6 billion. Net profit margin for the quarter was 18.7%, down 0.6 percentage points from the previous quarter and down 1.7 percentage points year over year. Non-TFRS net profit margin for the quarter was 19%. EPS for the quarter was NT$ 17.5, down from NT$ 18.43 in the previous quarter and up from NT$ 16.19 in the year-ago quarter. Non-TFRS EPS for the quarter was NT$ 17.81. A reconciliation table for our TFRS and non-TFRS financial measure is attached in our press release for your information, and that concludes my comments. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, David. Now, I would like to turn the call to CEO Dr. Rick Tsai for prepared remarks.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nGood afternoon, everyone. MediaTek's second quarter revenue grew 4.4% sequentially and 23.8% year over year in US dollars. We attribute this largely to the strong business foundation we have built in the past few years. In the second quarter, we continue to see higher structured demand for edge AI SoCs and faster connectivity. To a lesser extent, we also noticed some pooling demand amid trade uncertainties. We are on track with our mid to long-term growth journey. Our diverse existing businesses and growth initiatives underpin a robust foundation for MediaTek. In 2025, several businesses are demonstrating strong growth momentum, including flagship smartphones, connectivity portfolios, and computing devices. While we anticipate revenues from our major growth initiatives, such as data center ASIC projects, to start ramping next year. Our mobile phone business performs solidly with continuous expansion into the flagship segment.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe expect the flagship smartphone revenue to reach $3 billion this year, representing an annual growth rate of more than 40%. Our leading connectivity portfolio, such as Wi-Fi 7, 5G modem, and 10G PON, continues to gain shares in global telecom operators and leading consumer electronics players. We expect our connectivity business to grow strongly, with revenue exceeding $3 billion this year. Furthermore, revenue from our computing solutions, which currently include tablets, Chromebooks, and the GB10 project that we collaborate with NVIDIA, is expected to grow more than 80% this year to approximately $1 billion, driven by strong AI demand. Moreover, we are fully focused on executing and expanding our growth initiatives, such as enterprise ASICs and automotive businesses, each representing more than $40 billion revenue TAM in the mid to long term.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe business momentum for our enterprise ASICs is very strong, as CSPs continue to evaluate and adopt ASICs to enhance data center efficiency. To capture the increasing opportunities, we are rapidly expanding our R&D resources for the ASIC team, especially for recruiting key talents. These resources are being deployed mainly to advanced nodes, advanced packaging technologies, and next-generation IPs, such as 400G, 48G service, and CPO. Backed by our robust service IP portfolio and strong execution capability, we currently have multiple engagements with global CSPs for data center ASIC. We believe in our ability to add value to this fast-growing market. We continue to expect sizable revenues starting next year. For automotive, we have been making very good progress in securing design wins for our Dimensity Auto high-end and mainstream cockpit and telematics solutions.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe more advanced cockpit solution, CX-1, which we co-developed with NVIDIA to support premium vehicles, will be sampling to customers soon in the second half of the year. We expect revenue from CX-1 to start in 2026, adding momentum to our automotive business, which has already been growing robustly. Furthermore, to support our strong roadmap for enhancing advanced AI functions and overall performance, we are aggressively investing in two-nanometer advanced process for both of our edge AI and cloud AI products. Our first two-nanometer tape-out is scheduled for September of this year, positioning us to be among the leading group launching two-nanometer chips. These exciting developments reinforce our confidence in capturing growth opportunities in the mid to long term. With that, now let me talk about the recent business performance for our three revenue groups.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMobile phones accounted for 52% of total second quarter revenue and grew 13% year over year and declined 9% quarter over quarter. In US dollars, this revenue group grew 19% year over year and declined 3% sequentially. As I said earlier, our share gains in the flagship segment continue to drive year-over-year business growth, mainly thanks to the successful Dimensity 9400 family. Since the introduction of the Dimensity 9400 last year, we have enabled numerous popular flagship AI smartphones from Oppo, Vivo, and Redmi to gain share in the market. To extend the momentum, we will soon be launching the next-generation flagship SoC, Dimensity 9500, in the third quarter. Dimensity 9500 will deliver even more enhanced AI functions with more powerful computing capabilities. We have secured more customers and model adoptions than the previous generation.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFor the third quarter, we expect flagship revenue to grow as Dimensity 9500 enters mass production, while demand for the mainstream segment is expected to slow down amid global economic uncertainties. Now, let me move on to smart edge platforms. In the second quarter of 2025, this group grew 26% year over year and grew 7% sequentially, accounting for 43% of revenue. In US dollar terms, this revenue group grew 32% year over year and 14% quarter over quarter. The sequential growth was mainly from the continuous ramp of AI-capable. Computing devices. Share gain in consumer ASICs and some pooling demand. AI-capable computing devices have been well received in the market and fueled our business momentum. We are glad to see all the major Android tablet brands, including Samsung, adopting MediaTek AI chips for their premium AI tablets this year.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nLenovo also announced a premium AI Chromebook powered by MediaTek's three-nanometer Companion Ultra SoC in the second quarter. Moreover, GB10, the chip we co-developed with NVIDIA to power NVIDIA's AI supercomputer, DGX Spark, is scheduled to begin mass production in the third quarter. For the third quarter, this group continued to benefit from share gains in 5G modem, premium AI tablets, and automotive with year-over-year growth. However, as some demand has been pulled to the first half of the year, we expect smart edge platforms' revenue to decrease quarter over quarter. Now, moving on to Power IC, which accounted for 6% of total revenue in the second quarter and grew 11% year over year and grew 17% quarter over quarter. In US dollar terms, this revenue group grew 16% from the same period last year and 24% sequentially.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn the second quarter, Power IC benefited from share gains and better demand. We expect Power IC revenue to decline sequentially in the third quarter on lower consumer electronics demand. Moving into the third quarter of 2025, we are excited at the ramp of Dimensity 9500 and GB10. We also expect the growth momentum from AI tablets and automotives to continue in the third quarter. However, as some demand has been pulled into the first half of the year and resulted in a different quarterly pattern, we expect the third quarter revenue to decline sequentially. With that, we expect our third quarter revenue to be in the range of TWD 130.1 billion-TWD 140 billion, down 7%-13% sequentially, and down 1% to up 6% year over year.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAt a forecasted exchange rate of TWD 29.1 to $1 USD, compared with the exchange rate of TWD 30.90 to $1 USD in the second quarter. The impact from the potential exchange rate difference on our third quarter NT dollar revenue outlook is approximately 6%. As nearly all of our revenue is in US dollar, we also provide our third quarter revenue guidance in US dollar to fairly reflect the business situation. In US dollar terms, our third quarter revenue will be in the range of $4.49 billion-$4.83 billion, down 1%-8% sequentially, and up 10%-18% year over year. Gross margin for the third quarter is forecasted at 47%, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. Quarterly operating expense ratio to be at 31%, plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFinally, I would like to reiterate our strong commitment in investing in growth areas such as AI, data center, and automotive, which are still at their initial phases of market development. We believe their growth potentials are strong enough to help us weather short-term volatilities. We remain confident in our technologies and our capability to grow in the midterm to long term. This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Rick. Operators are now ready for Q&A session. May we please have the first question?\n\n**Operator**\nYes. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now in question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. Please ask your questions after your name is announced. Please limit your questions to two at a time to allow more participants to join the discussion. After two questions, we will move to the next caller.\n\n**Operator**\nShould you have more questions, please press star one to come back to the queue. To cancel your question, please press star two. Thank you. As a reminder, it is greatly appreciated that you turn off speakerphone mode of your device to prevent possible echo effect. We thank you for your cooperation. Our first question is coming from Sunny Lin, UBS. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Analyst)\nThank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is on ASIC side. Could you share with us a bit more color on your progress to run more projects in the coming few years? You talk about good revenue contribution for 2026 and the update on the revenue opportunity versus your prior guidance of $1 billion. Beyond that, maybe more importantly, is there an inflection point when we should expect maybe more meaningful uplift as you start to run more projects? Thank you very much.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOn ASIC side, we remain confident that we will do our revenue forecast for late next year. We believe our customer is doing well in their taking out progress. In addition, we are also engaging with various potential CSP customers for various applications. We feel good about our opportunities in moving forward. We look forward to, as I said a couple of times in the prepared remarks, we expect strong growth from the data center ASIC business in the coming years. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Analyst)\nSorry, just a very quick follow-up. Since most investors are quite paying attention to the $1 billion target for 2026, so now maybe given some hiccup on the tape-out in the short term, should we assume maybe a bit lower contribution for 2026, but then going to 2027, you should certainly scale to a much higher number for 2027?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAs I said, I just said now, we remain confident that we will do our revenue forecast for late 2026. We believe our 2027 number will be good, but I do not know how to compare to what you have in your forecast. 2027 will definitely bring quite a bit of growth from the ASIC business. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Analyst)\nGot it. No problem. Thank you very much. My second question is on your process development. I'm pretty glad to see that MediaTek is being pretty fast in two-nanometer process migration, maybe starting from flagship smartphone SoCs, basically in the same product generation as iOS. I wonder what's giving you the confidence for such quick process migration. Could you share with us maybe the key benefits for the two-nanometer process migration? Is it more on the performance or more on the power efficiency?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMaybe just say something about two-nanometer first, where both performance and power efficiency will improve quite a bit, especially in the power efficiency part. It's critical for, for instance, the flagship SoC business and the market requirements. It's critical. Not to mention, of course, with the data center ASIC business coming up. People are just moving as fast as they can into the advanced process nodes. Now, why MediaTek is now moving into two-nanometer process node at almost the same pace as the other major world-class tier one companies. I have all the sense for our technical people, managers, engineers, together with really close collaboration with our foundry partner, TSMC. I cannot say enough to thank them. After several years, really hard and intelligent work from our people and TSMC, this is where we are. We expect nothing less in the forthcoming nodes.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe certainly will continue to invest and will reap the benefits from next-generation process node also. Thank you.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Next one, Laura Cheng, CD, go ahead, please.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nThank you. Thank you for taking my question. Good afternoon. My question is also about the AI and obviously quite positive on the growth in the longer term. May I just also follow up? When we see that 2027, you will see quite strong growth for the AI accelerator growth. It's mainly from the one single specific CSP, or do we see more than just one AI ASIC contribution happening in the year of 2027?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nLaura, we cannot comment specifically how many customers we will be reaping revenues from in 2027. Suffice to say that we are engaging aggressively with multiple CSPs.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI would say the revenue growth from the first customer will be, I believe, very robust. We are really working diligently to see whether we can add more revenue sources, but we cannot comment any further right now. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nSure, certainly. Also, my second question is about our business model. I recall that previously on the AI ASIC project, we did mention that we are more flexible in terms of our cooperation with the client. Do we see that for the following projects, what kind of role we are doing versus our US peers or Asian peers? Are we still more in charge of the services, or can we also be in charge of the full design, including the top line and also the full process?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think there are two aspects to your question. One is the business model. The other one is the capability.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFrom a capability point of view, we are confident that we can perform all the way, not only analyzing, specifying models. We are capable from the IPs to, of course, the design, this very complex design, technology capability and advanced packaging technology capabilities, not to mention the very strong execution capability. Yes, we are confident we can. On the other hand, from a business model point of view, we remain flexible, as I said previously. We work with customers closely. The chip architecture now is very complex, so there are various ways to accommodate, to serve our customers even within one chip architecture. Without further going into the details, what I can say is we really work closely and provide customers with not only flexibility from the beginning and during the process. If customers need to change or modify their model, we just jump ahead to meet their request.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI truly believe this is really a win-win business model for customers and MediaTek. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Analyst)\nSure. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Next one, Gokul Hariharan, JP Morgan. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Co-Head of APAC TMT Research)\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just to clarify something on the enterprise ASIC or data center ASIC, Rick, I think in February you had mentioned this project for next year will start in first quarter or second quarter next year and reach a $1 billion revenue, excluding HBM. Are we still largely sticking to this timeline? It looks like the timeline is a little bit later based on your current commentary, but you're still sticking to that $1 billion even if the timeline is later. Is that a fair representation?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe are working very closely with our customers to ensure the tape-out, a good time for tape-out, later this year in the latest quarter.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe are doing everything we can. We are preparing everything in advance to ensure seamless execution after the tape-out. We feel confident that we can really run this tape-out into early production next year, starting roughly latest quarter next year. We strive to achieve that $1 billion target, as I said before. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Co-Head of APAC TMT Research)\nOkay, got it. I just wanted to understand because I think first time we talked about this project, we were expecting this to start production in 2025. Obviously, there have been some delays. What is the reason for these delays in your perspective? How do you characterize this? When you talk about longer-term visibility, how do you factor in some of these kinds of changes which are quite unique to the ASIC business into that longer-term opportunity?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nGokul, David here. First of all, I want to clarify.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think starting from the beginning, I do not recall we made any comment talking about the revenue start from 2025. I think we talked about the major ones actually 2026. We never talked about 2025. The second part, actually, I understand, especially some people worry about the hiccup. When we give out the revenue guidance for next year, rest assured we are also factoring in some of the potential hiccup as well. So, actually, the hiccup is within the original guidance or original range. That is why, I guess, you are wondering why even though there is some hiccup, the revenue target did not really change. I think that is the major reason.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Co-Head of APAC TMT Research)\nIs there a risk that this project will see some scale down given that your competitor also has a project which is of larger scale? How do we assess that risk?\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Co-Head of APAC TMT Research)\nOr is that risk already factored into your guidance?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think so far, again, because we are talking about ramping up really late third quarter next year. Even in the worst case, if the overall scale is coming down, it will not impact next year's revenue. It may impact your lifetime, which was 2027, 2028. Okay. For the NPI, the new product introduction, you just need to start enough wafer to start with.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe positioning of different chips is quite different for customers' data center use. We remain, again, confident that our chips will have really very good growth in the coming years. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Co-Head of APAC TMT Research)\nThanks. Thanks, Rick. Maybe my second question is on the automotive side. You seem to be seeing more and more traction on the smart cockpit, telematics. Could we talk a little bit about what kind of revenues can we expect from auto?\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Co-Head of APAC TMT Research)\nCan we hit a billion dollars next year, or is that going to be like 2027? Any kind of quantification? Second, I think the trend seems to be to integrate ADAS into the smart cockpit and make it one SoC in the next couple of years. Could we talk a little bit about what is MediaTek doing on the ADAS side? Are you already having in-house IP which you can integrate, or are you partnering with somebody else?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nGokul, I think for the billion dollar revenue target, I think we probably will not be able to make it next year. Okay. Even though we do see very strong revenue growth year over year, I guess we still probably need two to three years to see that benchmark. For next year, we will not see a billion dollars.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nFrom the design in and design win, or maybe just the backlog perspective or design pipeline perspective, I think it all looks actually pretty healthy and solid.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYour question, Gokul, about the ADAS and your—of course, you are right about the ADAS and the coming architecture of having ADAS and the cockpit chip in one SoC. For now, you certainly know that we are focusing on cockpit and telematics, where we have built, I would say, very solid and very strong foothold already. Especially, I am quite happy with our latest development with our top-of-the-line cockpit chip, CX-1. It should start generating revenue next year, late next year. As far as the ADAS is concerned, we are working—I should say, working with certain customers to build the ADAS chip. That is all I can say.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWith that, we are quite confident. We are very confident that we will move into the ADAS field sometime soon. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Co-Head of APAC TMT Research)\nThanks.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThank you. Next one, Felix Pan, KGI. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Felix Pan** (EVP and Head of Global Semiconductor Research)\nHi. Good afternoon. Rick, David, and JC. Two questions from me. First of all, for the N2's progress, we are at the same pace as our competitors moving to the N2. As we know, the consumption for the smartphone is pretty weak from year to date, even with some subsidies. I just wonder that, how likely your customer to transfer the costs for the migration to the customer? Is that the consumption can bear with this kind of the cost increase? That's my first question. Second question will be the AI ethic. I think in the early days, I think maybe one company can do all the service from the computing die, I/O die, service.\n\n**Felix Pan** (EVP and Head of Global Semiconductor Research)\nNow we see more and more players jumping into the place. We see some business model like the people doing service, people doing the computing die. How do you see the trends going forward? Any color will be grateful. That's my question. Thanks.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe mobile flagship SoCs, there's no doubt in our mind that the 2 nanometer will be in the mainstream for the flagship. No doubt in our mind. The demand, the user experiences, requirements, all points that way. By the way, I think the smartphone market is not growing big, but it's not doing poorly either. I think it's about the same as last year, for instance. Acquire the share of the flagship phone has gone steadily higher every year. That was also part of the reason our share in the flagship SoC continued to grow also.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe 2 nanometer with its power consumption benefits and the superior performance is really a perfect fit. There's no replacing for that for the next generation flagship SoC for the mobile domain. Now, on the ASIC part. I think you hit it right on that the data center ASIC is getting more and more and much more complex as the requirement for the computing power, for the power consumption requirements, for the very high-speed interconnect up and out, all demand a tremendous technology capability. From computing area, either the custom-designed computing chip or the XPU kind of a computing chip. Although we believe the custom computing chip will occupy the majority of the ASIC market for data center. The other demand for the extremely fast interconnect, which, of course, everybody's moving from 200G to 400G. Not everybody. Very few people can do that, by the way. Only very few.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nMoving on, and MediaTek is one of the very few who can do that. We also need to invest in the CPO as the next step after 400G. And even. As importantly or more importantly, the advanced XGEN technology, the 2.5D, very large chip size XGEN capability is a must. Together, probably also with the 3.5D packaging technology. These are very difficult, but also a must for the data center to achieve, to produce the computing power, the tokens per second at a reasonable power consumption and the TCO. MediaTek, I would say, is one of the very few who can and who will fulfill all those very, very challenging technology requirements and the business model flexibility. Thank you.\n\n**Felix Pan** (EVP and Head of Global Semiconductor Research)\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Next one, Brett Simpson, Erytek. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nYeah, thanks very much. I had a near-term question and a long-term question.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nI guess first up on a near-term, can you maybe just clarify the smartphone outlook for Q3? I think you said flagship would grow, but is overall smartphone sales growing sequentially in Q3? I guess we're coming off a period of subsidies in China, particularly mid-range, low-end. We're seeing cutbacks in subsidy. Can you maybe share with us your perspective on how you think China consumer demand plays into second half? Do you anticipate any inventory builds? Directionally, would you expect sequential growth in Q4 for smartphones? Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nFirst things first, overall, I think we see a pretty healthy and normal inventory situation in the marketplace, both actually for our customer and also for channel inventory. It's healthy and props to normal and probably closer to the lean. For third quarter specifically, due to our flagship ramping up, we see a very strong revenue run for our flagship.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nFor mainstream and also the entry level, I would say probably flat to down a bit. Overall, I think for the market momentum, I would use the word probably healthy. I won't say it's strong, but it's really definitely healthy, and partially due to the incentive programs and also the product migrations in the marketplace.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nJust on that, David, you're shipping 9500 a little bit earlier than we would have expected into Q3. Does that take away, does that change your thinking on Q4? I mean, would you expect smartphones to grow in Q4, just directionally?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for flagship specifically, the ramping starts from Q3, but it's not going to stop at Q4. You will continue from Q3, Q4, actually all the way to Q1. I think basically that's the cadence and ramping up cycle for flagship.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nOkay. Great. Thanks. Maybe for Rick, I just wanted to.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nA multi-part question on the NVIDIA relationship for MediaTek and where you think this is going. Maybe just first of all, the scope of this partnership, I'd love to understand how much headcount you're assigning to this opportunity. Does the opportunity with NVIDIA extend to collaborations on 400G servers? I know you're working with NVIDIA on autonomous vehicles. Does that extend into robotics? Can you maybe just talk at a high level about how you're thinking about this relationship? In terms of the business model with NVIDIA, obviously, you're starting to ramp the GP10 this quarter. Can you give us a sense as to how this translates to revenues and whether the business model with NVIDIA is accretive or dilutive to corporate EBIT margins? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAll right. Let me get my head straight first. It is truly a multi-part question. Let me start with our NVIDIA collaboration model.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe have two very active, and I would say up to now quite successful, business collaborations. One being the ARM computing chips, which you just mentioned, GP10. It will be shipped very soon in the third quarter. The other one being the cockpit chips in the autonomous vehicles. As I said, the CX-1, I just mentioned in my remarks, was developed through the collaboration with NVIDIA. Both companies are putting a lot of resources. We obviously do. We're putting resources, well, around this thousand a year, roughly. Saying all that, these are just the beginning of this, I would say, very promising and mutually beneficial collaboration model. As I would certainly believe Jensen also believes in, the business model varies from different business segments. Some business, NVIDIA owns the promotion and the go-to-market, for instance, for GP10, and some we do, like for the automotive chips.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe impact, I think, the added value for both companies is very positive. In this time of the very robust demand for all kinds of AI capability, one key bottleneck is the resources. In this way, both companies can, in this collaboration model, both companies can achieve more with the existing resources. The created value, I think, will be obvious for both companies. Thank you.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nThank you.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Partner and Co-Founder)\nThank you. Next one, Bruce Liu, Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nHello. Thank you for taking my question. Again, my question is still for the ASIC. I think Rick has just mentioned that customer ASIC has different positioning, right?\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nDo you see any changes in terms of the positioning for the ASIC chips moving forward, i.e., that in the past, there is a rule of thumb that training is for GPUs and inference for ASIC, but it sounds to me that there are certain changes for that. Do you see a clear positioning for ASIC in inference or reasoning, or is it also because of competition? I mean, if the customer ASIC cannot really compete with GPU in certain, or in their previous planning, do you see that change their addressable market for you and for your customers?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nBruce, I will not act as a data center expert myself. We are, however, only an ASIC chip supplier. As we have engaged with multiple parties in the business, I think we can calculate the TAM. For instance, for the ASIC, the customer ASIC is customer, of course, business.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI believe the number we have been quoting is $40 billion TAM. Actually, if you look at different parties, we are probably on the low side of the TAM. I would say from that point of view, we are certainly not too aggressive. The other thing I think is quite sure is the customer chip being customer chip, the most important thing is the customers understand their workload requirement because they know the best, and so that they can custom build certain chips more efficiently than a general purpose accelerated AI chip. Both are critical. Both will remain more than viable for the data center industry.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI do not think there is any question to that. It is just the reality of the data center industry requires the large CSPs to build their own customer silicon so that they have a certain portfolio of their capacity or capability to be more efficient and more potentially cost and power efficient. The ratio of their planning for different either training or reasoning or inferencing really also depends greatly on, again, their business outlook, and it is very difficult for us to comment truthfully. Thank you.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nJust a quick follow-up on this. The reason we want to know that is that we want to know whether this hiccup would be there due to technical difficulty or any changes in terms of the positioning, any changes in the competition landscape, or it is just simply that the chip is just a bit difficult.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nBruce, I think so far, what we see is actually, like you say, from the market competition perspective, there is no material change in the last few quarters. I think you can rest assured that some of the delay or whatever is not due to what you talk about, the competition. Yeah.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nI see. I understand. Thank you. Okay. The second thing is that for the profitability into next year, as you might know, we have ASIC chips going up. Even with a billion-dollar TSMC raising the price. Are we still comfortable with our gross margin to be stable for next year and onwards at the current range?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think due to the different business model and also the accounting, I think probably the better way we talked about earlier is going to be operating margin accredited.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nThat is specific for ASIC business, right?\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nIn terms of overall revenue for overall gross margin for next year,\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think if you put it aside with the business model perspective, I think the outgoal is still trying to stabilize the gross margin.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nI see. I understand. Regardless of the pricing, wafer price or cost and different product mix, right?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYep.\n\n**Bruce Lu** (Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Next one, Arthur Lai, Macquarie. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Head of Technology Research)\nHi. Hi, Rick and David. I'm great. MediaTek makes many new product commercially soon. My question will follow on GP10 and also ASIC. Number one, I think just one NSX about GP10. I think investor issue is still underappreciated in the partnership you make with NVIDIA. Can you share with us under the concept of partnership, how you do this partnership sharing? Also, will we see more to go on this partnership? That is my first question. Thanks.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for the GP10, basically, it's NVIDIA owned the product. They sell the product to the marketplace, and we get paid in return. In terms of the sharing, we will not be able to share some more detail. Yeah.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Head of Technology Research)\nOkay. Got you. Thank you. Second one is more on ASIC revenue. We understand that there's a lot of discussion on ASIC. In the future, can the company have more disclosure on breakdown on ASIC? Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI'm sorry. Can you repeat your question again? You mean breakdown?\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Head of Technology Research)\nYeah. The financial report in the future, can you give us more breakdown, the subsegment breakdown, for example, Smart Edge, Smart Home, and also the ASIC. Breakdowns on the revenue side?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYeah. For next year, actually, we will have our final decision. Yeah.\n\n**Arthur Lai** (Head of Technology Research)\nOkay. Thank you. No more questions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Next one, Brad Lin, Bank of America. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Brad Lin** (Director)\nOh, thank you for squeezing me in. I have two questions. They are basically long-term questions. The first question would be on the long-term outlook, say, into 2027 or 2028, do we have any revenue or profitability target for the firm, reached by reaching a certain level from the non-consumer electronics, for example, ASIC, or things like automotive, robotics? Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nYep. Great. I think we can provide probably the direction, no guidance, but we won't be able to provide the detailed guidance, especially if given overall dynamic of the market. I think, like we talked about earlier, starting from this year and next year, we see multiple sectors of growth opportunity: ASIC, AISIC, automotive, wearable, and computing. So we do believe, actually, we're seeing real new continued growth all the way from 2027 and 2028. I think that's what we've seen so far.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nBut in terms of detailed breakdown by different contribution, we will not be able to provide detail right now.\n\n**Brad Lin** (Director)\nSure. Got it. Thank you very much. My second question would be, we sort of mentioned that it's on the engineering resource. We have learned the resource is really tight, and the cost, the expense is also getting higher with the growing AI demand. Are engineering resources a potential bottleneck to MediaTek's business upside? If that is, when will that be, and how does MediaTek handle the risk? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAgain, there are two aspects to it. Number one is the resources by itself. It is tight, yes. As I believe, that is the kind of industry-wide phenomenon. The one thing we are doing is to have really these resources are corporate. We have a corporate resource planning to prioritize our chip resources and to also retain outside resources in addition.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe second part of the resources is the ability to improve the design technology, thus the resulting design productivity so that we can certainly do a lot more with our current resources plus the future. We are, of course, hiring the design resources. There's no stopping in that regard. Both of these, we believe we will, what we will do is to ensure the best growth for the company. 2026, 2027, 2028, and beyond. We will ensure the resources are being spent to achieve our future growth for the company. Thank you.\n\n**Brad Lin** (Director)\nNoted. Thank you, Rick. Thank you, David.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to take the last one. Next one, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Technology and Semiconductors Research Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question, Rick, David, JC. My first question is also on ASIC.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Technology and Semiconductors Research Analyst)\nI believe without your help, your key customers cannot execute this well to tape out on time. Congratulations on that. My question is about your second largest project, meaning, what would make your customers not choose you, right? MediaTek, you have engineering resource, great foundry relationship, also very competitive operation, right? What would make a customer not choose you to do this ASIC design service? I mean, for the second largest US CSP customer.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nCharlie, as I said a couple of times, we are engaging with various large CSPs. We appreciate your comments about our capabilities, and we also believe we do possess those capabilities. The decision, of course, rests with the customer, and we remain quite, shall we say, hopeful.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nNo matter what, I think for MediaTek, I believe we have proven ourselves to be not only a viable but also a very competitive ASIC supplier for the whole industry, data center industry. I do not believe we should just constrain ourselves to this or that opportunity. There are, and there will be, plenty of opportunities which will enable our future growth. I'm absolutely confident in that. Thank you.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Technology and Semiconductors Research Analyst)\nOkay. Great. Yeah. Looking forward to your next success. The next one is, I guess, easier. It's about your full-year revenue guidance in USD. I appreciate that company uses US dollars to reflect your real operation. When you provide a full-year US dollars revenue guidance, can you also extend the implied first-quarter seasonality? Thank you.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nCharlie, if we're looking beyond the seasonality for the full year based on the US dollars, I think we still feel comfortable looking for EOV or growth, meaning growth, for the full year.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Technology and Semiconductors Research Analyst)\nOkay. Okay. Would that imply first-quarter to be slight to upsizing? And what would be the driver behind?\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nI think for the quarterly patterns, actually, right now, it's hard to comment. I think for the full year, it probably will be easier.\n\n**Charlie Chan** (Technology and Semiconductors Research Analyst)\nOkay. Great. Much appreciated for squeezing my questions. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for all your questions. Now, I'll hand it over to Ms. Jessie Wang for closing comments. Ms. Wang, please go ahead.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes MediaTek 2025 second-quarter conference call. The audio replay will be available in one hour after the call at the investor session of MediaTek's website.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nWe would like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThank you, Ms. Wang. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Thank you again.",

That concludes my comments. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, David. I would like to turn the call to our CEO, Dr. Rick Tsai, for prepared remarks.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. MediaTek delivered solid Q1 results. Our Q1 revenues reflected the structured mix enhancements driven by increasing AI and Wi-Fi 7 adoptions, as well as better-than-expected demand, partially due to tariff uncertainties. Gross margin for the Q1 was above the midpoint of the guidance range. Before we discuss our business, I would like to talk about the recent market environment. The evolving tariff situation has created uncertainties to almost all markets around the world. For the short term, as trade negotiations continue to unfold, we are closely observing their impact on global economies and working with our global supply chain partners and customers to navigate the uncertainties. In the meantime, we are carefully monitoring our inventories and managing our operations. For the mid to long term, we believe the trend toward ubiquitous AI remains intact, and our growth prospects remain solid.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nSupported by our robust balance sheet, we can continue focusing fully on the execution of new projects and investments in key technologies to further strengthen our competitive position. With the strategic values we created for our customers, we've continued to gain traction in several new areas by taking advantage of the AI megatrend. For enterprise ASICs, we are highly confident in our capabilities to design customer AI accelerators based on our key technologies and IPs, including the high-speed interconnect SerDes and others. Currently, we are engaging with more business opportunities as the industry continues to pursue highly customized solutions to enhance data center efficiency. Customers are reacting positively to our core value propositions, which include our capability to leverage the most advanced processing and packaging technologies to achieve the optimal performance, power, and area (PPA) entitlement.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn addition, our flexible business model allows our customers to combine various approaches, including Spec-in design, RTL-in design, and GDSII-in design, flexible HBM arrangements, and advanced packaging integration to optimize their total cost of ownership (TCO). We are on track to register a sizable annual revenue starting in 2026 and aim to continue making progress in this fast-growing market. Another example demonstrating our advanced technology capabil ity is a collaboration with NVIDIA on Uncertain, which is designed to power NVIDIA's DGX Spark, a small, powerful AI supercomputer that is welcomed by AI researchers and developers. DGX Spark delivers 1,000 AI TOPS of AI performance, allowing developers to prototype, fine-tune, and inference the latest generation of reasoning AI models with up to 200 billion parameters locally.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWith this proven record of our capability to design high-performance computing HPC chips, we're well positioned to explore various new applications in the future. For automotive, recently on our Dimensity Auto platform, we announced the 3-nanometer flagship cockpit solution, CX-1, and our latest telematics solution at the Shanghai Auto Show. Our cockpit solutions offer scalable hardware and software platforms with advanced AI capabilities. In addition, we are one of the few companies that can bring 5G technologies to cars. By leveraging these essential technologies for future connected cars and strong customer support, we are making very good progress in the auto market. We have established business relationships with the majority of Chinese auto OEMs and expanded our engagement with more global car makers. We continue to expect our auto revenue to grow quarter by quarter throughout 2025, with a growing number of product design wins that contribute to future revenue.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFurthermore, as AI applications continue to advance, we work closely with ecosystem partners to accelerate the proliferation of AI applications, especially for AI agents. The recently introduced standard protocols such as MCP, Model Context Protocol, and A2A agent-to-agent build seamless communications among AI agents, unleashing their potential. On top of that, with our recent upgrade of the GenAI tools, developers can more easily create AI applications for edge devices by simplifying development steps with easy-to-use interfaces. For example, edge AI agents with better privacy and security now can understand users' instant messages and automatically activate navigation service to direct users to their chosen destinations. With MCP, A2A, and MediaTek GenAI tools, we expect developers to create edge applications more efficiently for the market. We believe these AI innovations will enhance our product mix and shorten the smartphone replacement cycle.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWith that, now let me talk about the recent business performance for our three revenue groups. Mobile phones accounted for 56% of total revenue in the first quarter, growing 6% year over year and also 6% quarter over quarter. The sequential revenue increase was primarily driven by better demand in the mainstream and entry segments, while flagship demand came off slightly. Following the successful launch of our flagship SoC, Dimensity 9400, we recently added Dimensity 9400 Plus to the flagship portfolio, which further strengthened AI performance. Dimensity 9400 Plus supports all the popular large language models and adopts the latest techniques for faster reasoning speeds. We expect several Dimensity 9400 Plus-powered smartphones to hit the market in the Q2 Moreover, in the second half of the year, we will launch our next-generation flagship SoC, which has gained better traction with more customers than the previous ones.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe expect our strong flagship product lineup to continue gaining shares and enhancing our blended ASP as AI becomes more pervasive. For the Q2, thanks to more adoptions of our AI SoCs, Dimensity 9400 Plus, and Dimensity 8000 series, we will grow our business in the flagship and premium segments. However, as demand in mainstream and entry segments slowed down after the strong Q1, we expect mobile revenue to be flat to down quarter over quarter. Now let me move on to smart edge platforms. In theQ1 of 2025, this group grew 32% year over year and grew 23% sequentially, accounting for 39% of total revenue. The sequential growth was mainly due to product mix enhancements in both connectivity and computing devices, as well as some pooling demand.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFor smart edge platforms, the trend of connectivity technology upgrade and higher AI adoption continue to benefit our major platforms such as Wi-Fi and tablet. Our efforts in global market expansions are also gradually bearing fruit. As we move to the Q2, we see revenue growth in premium AI tablets, consumer ASICs, and automotive driven by share gain. These trends help us offset the effect of certain consumer products being pulled into the previous quarter. We therefore expect smart edge platforms' revenue to increase quarter over quarter. Now moving on to Power IC. This group accounted for 5% of total revenue in the first quarter, growing 7% year over year and declining 9% quarter over quarter due to seasonality. For the Q2, we expect our IC revenue to grow sequentially, mainly driven by share gains in certain consumer electronics, automotive, and data center.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nFor the Q2 of 2025, based on our current observations, overall supply chain inventory is still at a reasonably healthy level. Despite the market uncertainties, currently, there are no material order changes from customers, partly due to the long production cycle time. We expect our Q2 revenue to be flattish sequentially and to grow strongly year-over-year, driven by our structure mix enhancements across products. That said, uncertainty in the second half of the year remains high. With that, we expect our second quarter revenue to be in the range of TWD 147.2 billion-TWD 159.4 billion, down 4% to up 4% sequentially, and up 16%-25% year over year, at a forecasted exchange rate of 32.5 TWD to $1. Gross margin is forecasted at 47% plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nQuarterly operating expense ratio to be at 29% plus or minus 2 percentage points. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain very positive on our mid to long-term growth opportunities despite the recent uncertainties. We believe the growth areas that we are investing in, such as AI data center and automotive, remain at their initial phases of market development. The market potential could increase significantly with ongoing innovations, and the growth potential will not be impacted by the near-term volatilities. Given our strong competitiveness and early-stage presence in those areas today, we believe there is ample room for us to grow, and our strong balance sheet can support our dedication to new growth drivers during this uncertain time. This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Rick. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A session. May we please have the first question?\n\n**Operator**\nYes.Ladies and gentlemen, we are now in Q&A session. If you would like to ask questions, please press star key N1 on your telephone keypad. Please ask your questions after your name is announced, and please limit your questions to two at a time to allow more participants to join the discussion. After two questions, we will move to the next quarter. Should you have more questions, please press star key N1 to come back to the queue. In case you need to cancel your question, please press star key N2.\n\n**Operator**\nAs a reminder, it is greatly appreciated that you turn off the speakerphone mode of your device to prevent possible echo effect. We thank you for your cooperation. Now, please press star key N1 if you would like to ask questions. Thank you. The first one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan from JP Morgan. Go ahead, please. Yeah, hi. Good afternoon.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my question. My first question, I just wanted to understand. Usually, you give us some idea about how you think about the full-year growth in the April call. I just wanted to understand how you think about full-year growth for the company right now. First half, looking at the guidance and Q1, seems pretty strong. Second half, do recognize some of the uncertainties, but just wanted to get your thoughts on how should we think about full-year growth. And within that, if you see risks in second half, is there any particular area where you see more risk? Is it more on the smart edge side of the business, which is more US exposed, or you also are a little bit more conservative on the smartphone side of the equation?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. Let me respond to the second question first.Our exposure in the U.S. directly is around 10% of our revenue. You can say that the direct impact from the U.S. potential U.S. tariffs is more limited. However, of course, we are certainly watching very closely the potential impact to the overall economy of the other markets, such as China, Japan, Korea, etc.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThat is why we said, as many other CEOs have also, that we remain quite cautious about the second half of the year. The risks for us probably relied more in the consumer electronics, such as TVs or some of the home devices. Saying that, the first half is reasonably positive, as you know. The second half, again, because of uncertainty, we will not give, as we usually have, a full-year outlook this time. What I can say is, how should I say it? At least qualitatively, we are not overly pessimistic.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWe strive to achieve, I think, still a good, positive 2025. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nWould you say double digit is still kind of within the realm of your possibility? I know that you do not have a numerical guidance, but I think that seems to be where a lot of people are shooting for a couple of months before the Liberation Day tariffs were announced.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYou are right. We would be a bit more positive before the Liberation Day. Now, I would not use double digit now, but I would not definitely go down much either.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nUnderstood. That is a good range that most of us can work with. Thank you very much, Rick. My second question is, your longer-term ASIC preparation looks like you are getting more engagements. Could you talk a little bit about how you are? What are the nature of these engagements?\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nI think you've talked about high-speed service, your strong partnership with ARM as a couple of the important building blocks. During GTC, you also kind of alluded to some partnership on the IP side with your core partner, NVIDIA, as well. Could you talk a little bit about how these engagements are evolving right now? Are they mostly dealing with AI accelerator-related projects, or you also are expanding into other data center ASIC kind of opportunities also, if we think about the engagement level?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. I would first say, again, your latter part of the question, we are definitely focused on the AI accelerators, or in some other people call that XPUs, and customized AI accelerators. Saying that, the other, I think, concept, maybe concept is the right word for this business, is it is a very fluid business to be in. What do I mean by that?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThat means the major potential customers, the requirements for quote-unquote customized AI accelerators can vary quite a lot among different ones. The way we, I believe what we are being quite, I would not say successful yet, but the need for data. I believe we are being quite good in that we can combine our technology capability, our manufacturing capability—by manufacturing, I mean the really real advanced process packaging side—and our system architecture level of knowledge and the capability to engage with customers directly, plus, as I said in my remarks, a rather flexible business model approach. I think that makes us, you see, customize. By definition, you need to customize for different customers' specific requirements. I think we are doing that quite well from both a technical and a business point of view.Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Just one follow-up, Rick.You talked about spec in, RTL in, and GDSII in models as one of the flexible approaches. Is there any area which is more favorable to? Are you seeing anything in terms of these designs happening in the ASIC world, which is kind of a more favorable trend to MediaTek, or are there? It seems like the latter two are probably more favorable to MediaTek compared to full spec in, which used to be the kind of ASIC world for a long time.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI would say, I think Gokul, you're quite right that the latter two, the RTL in and the GDSII in, are probably more favorable to us from a business model point of view. However, again, it depends on the customer and the complexity of the chips they are pursuing. The first approach, we do have at least a discussion and engagement also. Thank you.\n\n**Gokul Hariharan** (Managing Director)\nGot it.Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Laura Chen from Citi.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Stock Analyst)\nHello. Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes. Yes\n\n**Laura Chen** (Stock Analyst)\n. Yes. Hi. Thank you. Thank you, Rick, for taking my questions. My question is also related to the AI ASIC development, probably also following what Gokul just mentioned that we know that during GTC, we announced to cooperate with NVIDIA on the NVLink IP. Does that mean that going forward, our ASIC or AI accelerator can also, aside from our service technology, we can also leverage NVLink to connect other GPU or accelerator?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes. We did have a good discussion engagement also with our partner, NVIDIA. The work is in its early stage, I would say. I would prefer to defer further discussion probably in another time. We are still in the process of kind of getting to more execution details. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Stock Analyst)\nYeah. Certainly.Also, following that, just wondering, our current AI ASIC or accelerator projects, we are aiming for next year ramping up, it's only based on our own service solution. Is that correct? It is correct. Yes. Okay. Can you give us more update about the current progress, any difficulties we may have, or in terms of the progress and ramping up schedule? Can you give us more color?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI would say in general, it's moving, progressing quite well. We're meeting all the milestones as required. In general, I foresee good progress also going forward. Please also understand, basically, these are very challenging technical projects. We certainly expect all kinds of challenges going forward. We do have the confidence that our team and our customers, we're working really closely and really well together, and we'll overcome any of them. I'm quite confident. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Stock Analyst)\nSure. Certainly.My second question, if I may, is that, again, it's also related to the AI ASIC. As we know that when it moves to more advanced nodes, like N2, for example, in the next two, three years, our customers may also want to consider the silicon photonics or CPO solutions. From MediaTek's perspective, do we have any plan or what's our roadmap to consider that from?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAbsolutely correct. CPO, basically, a co-packaged solution, first with the copper and then with the optics on the roadmap. It is, again, technically very challenging. We are, again, always two fronts of one is your customers, the other one being the partner from the technology suppliers. MediaTek, yes, we are investing, as I said in my remarks, we are continuing to invest. If anything, we are aggressively investing in those technology areas. We have all the means to do that. Thank you.\n\n**Laura Chen** (Stock Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one, we have Brett Simpson from Arete. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Controller)\nYeah. Thanks very much. I also had a question on the AI ASIC developments, Rick. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there's a sizable annual revenue opportunity in 2026. Can you maybe just elaborate what that means? Are we talking about kind of billion-dollar type levels? Have I got completely the wrong baseline? Any help there would be really, really helpful. I mean, it sounds like you are building more customers. I think previously you've said you've got a customer that will land next year. Can you maybe update us on the customer win? What wins you have today? Are you building off that single win that you've talked about previously? In terms of the business model, is this attractive enough from a margin perspective?\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Controller)\nIs it accretive to gross margins or operating margins? Any help would be great there. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes. David.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nOkay. Hey, Brad. First things first. I think right now, whatever we talk about for the next year, we expect a $1 billion revenue from the AI ASIC side. Right now, the target is not changed. I think the first thing first. The second part is actually talking about the customer. We probably won't be able to comment about anything about customer. We do actually have several deciding and decide wins. It's actually an ongoing process. That's my quick response. By the way, what's your third question? You're talking about?\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nMargin.\n\n**David Ku** (CFO)\nMargin. Okay. I think margins overall, again, because we have a different business model, overall, probably the best way to think about that is actually on the operating margin side will be accretive on the operating margin side.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Controller)\nOkay. Yeah. Great. Maybe just to follow up on the ASIC side, I guess when you look at the next two or three years, the industry is going through tremendous changes. Most companies are not just developing ASICs, but they're building rack solutions, including switching. I mean, I think there was a previous question on silicon photonics and optics. CPU as well is needed. To what extent is MediaTek planning to build system solutions? If that is the case, I mean, your investments here must be pretty significant. Can you maybe just share with us what sort of portion of your optics might be going towards AI ASICs? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nBrad, the investment certainly is now focused on the AI ASIC, AI accelerators, with the associated IPs and the technologies by IPs.The most obvious one, of course, is high-speed interconnect, including service and going forward, CPC and CPO. Of course, then all the DTCO capability using the N2 process. No, we call that STCO. It is advanced packaging technology from maybe different kinds of packaging technologies. The investment in those is already certainly quite extensive. I am again very confident that we will achieve quite well in them. On top of that, I would not say we will provide the system solutions. After all, that is not in our business model. What we certainly can do and will do is to already that we have the system knowledge and understanding and the capability of system architecture we have.\n\n**Operator**\nAshky. Your passcode has been confirmed. Please wait while you are joined to the conference.\n\n**Operator**\nARM's CSS platform for flagship devices.I think Xiaomi is one that's pretty well understood coming towards the end of this year. Can you talk a bit about how you see this trend evolving and what impact do you think it has on MediaTek's business? Do you still feel the flagship opportunities for sheer gains is as material as it has been? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes. Certainly. I mean, we've been working with our customers in your example, actually, to provide them so that they can have a system they can make and sell. The world is always evolving. MediaTek must adapt to the changing world as certainly our customers' requirements. We adapt. We provide our values. I'm totally confident. It's just kind of similar to our ASIC discussion just now. I have no question in my mind that we will provide invaluable values to our smartphone customers in China.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nDespite all the other people do different things, but MediaTek, at the end of the day, because of our focus, our resources, our talents, I think we will be successful in that particular segment, flagship SoC. Thank you.\n\n**Brett Simpson** (Controller)\nThank you. Thank you, Rick. Thanks, David.\n\n**Operator**\nRight now, we have Sunny Lin from UBS. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first point, I'll just start from the macro and also longer-term outlook. Now, with the escalating trade tensions, obviously, between China and the U.S., I know things are maybe in early stage. Are you seeing any signs of Chinese OEMs potentially hoping to adjust the procurement strategy just to reduce the exposure to the U.S. suppliers? Is that may benefit MediaTek? Anything you could share at this point will be very helpful.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nCertainly, certainly, I think we did not really observe any of those you mentioned. I think for the formal year, they are still being purchased at chips basically from globally, from U.S., from Taiwan. There is nothing changed out there yet.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nGot it. I have a question on the smartphone AI pursuity. Obviously, from 2024, you have been getting more mix from flagship and also higher silicon content. Dimensity 9400, the price is up quite a bit by 30-40% according to my estimate, in late 2024. I think you also get to pass through the TSMC cost inflation maybe this quarter by about mid-single digit. How should we think about the further upside for your Dimensity 9500? I also wonder for the flagship like D98000, would you expect maybe the silicon content to also go up anytime soon?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think for the flagship segment, what we're seeing right now this year, we're talking about the fourth generation of the smartphone. ASP is still continuing to go up. That should really help about the overall revenue growth and also the product mix growth. Other than the flagship, we talk about the mainstream because the 8000 series, you talk about, we see the ASP probably will be flattish year-over-year, maybe even down a little bit. I think with the exception of the flagship, all other segments probably just maintain the flagship ASP rather than increasing.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nGot it. If I could squeeze in one question on automotive.Would you be able to share a bit more updates on your engagement with the car makers, how many order backlogs that we have on hand, and what kind of adjustment market that you are expecting in the coming three or four years, and what kind of revenue contribution that we could expect maybe by 2026 or 2027, just like your disclosure for your cloud ASIC business ramping up to $1 billion in 2026?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think from the number of customers we're engaging or deciding to decide win, if you like, if this turn, it's actually growing really well, specifically in China and also globally as well. China currently is still the big part of our automotive business. From year-over-year growth perspective, we do expect very strong % growth.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIn terms of the absolute dollar, due to the SOP cycle on the automotive side, I think the revenue rate will be much slower in terms of the absolute dollar compared to the ASIC side. I think the revenue growth is a percentage. We're looking for very strong year-over-year growth both for this year.\n\n**Sunny Lin** (Stock Analyst)\nThank you very much. Got it. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nNow, questions from Jason CLSA.\n\n**Jason Tse** (Treasury Trader)\nHello. Can you hear me?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes. Hello.\n\n**Jason Tse** (Treasury Trader)\nThank you for taking my questions. My question is in terms of your long-term goals in the data center area. We found that you currently have AI ASIC or service technology. I think Airoha also announced 400G DSP. Also, Airoha has Ethernet switch or fi product. Can we integrate those kind of, no matter AI ASIC or those kind of connectors or high-speed product?\n\n**Jason Tse** (Treasury Trader)\nHi.This is Arete. May I have name, please? Joining the Ximing Shi. Hi. Hello. This is Arete. Anyone there? Joining the Ximing Shi. Waiting. How? Joining the Ximing Shi. 你是参加会议的还是你们还是你是直播那边的？ 那请问是哪一家公司？ 好。 好。谢谢.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nPercentage gap. For MediaTek AI ASIC, we're pretty much only focused on AI accelerators. That is the focus. The second part, we talked a bit about the China slash the opportunity. I think currently, we are looking for a global opportunity, which definitely including China as well.\n\n**Jason Tse** (Treasury Trader)\nOkay. Got it. Got it. My second question is in terms of the market shares in high-end smartphone. I think we already gained a lot of market shares in China brands. I wonder if we can further gain some of the design wins in Korea brands in the future, especially in the high-end sectors.How should we look at this kind of opportunity probably in second half or in next years?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIt's our policy. We won't come with specific customers. So we will not be able to comment on this question.\n\n**Jason Tse** (Treasury Trader)\nOkay. Got it. Got it. Yeah, I have no more questions. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Brad Lin from Bank of America.\n\n**Brad Lin** (DIRECTOR)\nOh, thank you for taking the question. I have two questions. My first question would be also on the GB10. Versus three months ago, what is the expectation on the GB10 in terms of the demand and contribution? What would be the revenue or, well, gross margin implication for MediaTek if these projects go well? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe GB10 is a collaborative product by NVIDIA and MediaTek. I think we had said before that NVIDIA is responsible for the products and the go-to-market.From that point of view, what we can say is the demand is very good, quite very strong with the targeted audience. I think the detailed outlook is better to refer to NVIDIA to answer. Thank you.\n\n**Brad Lin** (DIRECTOR)\nGot it. Got it. My second question would be on, an interesting product that they introduced by MediaTek recently, which is the, Chromebook processor, which is based on 3 nanometer. I can help by thinking what's the market position of such a product. It's 3 nanometer-based SoC, but competing in a lower-cost segment like Chromebook. Does that market, does that product potentially eye on the market share gain potentially from, x86 camp or, Qualcomm's current dominant ARM-based PC cap? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI think for the Chromebook, basically, one of the biggest segments will be on the education sector.We are actually getting the input from the customer. They are still looking for the high-end Chromebook. That is why we also have the 3 nanometer process. Whether or not they are actually competing, I am assuming you are assuming something called the Windows ARM. I do not think that is directly competing on that. It is more of an existing segment, but actually looking for the product upgrade.\n\n**Brad Lin** (DIRECTOR)\nGot it. Got it. With this kind of similar trend and also a broader strategy to bring the best nodes into, so-called, relatively mainstream or low-cost kind of a segment, could we expect similar transition maybe also in other segments like IoT?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nSorry, I cannot hear your question very clearly. What segment? Your last sentence?\n\n**Brad Lin** (DIRECTOR)\nI mean, as we have seen, MediaTek is introducing very advanced kind of technologies like a 3 nanometer into low-cost segments like Chromebook.Could we also expect similar kind of transition or upgrade in other key businesses of MediaTek like IoT?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nAs for IoT, we'll see the same trend as well because normally internal, we're using a core AP-based IoT, application processor-based IoT.\n\n**Brad Lin** (DIRECTOR)\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes. Maybe I can add one word. I cannot say it is definitely a trend, but in multiple fronts, by that I mean on the edge side, from smartphone, we just discussed Chromebook, IoT, but also tablets. The requirement for the high-end kind of premium models in those different segments, I mean, it's quite clear compared to, say, two years ago. Because of a very strong flagship SoC portfolio, we have been able to provide good solutions to those various high-end premium needs from various customers too. We're quite happy about it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley.\n\n**Charles Chan** (Research Analyst)\nHi. Good afternoon, Rick. And also, David, hope you can recover soon. My first question is about the AI smartphone development. I think, Rick, you mentioned about NCP being introduced, the accelerator, and GenAI. How soon do you think this kind of NCP can be adopted in the China smartphone ecosystem? I think it is developed by Anthropic. Yeah, just want to get a sense about how soon that can happen. I think privacy, I mean, it is a very important factor for HAI. Do you see any kind of killer apps or kind of privacy demand that is accelerating or, as you said, right, shorten the smartphone recruitment cycle in China?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nI do not claim myself to be an expert in agentic AI, but what we do observe pretty firsthand is that China's ecosystem in the agentic AI is blossoming. Many startups, plus these big, huge super app companies, are all in. When things happen this way, usually it will take a while to kind of settle, to take some time to settle. What we can tell from previous other experiences, in China, things will settle rather quickly. We have a very strong and a good relationship with many of those ecosystem players and the applications developers. We are providing the tools and the environment that they can build upon. I cannot say for sure, but I am sure you have also China for a long time. We can all expect things will happen very quickly over there.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nWhat we are doing is just to be there when they need it, to be actually ahead of them for all those tools so we can then gain our share of the business. Thank you. Yeah.\n\n**Charles Chan** (Research Analyst)\nThank you. Yeah. We look forward to that development. We believe that MediaTek will play a very important role for this ecosystem. My second question is really way back to your comments about ASIC. You sort of focused me on the required milestones, but there are some interchanges kind of sharing what we're saying, right? There are always some technical challenges to overcome. Rick, are you still confident that first half, you can still produce these major customers' projects, or you will buffer some time given those technical challenges? For the 2 nanometer project, do you have any visibility for the potential win? Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay.Again, number one, I'm confident in getting the project accomplished next year. By that, I mean we, so it's probably most practical to say we'll get those revenues late 2026. I think that's the most important thing at the end of the day. I think from a technology capability and all those things, it's really very complicated. We are not only on the right track, I think we're ready for those challenges. All right. Thank you.\n\n**Charles Chan** (Research Analyst)\nOkay. Sure, sure, sure. The worst case is late 2026 that you're keeping your targets to see some measure of health data, right?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nCharlie, I think you're right, but I don't quite understand what you mean by the worst case. I think that's how you're—\n\n**Charles Chan** (Research Analyst)\nOkay. Got you. Okay. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nNext one, we have Unknown from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.\n\n**Operator**\nYeah. Thank you for taking my question.Again, sorry, my question is for the ASIC business. When we do the analysis for ASIC business, there are two things always bother me. Number one is that you're working with customers. What if the project delay is caused by your customer, i.e., your customer fails to deliver the project, they have to complete it on time, which causes the delay, causes your revenue projection fall behind? How can we be confident that your customer can deliver the stuff on time? The second thing will be more longer term is that the ASIC chips, how does the competition with the merchant chips? How do you believe your customers are able to design a future chip which is able to compete with the merchant chips? Which merchant chip can have multiple chips with networking, with accelerator? It can be a total system performance thing.\n\n**Operator**\nWorking with one customer with one ASIC project might not be competitive in the longer term. How do you see these two factors in the ASIC business? How do you do the business plan in your ASIC business, though?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nActually, your question in a way to us is a generic one. ASIC being a business model, but the customers, whether customer can deliver on time or will, well, that is the same thing actually for our ASSP customer too. That is just a reflection. In our specific business currently, the thing to do and the thing that we are doing, just like other business, we work transparently, collaboratively, really closely with our customers. We know what they are doing. We know where they are. In any of the large-sized projects, I have not seen anyone without glitches. It is this mutual understanding and the trust we have built.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThe glitches happen on both sides. The thing I said just now is we are confident that we have the building capability to overcome those glitches and deliver. Your number two question is, smaller. GPU versus ASIC. Oh, okay. This is more kind of a more really data center, accelerator specific question. I'm sure you guys all observe and understand what the large CSPs are doing, not just thinking, are doing. There are obviously pros and cons for doing different kinds of models. I do not intend to jump into that debate myself, but it suffices to say that both models will work. I'm sure the merchant chips will continue to do well. The important thing really is to have the data center capacity to grow based on the demand. That growth will continue.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nIt is a matter of the proportion of that growth, of where they come from. I do not think there is any doubt about the need, the demand from the ASIC type of accelerator. I would not say I worry. What we work on, we strive basically to deliver. The business is there. Thank you.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nThank you. I just had a quick follow-up for the profitability because a lot of investors do ask that. We have a lot of negative factors for the margins, such as wafer price increase, ARM architecture license increase, or you are adopting more CSS model from ARM, which are all the negative factors for your gross margin. Are we still comfortable with our mid to long-term gross margin guidance, even with all the negative factors?\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nYes. We are confident.Number one, look, from the wafer price and all those things, there's an equal playing field. We are comfortable. I mean, I'm not saying I like the price increase, but we can comfortably deal with it. Other ARM and all those things, we have our capabilities, and we have our service model. We have a huge track record. Again, we focus on delivering what we committed. Then we will win more and more projects going forward.\n\n**Rick Tsai** (CEO)\nOkay. Thank you. Okay.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for all your questions. I'll hand it over now to Mr. Jessie Wang for a closing comment. Ms. Wang,please go ahead.\n\n**Jessie Wang** (Deputy Director of Investor Relations)\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes MediaTek 2025 first quarter conference call. An audio replay will be available in one hour after the call at the investor session of MediaTek's website.We would like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. .\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Jessie. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect now. Thank you, and goodbye.",
