With that, I will hand the call to Lisa.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. 2025 was a defining year for AMD, with record revenue, net income, and free cash flow driven by broad-based demand for high-performance computing and AI products. We ended the year with significant momentum, with every part of our business performing very well. We saw demand accelerate across the data center, PC, gaming, and embedded markets, launched the broadest set of leadership products in our history, gained significant server and PC processor share, and rapidly scaled our data center AI business as Instinct and ROCm adoption increased with cloud, enterprise, and AI customers. Looking at our fourth quarter, fourth quarter revenue grew 34% year-over-year to $10.3 billion, led by record EPYC, Ryzen, and Instinct processor sales.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nNet income increased 42% to a record $2.5 billion, and free cash flow nearly doubled year-over-year to a record $2.1 billion. For the full year, revenue grew 34% to $34.6 billion, and we added more than $7.6 billion of data center segment and client revenue. Turning to our fourth quarter segment results, data center segment revenue increased 39% year-over-year to a record $5.4 billion, led by accelerating Instinct MI350 series GPU deployments and server share gains. In server, adoption of 5th-gen EPYC Turin CPUs accelerated in the quarter, accounting for more than half of the total server revenue. 4th-gen EPYC sales were also robust, as our prior generation CPUs continued to deliver superior performance and TCO compared to competitive offerings across a wide range of workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs a result, we had record server CPU sales to both cloud and enterprise customers in the quarter and exited the year with record share. In cloud, hyperscaler demand was very strong as North American customers expanded deployments. EPYC-powered public cloud offerings grew significantly in the quarter, with AWS, Google, and others launching more than 230 new AMD instances. Hyperscalers launched more than 500 AMD-based instances in 2025, increasing the number of EPYC cloud instances more than 50% year over year to nearly 1,600. In the enterprise, we are seeing a meaningful shift in EPYC adoption driven by our leadership performance, expanded platform availability, broad software enablement, and increased go-to-market programs. The leading server providers now offer more than 3,000 solutions powered by fourth- and fifth-gen EPYC CPUs that are optimized for all major enterprise workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs a result, the number of large businesses deploying EPYC on-prem more than doubled in 2025, and we exited the year with record server sell-through. Looking ahead, server CPU demand remains very strong. Hyperscalers are expanding their infrastructure to meet growing demand for cloud services and AI, while enterprises are modernizing their data centers to ensure they have the right compute required to enable new AI workflows. Against this backdrop, EPYC has become the processor of choice for the modern data center, delivering leadership performance, efficiency, and TCO. Our next-generation Venice CPU extends our leadership across each of these metrics. Customer pull for Venice is very high, with engagements underway to support large-scale cloud deployments and broad OEM platform availability when Venice launches later this year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nTurning to our data center AI business, we delivered record Instinct GPU revenue in the fourth quarter, led by the ramp of MI350 series shipments. We also had some revenue from MI308 sales to customers in China. Instinct adoption broadened in the quarter. Today, 8 of the top 10 AI companies use Instinct to power production workloads across a growing range of use cases. With the MI350 series, we are entering the next phase of Instinct adoption, expanding our footprint with existing partners and adding new customers. In the fourth quarter, hyperscalers expanded MI350 series availability, leading AI companies scale their deployments to support additional workloads, and multiple neocloud providers launched MI350 series offerings that deliver on-demand access to Instinct infrastructure in the cloud.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nTurning to our AI software stack, we expanded the ROCm ecosystem in the fourth quarter, enabling customers to deploy Instinct faster and with higher performance across a broader range of workloads. Millions of large language and multimodal models run out of the box on AMD, with the leading models launching with day zero support for Instinct GPUs. This capability highlights our rapidly expanding open-source community enablement, including new upstream integration of AMD GPUs in vLLM, one of the most widely used inference engines. To drive Instinct adoption with industry-specific use cases, we're also adding support for domain-specific models in key verticals. As one example, in healthcare, we added ROCm support for the leading medical imaging framework to enable developers to train and deploy highly performant deep learning models on Instinct GPUs.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFor large businesses, we introduced our Enterprise AI Suite, a full-stack software platform with enterprise-grade tools, inference microservices, and solutions blueprints designed to simplify and accelerate production deployments at scale. We also announced a strategic partnership with Tata Consultancy Services to co-develop industry-specific AI solutions and help customers deploy AI across their operations. Looking ahead, customer engagements for our next-gen MI400 series and Helios platform continue expanding. In addition to our multi-generation partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 GW of Instinct GPUs, we are in active discussions with other customers on at-scale multi-year deployments starting with Helios and MI450 later this year. With the MI400 series, we are also expanding our portfolio to address the full range of cloud, HPC, and enterprise AI workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThis includes MI455X and Helios for AI superclusters, MI430X for HPC and sovereign AI, and MI440X servers for enterprise customers requiring leadership training and inference performance in a compact 8-GPU solution that integrates easily into existing infrastructure. Multiple OEMs publicly announced plans to launch Helios systems in 2026, with deep engineering engagement underway to support smooth production ramps. In December, HPE announced that they will offer Helios racks with purpose-built HPE Juniper Ethernet switches and optimized software for high-bandwidth scale-up networking. And in January, Lenovo announced plans to offer Helios racks. MI430X adoption also grew in the quarter, with new Exascale-class supercomputers announced by GENCI in France and HLRS in Germany. Looking further ahead, development of our next-generation MI500 series is well underway. MI500 is powered by our CDNA six architecture, built on advanced 2-nanometer process technology, and features high-speed HBM4e memory.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe are on track to launch MI500 in 2027 and expect MI500 to deliver another major leap in AI performance to power the next wave of large-scale multimodal models. In summary, our AI business is accelerating, with the launch of MI400 series and Helios representing a major inflection point for the business as we deliver leadership performance and TCO at the chip, compute tray, and rack level. Based on the strength of our EPYC and Instinct roadmaps, we are well positioned to grow data center segment revenue by more than 60% annually over the next three to five years and scale our AI business to tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027. Turning to client and gaming, segment revenue increased 37% year-over-year to $3.9 billion. In client, our PC processor business performed exceptionally well.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nRevenue increased 34% year-over-year to a record $3.1 billion, driven by increased demand for multiple generations of Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs. Desktop CPU sales set a record for the fourth consecutive quarter. Ryzen CPUs topped the bestseller lists at major global retailers and e-tailers throughout the holiday period, with strong demand across all price points in every region driving record desktop channel sellout. In mobile, strong demand for AMD-powered notebooks drove record Ryzen PC sell-through in the quarter. That momentum extended into commercial PCs, where Ryzen adoption accelerated as we established a new long-term growth engine for our client business. Sell-through of Ryzen CPUs for commercial notebooks and desktops grew by more than 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and we closed large wins with major telecom, financial services, aerospace, automotive, energy, and technology customers.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAt CES, we expanded our Ryzen portfolio with CPUs that further extend our performance leadership. Our new Ryzen AI 400 mobile processors deliver significantly faster content creation and multitasking performance than the competition. Notebooks powered by Ryzen AI 400 are already available, with the broadest lineup of AMD-based consumer and commercial AI PCs set to launch throughout the year. We also introduced our Ryzen AI Halo platform, the world's smallest AI development system, featuring our highest-end Ryzen AI Max processor with 128 GB of unified memory that can run models with up to 200 billion parameters locally. In gaming, revenue increased 50% year-over-year to $843 million. Semi-custom sales increased year-over-year and declined sequentially, as expected. For 2026, we expect semi-custom SoC annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage as we enter the seventh year of what has been a very strong console cycle.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFrom a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year, and development of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027. Gaming GPU revenue also increased year-over-year, with higher channel sellout driven by demand throughout the holiday sales period for our latest generation Radeon RX 9000 Series GPUs. We also launched FSR 4 Redstone in the quarter, our most advanced AI-powered upscaling technology, delivering higher image quality and smoother frame rates for gamers. Turning to our embedded segment, revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $950 million, led by strength with test and measurement and aerospace customers and growing adoption of our embedded x86 CPUs. Channel sell-through accelerated in the quarter as end-customer demand improved across several end markets, led by test, measurement, and emulation.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nDesign win momentum remains one of the clearest indicators of long-term growth for our embedded business, and we delivered another record year. We closed $17 billion in design wins in 2025, up nearly 20% year-over-year, as we've now won more than $50 billion of embedded designs since acquiring Xilinx. We also strengthened our embedded portfolio in the quarter. We began production of our Versal AI Edge Gen 2 SoCs for low-latency inference workloads and started shipping our highest-end Spartan UltraScale+ devices for cost-optimized applications. We also launched new embedded CPUs, including our EPYC 2005 Series for network security and industrial edge applications, Ryzen P100 Series for in-vehicle infotainment and industrial systems, and Ryzen X100 Series for physical AI and autonomous platforms. In summary, 2025 was an excellent year for AMD, marking the start of a new growth trajectory for the company.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe are entering a multi-year demand supercycle for high performance and AI computing that is creating significant growth opportunities across each of our businesses. AMD is well positioned to capture that growth, with highly differentiated products, a proven execution engine, deep customer partnerships, and significant operational scale. As AI reshapes the compute landscape, we have the breadth of solutions and partnerships required for end-to-end leadership, from Helios in the cloud for at-scale training and inference to an expanded Instinct portfolio for sovereign supercomputing and enterprise AI deployment. At the same time, demand for EPYC CPUs is surging as agentic and emerging AI workloads require high-performance CPUs to power head nodes and run parallel tasks alongside GPUs. At the edge and in PCs where AI adoption is just beginning, our industry-leading Ryzen and embedded processors are powering real-time on-device AI.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs a result, we expect significant top-line and bottom-line growth in 2026, led by increased adoption of EPYC and Instinct, continued client share gains, and a return to growth in our embedded segment. Looking further ahead, we see a clear path to achieve the ambitious targets we laid out at our financial analyst day last November, including growing revenue at greater than 35% CAGR over the next three to five years, significantly expanding operating margins, and generating annual EPS of more than $20 in the strategic time frame, driven by growth in all of our segments and the rapid scaling of our data center AI business. Now I'll turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our fourth quarter results and full-year results. Jean?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. AMD executed very well in 2025, delivering record revenue of $34.6 billion, up 34% year-over-year, driven by 32% growth in our data center segment and 51% growth in our client and gaming segment. Gross margin was 52%, and we delivered record earnings per share of $4.17, up 26% year-over-year while continuing to invest aggressively in AI and the data center to support our long-term growth. For the fourth quarter of 2025, revenue was a record $10.3 billion, growing 34% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in the data center and client gaming segments, including approximately $390 million in revenue from MI308 sales to China, which was not included in our fourth quarter guidance.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nRevenue was up 11% sequentially, primarily driven by continued strong growth in data center from both server and data center AI businesses, as well as a return to year-over-year growth in the embedded segment. Gross margin was 57%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. We benefited from the release of $360 million in previously written-down MI308 inventory reserves. Excluding the inventory reserve release and the MI308 revenue from China, gross margin would have been approximately 55%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by favorable product mix. Operating expenses were $3 billion, an increase of 42% year-over-year as we continue to invest in R&D go-to-market activities to support our AI roadmap and long-term growth opportunities, as well as higher employee performance-based incentives.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nOperating income was a record $2.9 billion, representing a 28% operating margin, tax increase, and other, resulting in a net expense of approximately $335 million. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was a record $1.53, an increase of 40% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution and operating leverage in our business model. Now turning to our reportable segment. Starting with the data center segment, revenue was a record $5.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year and 24% sequentially, driven by strong demand for EPYC processors and the continued ramp of MI350 products. Data center segment operating income was $1.8 billion, or 33% of revenue, compared to $1.2 billion, or 30% a year ago, reflecting higher revenue and the inventory reserve release, partially offset by continued investment to support our AI hardware and software roadmaps.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nClient gaming segment revenue was $3.9 billion, up 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong demand for our leadership AMD Ryzen processors. On a sequential basis, revenue was down 3% due to lower semi-customer revenue. The client business revenue was a record $3.1 billion, up 34% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, led by strong demand from both the channel and the PC OEMs and continued market share gains. The gaming business revenue was $843 million, up 50% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher semi-customer revenue and strong demand for AMD Radeon GPUs. Sequentially, gaming revenue was down 35% due to lower semi-customer sales. Client gaming segment operating income was $725 million, or 18% of revenue, compared to $496 million, or 17% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $950 million, up 3% year-over-year and 11% sequentially as demand strengthened across several end markets.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nEmbedded segment operating income was $357 million, or 38% of revenue, compared to $362 million, or 39% a year ago. Before I reveal the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the sale of ZT Systems manufacturing business to Sanmina in late October. The fourth quarter financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statement as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated a record $2.3 billion in cash from continuing operations and a record of $2.1 billion in free cash flow. Inventory increased sequentially by approximately $607 million-$7.9 billion to support strong data center demand. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment were $10.6 billion.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nFor the year, we repurchased 12.4 million shares and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders. We ended the year with $9.4 billion authorization remaining and our share repurchase program. Now turning to our first quarter 2026 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $9.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, including approximately $100 million of MI308 sales to China. At the middle point of our guidance, revenue is expected to be up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our data center and client gaming segments and modest growth in our embedded segment. Sequentially, we expect revenue to be down approximately 5%, driven by seasonal decline in our client gaming and embedded segment, partially offset by growth in our data center segment.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nIn addition, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 55%, non-GAAP operating expense to be approximately $3.05 billion, non-GAAP other net income to be approximately $35 million, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.65 billion shares. In closing, 2025 was an outstanding year for AMD, reflecting disciplined execution across the business to deliver strong revenue growth, increase profitability, and cash generation while investing aggressively in AI and innovation to support our long-term growth strategy. Looking ahead, we are very well positioned for continued strong top-line revenue growth and earnings expansion in 2026 with a focus on driving data center AI growth, operating leverage, and delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (VP of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations)\nYes. Thank you very much, Jean. Operator, please go ahead and open the Q&A session. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Matt. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the queue. You may press star two to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. Lisa, at your analyst day back in November, you seemed to kind of endorse the high $20 billion AI revenue expectation that was out there on the street for 2027. I know today you're reaffirming the path to strong double-digit growth. So I guess my question is, can you talk a little bit about what you've seen as far as customer engagements, how those might have expanded? I think you've alluded to in the past multiple multi-gigawatt opportunities. Just double-click on what you've seen for the MI455 and Helios platform from a demand-shaping perspective as we look into the back half of the year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So first of all, I think the MI450 series development is going extremely well. So we're very happy with the progress that we have. We're right on track for a second-half launch and beginning of production. And as it relates to sort of the shape of the ramp and the customer engagements, I would say the customer engagements continue to proceed very well. We have, obviously, a very strong relationship with OpenAI, and we're planning that ramp starting in the second half of the year, going into 2027. That is on track. We're also working closely with a number of other customers who are very interested in ramping MI450 quickly, just given the strength of the product. And we see that across both inference and training. And that is the opportunity that we see in front of us.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nSo we feel very good about sort of the data center growth overall for us in 2026. And then certainly, going into 2027, we've talked about $ tens of billions of data center AI revenue, and we feel very good about that.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nThanks a lot. Jean, I'm wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of detail under the hood for the March guidance. I know you basically told us that you told us about what embedded's going to be up a bit year over year. Client sounds like it's down seasonally, which I take to be maybe down 10. So can you give us a sense maybe of the other pieces? And then also, can you give us a sense of how data center GPU is going to ramp through the year? I know it's a back half loaded year, but I think people are thinking, Lisa, somewhere in the $14 billion range this year. That's what investors were thinking. I'm not asking you to endorse that.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nIf you can give us a little flavor for sort of how the ramp will look through the year, that'd be great. Thanks.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nHi, Tim. Thanks for your question. We're guiding one quarter at a time, but I can give you some color about our Q1 guide. First, it's right sequentially, we guided the decline around 5%, but data center is actually going to be up. And when you think about it, it's right. Our CPU business seasonal, actually, in a regular seasonal pattern, it's going to be down high single digit. And in our current guide, we actually guide CPU revenue up sequentially very nicely. Also, with the data center GPU side, we also feel really good about GPU revenue, including China, will be also up. So very nice guide for the data center overall. On the client side, we do see seasonality, sequentially decline. Embedded and gaming, they also have a seasonal decline.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAnd maybe, Tim, if I just give you a little bit on the full-year commentary. I think the important thing, as we look at the full year, we're very bullish on the year. We're not, if you look at the key themes, we're seeing very strong growth in the data center. And that's across two growth vectors. We see server CPU growth, actually, very strong. I mean, we've talked about the fact that CPUs are very important as AI continues to ramp. And we've seen the CPU order book continue to strengthen as we go through the last few quarters and especially over the last 60 days. So we see that as a strong growth driver for us. As Jean said, we see server CPU growing from Q4 into Q1 in what normally is seasonally down. And that continues throughout the year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThen on the data center AI side, it's a very important year for us. It's really an inflection point. MI355 has done well, and we were pleased with the performance in Q4. We continue to ramp that in the first half of the year. As we get into the second half of the year, the MI450 is really an inflection point for us. That revenue will start in the third quarter, but it will ramp significant volume in the fourth quarter as we get into 2027. That gives you a little bit of sort of what the data center ramp looks like throughout the year.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you, Lisa.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you. First, just clarification on what you're assuming for your China MI308 sales beyond Q1. And then, Lisa, specific to 2026, can your data center revenues grow at your target 60%+ growth rate? I realize that that's a multi-year target, but do you think that there are enough drivers, whether it's on the server CPU side or GPU side, for you to grow at that target base even in 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Sure, Vivek. So let me talk a little bit about China first because that's, I think, important for us to make sure that's clear. Look, we were pleased to have some MI308 sales in the fourth quarter. They were actually a license that was approved through work with the administration. And those orders were actually from very early in 2025. And so we saw some revenue in Q4, and we're forecasting for about $100 million of revenue in Q1. We are not forecasting any additional revenue from China just because it's a very dynamic situation. So given that it's a dynamic situation, we're still waiting. We've submitted licenses for the MI325, and we're continuing to work with customers and understanding sort of their customer demand. We thought it prudent not to forecast any additional revenue other than the $100 million that we called out in the Q1 guide.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nNow, as it relates to overall data center, as I mentioned in the question to Tim, we're very bullish about data center. I think the combination of drivers that we have across our CPU franchise, I mean, the EPYC product line, both Turin and Genoa, continue to ramp well. And in the second half of the year, we will be launching Venice, which we believe actually extends our leadership. And the MI450 ramp, which is also very significant in the second half of 2026. We're not, obviously, guiding specifically by segment, but the long-term target of, let's call it, greater than 60% is certainly possible in 2026.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you, Lisa.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor. Please proceed.\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Senior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious on the server CPU side of the house. And given the dramatic tightness, curious your ability to source incremental capacity from TSMC and elsewhere. And I guess how long will it take for that to see wafers out? And how should we think about the implications for kind of the growth trajectory throughout all of calendar 2026? And I guess as part of that, if you could speak to how we should be thinking about inflection in pricing as well, that would be very helpful.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nSure, CJ. So a couple of points about the server CPU market. First of all, we think the overall server CPU TAM is going to grow, let's call it, strong double digits in 2026, just given, as we said, the relationship between CPU demand and overall AI ramp. So I think that's a positive. Relative to our ability to support that, we've been seeing this trend for the last couple of quarters. So we have increased our supply capacity capability for server CPUs. And that's one of the reasons we're able to increase our Q1 guide as it relates to the server business. And we see the ability to continue to grow that throughout the year. There's no question that demand continues to be strong. And so we're working with our supply chain partners to increase supply as well.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFrom what we see today, I think the overall server situation is strong. We are increasing supply to address that.\n\n**Operator**\nHey, C.J. Do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Senior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nI do. Maybe for Jean, if you could kind of touch on gross margins through the year. And as you balance kind of strengthening server CPU with perhaps greater GPU accelerating in the second half, is there kind of a framework that we should be working off of? Thanks so much.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nYeah. Thank you for the question. We are very pleased with our gross margin Q4 performance and the Q1 guide at 55%, which actually is 130 basis points up year-over-year while we continue to ramp our MI355 year-over-year very significantly. I think we are benefiting from a very favorable product mix across all our business. If you think about it in data center, we're ramping our new product, new generation product, Turin, and the MI355, which helps the gross margin in client. We continue to move up the stack and also gaining momentum in our commercial business. Our client business gross margin has been improving nicely. In addition, certainly, we see the recovery of our embedded business, which is also margin accretive. So all those tailwinds we are seeing, we continue to see in the next few quarters.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nWhen MI450 ramp, of course, in Q4, our gross margin will be driven largely by mix. I think we'll give you more color when we get there. Overall, we feel really good about our gross margin progression this year.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors Research)\nGreat. Thank you. On the MI455 ramp, will 100% of the business be racks? Will there be kind of an eight-way server business around that architecture? And then is the revenue recognition when you ship to the rack vendor, or is there something to understand about that? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYes, Joe. So we do have multiple variants of the MI450 series, including an eight-way GPU form factor. But for 2026, I would say the vast majority of it is going to be rack-scale solutions. And yes, we will take revenue when we ship to the rack builder.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors Research)\nOkay. Great. And then can you talk to any risks that you may have in terms of once you get silicon out, turning that into racks, any potential issues as you ramp that? I know your competitor had some last year, and you said you learned from that. Is there anything you've done with kind of pre-building racks to sort of ensure you won't have those issues? Just any risk do we need to understand around that?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I mean, Joe, the main thing is the development's going really well. We're right on track with the MI450 series as well as the Helios rack development. We've done a lot of testing already, both at the rack-scale level as well as at the silicon level. So far, so good. We are getting, let's call it, a lot of input from our customers on things to test so that we can do a lot of testing in parallel. And our expectation is that we will be on track for our second-half launch.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, Lisa, I just wanted to ask about OpEx. Every quarter, you guys are guiding it up, and then it's coming in even higher, and then you're guiding it up again. And I understand, given the growth trajectory, that you need to invest. But how should we think about the ramp of that OpEx and that spending number, especially as the GPU revenue starts to inflect? Do we get leverage on that, or should we be expecting the OpEx to be growing even more materially as the AI revenue starts to ramp?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Sure, Stacy. Thanks for the question. Look, I think in terms of OpEx, we're at a point where we have very high conviction in the roadmap that we have. And so in 2025, as the revenue increased, we did lean in on OpEx. And I think it was for all the right reasons. As we get into 2026 and as we see some of the significant growth that we're expecting, we should absolutely see leverage. And the way to think about it is we've always said in our long-term model that OpEx should grow slower than revenue. And we would expect that in 2026 as well, especially as we get into the second half of the year and we see inflection in the revenue.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nBut at this point, I think if you look at our free cash flow generation and the overall revenue growth, I think the investment in OpEx is absolutely the right thing to do.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThank you. For my follow-up, I actually have two sort of one-line answers I'm looking for. Just first, the $100 million in China revenue in Q1, does that also drop through a zero-cost basis like we had in Q4, and is that a margin headwind? And number two, I know you don't give us the AI number, but could you just give us the annual 2025 Instinct number now that we're through the year? How big was it?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nStacy, let me answer your first question on the $100 million revenue in Q1. Actually, the inventory reserve reversed in Q4, which was $360 million, not only is associated with Q4 revenue, China revenue, but also covers the $100 million revenue we expect to ship in Q1 to China with our MI308. The Q1 gross margin guide is a very clean guide.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nStacy, for your second question, as you know, we don't guide at the business level. But to help you with your models, I think you can if you look at the Q4 data center AI number, even if you were to back out the China number, which was, let's call it, not a recurring number, you would still see growth. You'll see growth from Q3 to Q4. So that should help you a little bit with your modeling.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about clients. So the segment beat pretty handily in the fourth quarter. And I recognize you guys have been gaining share with Ryzen. But I think given what we've been seeing in the memory market, there's a lot of concern about inflationary costs and the potential for pull-ins. Were there any changes in your order patterns during the quarter? And maybe bigger picture, how are you thinking about client growth and the health of that market into 2026?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Josh. The client market has performed extremely well for us throughout 2025. Very strong growth for us, both in terms of ASP mixing up the stack as well as just unit growth. Going into 2026, we are certainly watching the development of the business. I think the PC market is an important market. Based on everything that we see today, we're probably seeing the PC TAM down a bit, just given some of the inflationary pressures of the commodities pricing, including memory. The way we are modeling the year is, let's call it, second half a bit subseasonal to first half, just given everything that we see. Even in that environment with the PC market down, we believe we can grow our PC business. Our focus areas are enterprise.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThat's a place where we're making very nice progress in 2025, and we expect that into 2026, and just continuing to grow sort of at the premium, higher end of the market.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you for the color there. Then I wanted to ask about the Instinct family. So we've seen your big GPU competitor make a deal with an SRAM-based spatial architecture provider. And then OpenAI has reportedly been linked to one as well. Could you speak to the competitive implications of that? You've done well in inferencing, I think, partly because of your leadership in HBM content. So I was wondering if you could maybe address the pull seemingly motivated by lower latency inference and how Instinct is positioned to service this if you're indeed seeing it as well. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I think, Josh, it's really, I think, the evolution that you might expect as the AI market matures. What we're seeing is, as inference ramps, really the tokens per dollar or the efficiency of the inference stack becomes more and more important. As you know, with our chiplet architecture, we have a lot of ability to optimize across inference, training, and even across sort of the different stages of inference as well. So I think I view this as very much as you go into the future, you'll see more workload-optimized products. And you can do that with GPUs as well as with other more ASIC-like architectures. I think we have the full compute stack to do all of those things.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFrom that standpoint, we're going to continue to lean into inference as we view that as a significant opportunity for us in addition to ramping our training capabilities.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Managing Director and Head of Technology Research)\nYeah. Hey. Thanks. Appreciate it. Hey, Lisa, I wanted to ask you about OpenAI. I'm sure a lot of the volatility out there is not lost on you. Is everything on track for the second half for starting the 6 GW and the three and a half year timeline as far as you know? And is there any other color that you'd just like to give on that relationship? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I mean, Ben, what I would say is we're very much working in partnership with OpenAI as well as our CSP partners to deliver on MI450 series and deliver on the ramp. The ramp is on schedule to start in the second half of the year. MI450 is doing great. Helios is doing well. We are in, let's call it, deep co-development across all of those parties. And as we look forward, I think we are optimistic about the MI450 ramp for OpenAI. But I also want to remind everyone that we have a broad set of customers that are very excited about MI450 series. And so in addition to the work that we're doing with OpenAI, there are a number of customers that we're working to ramp in that timeframe as well.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Managing Director and Head of Technology Research)\nAll right. I appreciate that. I wanted to shift to the server CPU and just talk about x86 versus ARM. There's some view out there that x86 has particular edge in agents, big picture. Do you agree with that? And what are you seeing from customers? And in particular, obviously, your big competitor is going to be selling an ARM CPU separately now in the second half. So if there's just anything on that competitive dynamic versus ARM and what NVIDIA is doing and your views on that, that'd be great to hear. Thanks.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Ben, what I would say about the CPU market is there is a great need for high-performance CPUs right now. And that goes towards agentic workloads where when you have these AI processes or AI agents that are spinning off a lot of work in an enterprise, they're actually going to a lot of traditional CPU tasks. And the vast majority of them are on x86 today. I think the beauty of EPYC is that we've optimized. We've done workload optimization. So we have the best cloud processor out there. We have the best enterprise processor. We also have some lower-cost variants for storage and other elements. And I think all of that comes into play as we think about the entirety of the AI infrastructure that needs to be put in place.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nI think the CPUs are going to continue to be as important as a piece of the AI infrastructure ramp. That's one of the things that we mentioned at our Analyst Day back in November, really this multi-year CPU cycle. We continue to see that. I think we've optimized EPYC to satisfy all of those workloads. We're going to continue to work with our customers to expand our EPYC footprint.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, Lisa. How are you? I just wanted to ask, you mentioned on memory earlier as a sticking point in terms of inflationary cost. Different customers do this in different ways. Different suppliers do this in different ways. But could you maybe talk about your procurement of memory, when that takes place, particularly on the HBM side? Is that something that gets done a year in advance, six months in advance? Different accelerator guys have talked about different timelines. We'd be curious to kind of hear when you do the procurement.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I mean, given the lead times for things like HBM and wafers and these parts of the supply chain, I mean, we're working closely with our suppliers over a multi-year timeframe in terms of what we see in demand, how we ramp, how we ensure that our development is very closely tied together. So I feel very good about our supply chain capabilities. We have been planning for this ramp. So independent of the current market conditions, we've been planning for a significant ramp in both CPU as well as our GPU business over the past couple of years. And so from that standpoint, I think we're well-positioned to grow substantially in 2026. And now we're also doing multi-year agreements that extend beyond that given tightness of the supply chain.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks. And just as a follow-up, you've seen a variety of different things in the industry in terms of system accelerator, so KV cache offload, more discrete ASIC-style compute, CPX. If you look at what your competitors are doing and you look at your first generation of system architecture coming out, maybe spend some time on, do you see yourself following in the footsteps of some of these different types of architectural changes? Do you think that you'll go in a different direction? Anything just on the evolution of your system-based architecture and then the adjoining products and/or silicon within. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nI think, Tom, what we have is the ability with a very flexible architecture with our chiplet architecture. And then we also have a flexible platform architecture that allows us to really have different system solutions for the different requirements. I think we're very cognizant that there will be different solutions. So there's no—I've often said there's no one-size-fits-all. And I'll say that again. There's no one-size-fits-all. But that being the case, it's clear that the rack scale architecture is very, very good for the highest-end applications when you're talking about distributed inference and training. But we also see an opportunity with enterprise AI to use some of these other form factors. And so we're investing across that spectrum.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHi. Thanks for my last couple of questions. I guess my first question is back on the gross margin side of things. As you go from the MI300 to the 400 to the 500 eventually, do you see any changes in the gross margin throughout that period? In the past, you've talked about optimizing dollars more so than percentages. But just on the percentage side, does it go up, down? Is there volatility as you go from one to the next for any reason? Just wondered on the trajectory there.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nRoss, thank you for the question. At a very high level, each generation, we actually provide much more capabilities, more memory, help our customer more. So in general, the gross margin should progress each generation when you offer more capabilities to your customers. But typically, when you first ramp at the beginning of ramp of a generation, it tends to be lower. When you get to the scale, get to the yield improvement, the test improvement, and also overall performance improvement, you will see gross margin improving within each generation. So it's kind of a dynamic gross margin. But in the longer term, you should expect each generation should have a higher gross margin.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks for that, Jean. Then one small segment of your business, but it seems quite volatile. You talked a little bit about further off than you usually do, is the gaming side of things. What is the magnitude down you're talking about this year? Because in 2025, you thought it was going to be flat. And it ended up growing 50%, which was a nice positive surprise. But now that you're talking about this year being down, but then the next-gen Xbox ramping in 2027, I just hope to get some color on what you see as kind of the annual trajectory there.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nYeah. So Lisa can add more. So 2026, actually, it's the seventh year of a current product cycle. Typically, when you're at this stage of the cycle, revenue tends to come down. We do expect the revenue on the semi-customer revenue side to come down significantly, double-digit for 2026, as Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks. For the next generation?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Yeah. I think we'll certainly talk about that going forward. But as we ramp the new generation, you would expect a reversal of that.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (VP of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations)\nOperator, I think we have time for one more caller on the call, please. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOur final question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Relative to the ramp of your rack-scale systems, would you expect any kind of bottleneck in terms of supply constraints in terms of the ramp as you ramp the second half of the year to potentially impact or limit the revenue growth? In other words, maybe talk about whether you expect supply to really kind of meet the growth in Q4 sequentially relative to sorry, Q3 relative to Q4.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Jim, we are planning this at every component level. So I think relative to our data center AI ramp, I do not believe that we will be supply-limited in terms of the ramp that we put in place. I think we have an aggressive ramp. I think it's a very doable ramp. And as we think about the size and scale of AMD, clearly, our priority is ensuring that the data center ramps go very well. And that's both on the data center AI, the GPU side, as well as on the CPU side.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you. And then maybe as a follow-up to the earlier question on OPEX, could you maybe address what are some of the largest investment areas you made in 2025? And then what are the largest incremental OPEX investment areas for 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, Jim. On the 2025 investment, the priority and the largest investment in data center AI, our hardware roadmap, we accelerated that roadmap. We expand our software capabilities. We also acquired ZT Systems, which add significant system-level solutions and capabilities. Those are the primary investment in 2025. We also invest heavily in go-to-market to really expand our go-to-market capabilities to support revenue growth and also expand our commercial business and enterprise business for our CPU franchise. In 2026, you should expect us to continue to invest aggressively. But as Lisa mentioned earlier, we do expect revenue to expand faster than operating expense increase to drive the earnings per share expansion.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nAll right. Thank you, everybody, for participating on the call. Operator, I think we can go ahead and close the call now. Thank you. Good evening.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question-and-answer session. That also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a great rest of the day.",

This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (VP of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations)\nBefore we begin, I would like to note that Mark Papermaster, Executive Vice President and CTO, will present at Morgan Stanley's TMT conference on Tuesday, March 3rd. Today's discussions contain forward-looking statements based on our current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations, speak only as of today, and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I will hand the call to Lisa.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. 2025 was a defining year for AMD, with record revenue, net income, and free cash flow driven by broad-based demand for high-performance computing and AI products. We ended the year with significant momentum, with every part of our business performing very well. We saw demand accelerate across the data center, PC, gaming, and embedded markets, launched the broadest set of leadership products in our history, gained significant server and PC processor share, and rapidly scaled our data center AI business as Instinct and ROCm adoption increased with cloud, enterprise, and AI customers. Looking at our fourth quarter, fourth quarter revenue grew 34% year-over-year to $10.3 billion, led by record EPYC, Ryzen, and Instinct processor sales.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nNet income increased 42% to a record $2.5 billion, and free cash flow nearly doubled year-over-year to a record $2.1 billion. For the full year, revenue grew 34% to $34.6 billion, and we added more than $7.6 billion of data center segment and client revenue. Turning to our fourth quarter segment results, data center segment revenue increased 39% year-over-year to a record $5.4 billion, led by accelerating Instinct MI350 series GPU deployments and server share gains. In server, adoption of 5th-gen EPYC Turin CPUs accelerated in the quarter, accounting for more than half of the total server revenue. 4th-gen EPYC sales were also robust, as our prior generation CPUs continued to deliver superior performance and TCO compared to competitive offerings across a wide range of workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs a result, we had record server CPU sales to both cloud and enterprise customers in the quarter and exited the year with record share. In cloud, hyperscaler demand was very strong as North American customers expanded deployments. EPYC-powered public cloud offerings grew significantly in the quarter, with AWS, Google, and others launching more than 230 new AMD instances. Hyperscalers launched more than 500 AMD-based instances in 2025, increasing the number of EPYC cloud instances more than 50% year over year to nearly 1,600. In the enterprise, we are seeing a meaningful shift in EPYC adoption driven by our leadership performance, expanded platform availability, broad software enablement, and increased go-to-market programs. The leading server providers now offer more than 3,000 solutions powered by fourth- and fifth-gen EPYC CPUs that are optimized for all major enterprise workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs a result, the number of large businesses deploying EPYC on-prem more than doubled in 2025, and we exited the year with record server sell-through. Looking ahead, server CPU demand remains very strong. Hyperscalers are expanding their infrastructure to meet growing demand for cloud services and AI, while enterprises are modernizing their data centers to ensure they have the right compute required to enable new AI workflows. Against this backdrop, EPYC has become the processor of choice for the modern data center, delivering leadership performance, efficiency, and TCO. Our next-generation Venice CPU extends our leadership across each of these metrics. Customer pull for Venice is very high, with engagements underway to support large-scale cloud deployments and broad OEM platform availability when Venice launches later this year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nTurning to our data center AI business, we delivered record Instinct GPU revenue in the fourth quarter, led by the ramp of MI350 series shipments. We also had some revenue from MI308 sales to customers in China. Instinct adoption broadened in the quarter. Today, 8 of the top 10 AI companies use Instinct to power production workloads across a growing range of use cases. With the MI350 series, we are entering the next phase of Instinct adoption, expanding our footprint with existing partners and adding new customers. In the fourth quarter, hyperscalers expanded MI350 series availability, leading AI companies scale their deployments to support additional workloads, and multiple neocloud providers launched MI350 series offerings that deliver on-demand access to Instinct infrastructure in the cloud.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nTurning to our AI software stack, we expanded the ROCm ecosystem in the fourth quarter, enabling customers to deploy Instinct faster and with higher performance across a broader range of workloads. Millions of large language and multimodal models run out of the box on AMD, with the leading models launching with day zero support for Instinct GPUs. This capability highlights our rapidly expanding open-source community enablement, including new upstream integration of AMD GPUs in vLLM, one of the most widely used inference engines. To drive Instinct adoption with industry-specific use cases, we're also adding support for domain-specific models in key verticals. As one example, in healthcare, we added ROCm support for the leading medical imaging framework to enable developers to train and deploy highly performant deep learning models on Instinct GPUs.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFor large businesses, we introduced our Enterprise AI Suite, a full-stack software platform with enterprise-grade tools, inference microservices, and solutions blueprints designed to simplify and accelerate production deployments at scale. We also announced a strategic partnership with Tata Consultancy Services to co-develop industry-specific AI solutions and help customers deploy AI across their operations. Looking ahead, customer engagements for our next-gen MI400 series and Helios platform continue expanding. In addition to our multi-generation partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 GW of Instinct GPUs, we are in active discussions with other customers on at-scale multi-year deployments starting with Helios and MI450 later this year. With the MI400 series, we are also expanding our portfolio to address the full range of cloud, HPC, and enterprise AI workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThis includes MI455X and Helios for AI superclusters, MI430X for HPC and sovereign AI, and MI440X servers for enterprise customers requiring leadership training and inference performance in a compact 8-GPU solution that integrates easily into existing infrastructure. Multiple OEMs publicly announced plans to launch Helios systems in 2026, with deep engineering engagement underway to support smooth production ramps. In December, HPE announced that they will offer Helios racks with purpose-built HPE Juniper Ethernet switches and optimized software for high-bandwidth scale-up networking. And in January, Lenovo announced plans to offer Helios racks. MI430X adoption also grew in the quarter, with new Exascale-class supercomputers announced by GENCI in France and HLRS in Germany. Looking further ahead, development of our next-generation MI500 series is well underway. MI500 is powered by our CDNA six architecture, built on advanced 2-nanometer process technology, and features high-speed HBM4e memory.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe are on track to launch MI500 in 2027 and expect MI500 to deliver another major leap in AI performance to power the next wave of large-scale multimodal models. In summary, our AI business is accelerating, with the launch of MI400 series and Helios representing a major inflection point for the business as we deliver leadership performance and TCO at the chip, compute tray, and rack level. Based on the strength of our EPYC and Instinct roadmaps, we are well positioned to grow data center segment revenue by more than 60% annually over the next three to five years and scale our AI business to tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027. Turning to client and gaming, segment revenue increased 37% year-over-year to $3.9 billion. In client, our PC processor business performed exceptionally well.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nRevenue increased 34% year-over-year to a record $3.1 billion, driven by increased demand for multiple generations of Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs. Desktop CPU sales set a record for the fourth consecutive quarter. Ryzen CPUs topped the bestseller lists at major global retailers and e-tailers throughout the holiday period, with strong demand across all price points in every region driving record desktop channel sellout. In mobile, strong demand for AMD-powered notebooks drove record Ryzen PC sell-through in the quarter. That momentum extended into commercial PCs, where Ryzen adoption accelerated as we established a new long-term growth engine for our client business. Sell-through of Ryzen CPUs for commercial notebooks and desktops grew by more than 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and we closed large wins with major telecom, financial services, aerospace, automotive, energy, and technology customers.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAt CES, we expanded our Ryzen portfolio with CPUs that further extend our performance leadership. Our new Ryzen AI 400 mobile processors deliver significantly faster content creation and multitasking performance than the competition. Notebooks powered by Ryzen AI 400 are already available, with the broadest lineup of AMD-based consumer and commercial AI PCs set to launch throughout the year. We also introduced our Ryzen AI Halo platform, the world's smallest AI development system, featuring our highest-end Ryzen AI Max processor with 128 GB of unified memory that can run models with up to 200 billion parameters locally. In gaming, revenue increased 50% year-over-year to $843 million. Semi-custom sales increased year-over-year and declined sequentially, as expected. For 2026, we expect semi-custom SoC annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage as we enter the seventh year of what has been a very strong console cycle.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFrom a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year, and development of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027. Gaming GPU revenue also increased year-over-year, with higher channel sellout driven by demand throughout the holiday sales period for our latest generation Radeon RX 9000 Series GPUs. We also launched FSR 4 Redstone in the quarter, our most advanced AI-powered upscaling technology, delivering higher image quality and smoother frame rates for gamers. Turning to our embedded segment, revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $950 million, led by strength with test and measurement and aerospace customers and growing adoption of our embedded x86 CPUs. Channel sell-through accelerated in the quarter as end-customer demand improved across several end markets, led by test, measurement, and emulation.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nDesign win momentum remains one of the clearest indicators of long-term growth for our embedded business, and we delivered another record year. We closed $17 billion in design wins in 2025, up nearly 20% year-over-year, as we've now won more than $50 billion of embedded designs since acquiring Xilinx. We also strengthened our embedded portfolio in the quarter. We began production of our Versal AI Edge Gen 2 SoCs for low-latency inference workloads and started shipping our highest-end Spartan UltraScale+ devices for cost-optimized applications. We also launched new embedded CPUs, including our EPYC 2005 Series for network security and industrial edge applications, Ryzen P100 Series for in-vehicle infotainment and industrial systems, and Ryzen X100 Series for physical AI and autonomous platforms. In summary, 2025 was an excellent year for AMD, marking the start of a new growth trajectory for the company.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe are entering a multi-year demand supercycle for high performance and AI computing that is creating significant growth opportunities across each of our businesses. AMD is well positioned to capture that growth, with highly differentiated products, a proven execution engine, deep customer partnerships, and significant operational scale. As AI reshapes the compute landscape, we have the breadth of solutions and partnerships required for end-to-end leadership, from Helios in the cloud for at-scale training and inference to an expanded Instinct portfolio for sovereign supercomputing and enterprise AI deployment. At the same time, demand for EPYC CPUs is surging as agentic and emerging AI workloads require high-performance CPUs to power head nodes and run parallel tasks alongside GPUs. At the edge and in PCs where AI adoption is just beginning, our industry-leading Ryzen and embedded processors are powering real-time on-device AI.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs a result, we expect significant top-line and bottom-line growth in 2026, led by increased adoption of EPYC and Instinct, continued client share gains, and a return to growth in our embedded segment. Looking further ahead, we see a clear path to achieve the ambitious targets we laid out at our financial analyst day last November, including growing revenue at greater than 35% CAGR over the next three to five years, significantly expanding operating margins, and generating annual EPS of more than $20 in the strategic time frame, driven by growth in all of our segments and the rapid scaling of our data center AI business. Now I'll turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our fourth quarter results and full-year results. Jean?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. AMD executed very well in 2025, delivering record revenue of $34.6 billion, up 34% year-over-year, driven by 32% growth in our data center segment and 51% growth in our client and gaming segment. Gross margin was 52%, and we delivered record earnings per share of $4.17, up 26% year-over-year while continuing to invest aggressively in AI and the data center to support our long-term growth. For the fourth quarter of 2025, revenue was a record $10.3 billion, growing 34% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in the data center and client gaming segments, including approximately $390 million in revenue from MI308 sales to China, which was not included in our fourth quarter guidance.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nRevenue was up 11% sequentially, primarily driven by continued strong growth in data center from both server and data center AI businesses, as well as a return to year-over-year growth in the embedded segment. Gross margin was 57%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. We benefited from the release of $360 million in previously written-down MI308 inventory reserves. Excluding the inventory reserve release and the MI308 revenue from China, gross margin would have been approximately 55%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by favorable product mix. Operating expenses were $3 billion, an increase of 42% year-over-year as we continue to invest in R&D go-to-market activities to support our AI roadmap and long-term growth opportunities, as well as higher employee performance-based incentives.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nOperating income was a record $2.9 billion, representing a 28% operating margin, tax increase, and other, resulting in a net expense of approximately $335 million. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was a record $1.53, an increase of 40% year-over-year, reflecting strong execution and operating leverage in our business model. Now turning to our reportable segment. Starting with the data center segment, revenue was a record $5.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year and 24% sequentially, driven by strong demand for EPYC processors and the continued ramp of MI350 products. Data center segment operating income was $1.8 billion, or 33% of revenue, compared to $1.2 billion, or 30% a year ago, reflecting higher revenue and the inventory reserve release, partially offset by continued investment to support our AI hardware and software roadmaps.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nClient gaming segment revenue was $3.9 billion, up 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong demand for our leadership AMD Ryzen processors. On a sequential basis, revenue was down 3% due to lower semi-customer revenue. The client business revenue was a record $3.1 billion, up 34% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, led by strong demand from both the channel and the PC OEMs and continued market share gains. The gaming business revenue was $843 million, up 50% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher semi-customer revenue and strong demand for AMD Radeon GPUs. Sequentially, gaming revenue was down 35% due to lower semi-customer sales. Client gaming segment operating income was $725 million, or 18% of revenue, compared to $496 million, or 17% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $950 million, up 3% year-over-year and 11% sequentially as demand strengthened across several end markets.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nEmbedded segment operating income was $357 million, or 38% of revenue, compared to $362 million, or 39% a year ago. Before I reveal the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the sale of ZT Systems manufacturing business to Sanmina in late October. The fourth quarter financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statement as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated a record $2.3 billion in cash from continuing operations and a record of $2.1 billion in free cash flow. Inventory increased sequentially by approximately $607 million-$7.9 billion to support strong data center demand. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment were $10.6 billion.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nFor the year, we repurchased 12.4 million shares and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders. We ended the year with $9.4 billion authorization remaining and our share repurchase program. Now turning to our first quarter 2026 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $9.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, including approximately $100 million of MI308 sales to China. At the middle point of our guidance, revenue is expected to be up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our data center and client gaming segments and modest growth in our embedded segment. Sequentially, we expect revenue to be down approximately 5%, driven by seasonal decline in our client gaming and embedded segment, partially offset by growth in our data center segment.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nIn addition, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 55%, non-GAAP operating expense to be approximately $3.05 billion, non-GAAP other net income to be approximately $35 million, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.65 billion shares. In closing, 2025 was an outstanding year for AMD, reflecting disciplined execution across the business to deliver strong revenue growth, increase profitability, and cash generation while investing aggressively in AI and innovation to support our long-term growth strategy. Looking ahead, we are very well positioned for continued strong top-line revenue growth and earnings expansion in 2026 with a focus on driving data center AI growth, operating leverage, and delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (VP of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations)\nYes. Thank you very much, Jean. Operator, please go ahead and open the Q&A session. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Matt. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the queue. You may press star two to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. Lisa, at your analyst day back in November, you seemed to kind of endorse the high $20 billion AI revenue expectation that was out there on the street for 2027. I know today you're reaffirming the path to strong double-digit growth. So I guess my question is, can you talk a little bit about what you've seen as far as customer engagements, how those might have expanded? I think you've alluded to in the past multiple multi-gigawatt opportunities. Just double-click on what you've seen for the MI455 and Helios platform from a demand-shaping perspective as we look into the back half of the year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So first of all, I think the MI450 series development is going extremely well. So we're very happy with the progress that we have. We're right on track for a second-half launch and beginning of production. And as it relates to sort of the shape of the ramp and the customer engagements, I would say the customer engagements continue to proceed very well. We have, obviously, a very strong relationship with OpenAI, and we're planning that ramp starting in the second half of the year, going into 2027. That is on track. We're also working closely with a number of other customers who are very interested in ramping MI450 quickly, just given the strength of the product. And we see that across both inference and training. And that is the opportunity that we see in front of us.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nSo we feel very good about sort of the data center growth overall for us in 2026. And then certainly, going into 2027, we've talked about $ tens of billions of data center AI revenue, and we feel very good about that.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nThanks a lot. Jean, I'm wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of detail under the hood for the March guidance. I know you basically told us that you told us about what embedded's going to be up a bit year over year. Client sounds like it's down seasonally, which I take to be maybe down 10. So can you give us a sense maybe of the other pieces? And then also, can you give us a sense of how data center GPU is going to ramp through the year? I know it's a back half loaded year, but I think people are thinking, Lisa, somewhere in the $14 billion range this year. That's what investors were thinking. I'm not asking you to endorse that.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nIf you can give us a little flavor for sort of how the ramp will look through the year, that'd be great. Thanks.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nHi, Tim. Thanks for your question. We're guiding one quarter at a time, but I can give you some color about our Q1 guide. First, it's right sequentially, we guided the decline around 5%, but data center is actually going to be up. And when you think about it, it's right. Our CPU business seasonal, actually, in a regular seasonal pattern, it's going to be down high single digit. And in our current guide, we actually guide CPU revenue up sequentially very nicely. Also, with the data center GPU side, we also feel really good about GPU revenue, including China, will be also up. So very nice guide for the data center overall. On the client side, we do see seasonality, sequentially decline. Embedded and gaming, they also have a seasonal decline.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nAnd maybe, Tim, if I just give you a little bit on the full-year commentary. I think the important thing, as we look at the full year, we're very bullish on the year. We're not, if you look at the key themes, we're seeing very strong growth in the data center. And that's across two growth vectors. We see server CPU growth, actually, very strong. I mean, we've talked about the fact that CPUs are very important as AI continues to ramp. And we've seen the CPU order book continue to strengthen as we go through the last few quarters and especially over the last 60 days. So we see that as a strong growth driver for us. As Jean said, we see server CPU growing from Q4 into Q1 in what normally is seasonally down. And that continues throughout the year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThen on the data center AI side, it's a very important year for us. It's really an inflection point. MI355 has done well, and we were pleased with the performance in Q4. We continue to ramp that in the first half of the year. As we get into the second half of the year, the MI450 is really an inflection point for us. That revenue will start in the third quarter, but it will ramp significant volume in the fourth quarter as we get into 2027. That gives you a little bit of sort of what the data center ramp looks like throughout the year.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you, Lisa.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you. First, just clarification on what you're assuming for your China MI308 sales beyond Q1. And then, Lisa, specific to 2026, can your data center revenues grow at your target 60%+ growth rate? I realize that that's a multi-year target, but do you think that there are enough drivers, whether it's on the server CPU side or GPU side, for you to grow at that target base even in 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Sure, Vivek. So let me talk a little bit about China first because that's, I think, important for us to make sure that's clear. Look, we were pleased to have some MI308 sales in the fourth quarter. They were actually a license that was approved through work with the administration. And those orders were actually from very early in 2025. And so we saw some revenue in Q4, and we're forecasting for about $100 million of revenue in Q1. We are not forecasting any additional revenue from China just because it's a very dynamic situation. So given that it's a dynamic situation, we're still waiting. We've submitted licenses for the MI325, and we're continuing to work with customers and understanding sort of their customer demand. We thought it prudent not to forecast any additional revenue other than the $100 million that we called out in the Q1 guide.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nNow, as it relates to overall data center, as I mentioned in the question to Tim, we're very bullish about data center. I think the combination of drivers that we have across our CPU franchise, I mean, the EPYC product line, both Turin and Genoa, continue to ramp well. And in the second half of the year, we will be launching Venice, which we believe actually extends our leadership. And the MI450 ramp, which is also very significant in the second half of 2026. We're not, obviously, guiding specifically by segment, but the long-term target of, let's call it, greater than 60% is certainly possible in 2026.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you, Lisa.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor. Please proceed.\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Senior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious on the server CPU side of the house. And given the dramatic tightness, curious your ability to source incremental capacity from TSMC and elsewhere. And I guess how long will it take for that to see wafers out? And how should we think about the implications for kind of the growth trajectory throughout all of calendar 2026? And I guess as part of that, if you could speak to how we should be thinking about inflection in pricing as well, that would be very helpful.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nSure, CJ. So a couple of points about the server CPU market. First of all, we think the overall server CPU TAM is going to grow, let's call it, strong double digits in 2026, just given, as we said, the relationship between CPU demand and overall AI ramp. So I think that's a positive. Relative to our ability to support that, we've been seeing this trend for the last couple of quarters. So we have increased our supply capacity capability for server CPUs. And that's one of the reasons we're able to increase our Q1 guide as it relates to the server business. And we see the ability to continue to grow that throughout the year. There's no question that demand continues to be strong. And so we're working with our supply chain partners to increase supply as well.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFrom what we see today, I think the overall server situation is strong. We are increasing supply to address that.\n\n**Operator**\nHey, C.J. Do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Senior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nI do. Maybe for Jean, if you could kind of touch on gross margins through the year. And as you balance kind of strengthening server CPU with perhaps greater GPU accelerating in the second half, is there kind of a framework that we should be working off of? Thanks so much.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nYeah. Thank you for the question. We are very pleased with our gross margin Q4 performance and the Q1 guide at 55%, which actually is 130 basis points up year-over-year while we continue to ramp our MI355 year-over-year very significantly. I think we are benefiting from a very favorable product mix across all our business. If you think about it in data center, we're ramping our new product, new generation product, Turin, and the MI355, which helps the gross margin in client. We continue to move up the stack and also gaining momentum in our commercial business. Our client business gross margin has been improving nicely. In addition, certainly, we see the recovery of our embedded business, which is also margin accretive. So all those tailwinds we are seeing, we continue to see in the next few quarters.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nWhen MI450 ramp, of course, in Q4, our gross margin will be driven largely by mix. I think we'll give you more color when we get there. Overall, we feel really good about our gross margin progression this year.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors Research)\nGreat. Thank you. On the MI455 ramp, will 100% of the business be racks? Will there be kind of an eight-way server business around that architecture? And then is the revenue recognition when you ship to the rack vendor, or is there something to understand about that? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYes, Joe. So we do have multiple variants of the MI450 series, including an eight-way GPU form factor. But for 2026, I would say the vast majority of it is going to be rack-scale solutions. And yes, we will take revenue when we ship to the rack builder.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director and Head of U.S. Semiconductors Research)\nOkay. Great. And then can you talk to any risks that you may have in terms of once you get silicon out, turning that into racks, any potential issues as you ramp that? I know your competitor had some last year, and you said you learned from that. Is there anything you've done with kind of pre-building racks to sort of ensure you won't have those issues? Just any risk do we need to understand around that?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I mean, Joe, the main thing is the development's going really well. We're right on track with the MI450 series as well as the Helios rack development. We've done a lot of testing already, both at the rack-scale level as well as at the silicon level. So far, so good. We are getting, let's call it, a lot of input from our customers on things to test so that we can do a lot of testing in parallel. And our expectation is that we will be on track for our second-half launch.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, Lisa, I just wanted to ask about OpEx. Every quarter, you guys are guiding it up, and then it's coming in even higher, and then you're guiding it up again. And I understand, given the growth trajectory, that you need to invest. But how should we think about the ramp of that OpEx and that spending number, especially as the GPU revenue starts to inflect? Do we get leverage on that, or should we be expecting the OpEx to be growing even more materially as the AI revenue starts to ramp?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Sure, Stacy. Thanks for the question. Look, I think in terms of OpEx, we're at a point where we have very high conviction in the roadmap that we have. And so in 2025, as the revenue increased, we did lean in on OpEx. And I think it was for all the right reasons. As we get into 2026 and as we see some of the significant growth that we're expecting, we should absolutely see leverage. And the way to think about it is we've always said in our long-term model that OpEx should grow slower than revenue. And we would expect that in 2026 as well, especially as we get into the second half of the year and we see inflection in the revenue.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nBut at this point, I think if you look at our free cash flow generation and the overall revenue growth, I think the investment in OpEx is absolutely the right thing to do.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThank you. For my follow-up, I actually have two sort of one-line answers I'm looking for. Just first, the $100 million in China revenue in Q1, does that also drop through a zero-cost basis like we had in Q4, and is that a margin headwind? And number two, I know you don't give us the AI number, but could you just give us the annual 2025 Instinct number now that we're through the year? How big was it?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nStacy, let me answer your first question on the $100 million revenue in Q1. Actually, the inventory reserve reversed in Q4, which was $360 million, not only is associated with Q4 revenue, China revenue, but also covers the $100 million revenue we expect to ship in Q1 to China with our MI308. The Q1 gross margin guide is a very clean guide.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nStacy, for your second question, as you know, we don't guide at the business level. But to help you with your models, I think you can if you look at the Q4 data center AI number, even if you were to back out the China number, which was, let's call it, not a recurring number, you would still see growth. You'll see growth from Q3 to Q4. So that should help you a little bit with your modeling.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about clients. So the segment beat pretty handily in the fourth quarter. And I recognize you guys have been gaining share with Ryzen. But I think given what we've been seeing in the memory market, there's a lot of concern about inflationary costs and the potential for pull-ins. Were there any changes in your order patterns during the quarter? And maybe bigger picture, how are you thinking about client growth and the health of that market into 2026?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Josh. The client market has performed extremely well for us throughout 2025. Very strong growth for us, both in terms of ASP mixing up the stack as well as just unit growth. Going into 2026, we are certainly watching the development of the business. I think the PC market is an important market. Based on everything that we see today, we're probably seeing the PC TAM down a bit, just given some of the inflationary pressures of the commodities pricing, including memory. The way we are modeling the year is, let's call it, second half a bit subseasonal to first half, just given everything that we see. Even in that environment with the PC market down, we believe we can grow our PC business. Our focus areas are enterprise.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nThat's a place where we're making very nice progress in 2025, and we expect that into 2026, and just continuing to grow sort of at the premium, higher end of the market.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you for the color there. Then I wanted to ask about the Instinct family. So we've seen your big GPU competitor make a deal with an SRAM-based spatial architecture provider. And then OpenAI has reportedly been linked to one as well. Could you speak to the competitive implications of that? You've done well in inferencing, I think, partly because of your leadership in HBM content. So I was wondering if you could maybe address the pull seemingly motivated by lower latency inference and how Instinct is positioned to service this if you're indeed seeing it as well. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I think, Josh, it's really, I think, the evolution that you might expect as the AI market matures. What we're seeing is, as inference ramps, really the tokens per dollar or the efficiency of the inference stack becomes more and more important. As you know, with our chiplet architecture, we have a lot of ability to optimize across inference, training, and even across sort of the different stages of inference as well. So I think I view this as very much as you go into the future, you'll see more workload-optimized products. And you can do that with GPUs as well as with other more ASIC-like architectures. I think we have the full compute stack to do all of those things.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nFrom that standpoint, we're going to continue to lean into inference as we view that as a significant opportunity for us in addition to ramping our training capabilities.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Managing Director and Head of Technology Research)\nYeah. Hey. Thanks. Appreciate it. Hey, Lisa, I wanted to ask you about OpenAI. I'm sure a lot of the volatility out there is not lost on you. Is everything on track for the second half for starting the 6 GW and the three and a half year timeline as far as you know? And is there any other color that you'd just like to give on that relationship? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I mean, Ben, what I would say is we're very much working in partnership with OpenAI as well as our CSP partners to deliver on MI450 series and deliver on the ramp. The ramp is on schedule to start in the second half of the year. MI450 is doing great. Helios is doing well. We are in, let's call it, deep co-development across all of those parties. And as we look forward, I think we are optimistic about the MI450 ramp for OpenAI. But I also want to remind everyone that we have a broad set of customers that are very excited about MI450 series. And so in addition to the work that we're doing with OpenAI, there are a number of customers that we're working to ramp in that timeframe as well.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Managing Director and Head of Technology Research)\nAll right. I appreciate that. I wanted to shift to the server CPU and just talk about x86 versus ARM. There's some view out there that x86 has particular edge in agents, big picture. Do you agree with that? And what are you seeing from customers? And in particular, obviously, your big competitor is going to be selling an ARM CPU separately now in the second half. So if there's just anything on that competitive dynamic versus ARM and what NVIDIA is doing and your views on that, that'd be great to hear. Thanks.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Ben, what I would say about the CPU market is there is a great need for high-performance CPUs right now. And that goes towards agentic workloads where when you have these AI processes or AI agents that are spinning off a lot of work in an enterprise, they're actually going to a lot of traditional CPU tasks. And the vast majority of them are on x86 today. I think the beauty of EPYC is that we've optimized. We've done workload optimization. So we have the best cloud processor out there. We have the best enterprise processor. We also have some lower-cost variants for storage and other elements. And I think all of that comes into play as we think about the entirety of the AI infrastructure that needs to be put in place.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nI think the CPUs are going to continue to be as important as a piece of the AI infrastructure ramp. That's one of the things that we mentioned at our Analyst Day back in November, really this multi-year CPU cycle. We continue to see that. I think we've optimized EPYC to satisfy all of those workloads. We're going to continue to work with our customers to expand our EPYC footprint.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, Lisa. How are you? I just wanted to ask, you mentioned on memory earlier as a sticking point in terms of inflationary cost. Different customers do this in different ways. Different suppliers do this in different ways. But could you maybe talk about your procurement of memory, when that takes place, particularly on the HBM side? Is that something that gets done a year in advance, six months in advance? Different accelerator guys have talked about different timelines. We'd be curious to kind of hear when you do the procurement.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. I mean, given the lead times for things like HBM and wafers and these parts of the supply chain, I mean, we're working closely with our suppliers over a multi-year timeframe in terms of what we see in demand, how we ramp, how we ensure that our development is very closely tied together. So I feel very good about our supply chain capabilities. We have been planning for this ramp. So independent of the current market conditions, we've been planning for a significant ramp in both CPU as well as our GPU business over the past couple of years. And so from that standpoint, I think we're well-positioned to grow substantially in 2026. And now we're also doing multi-year agreements that extend beyond that given tightness of the supply chain.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks. And just as a follow-up, you've seen a variety of different things in the industry in terms of system accelerator, so KV cache offload, more discrete ASIC-style compute, CPX. If you look at what your competitors are doing and you look at your first generation of system architecture coming out, maybe spend some time on, do you see yourself following in the footsteps of some of these different types of architectural changes? Do you think that you'll go in a different direction? Anything just on the evolution of your system-based architecture and then the adjoining products and/or silicon within. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nI think, Tom, what we have is the ability with a very flexible architecture with our chiplet architecture. And then we also have a flexible platform architecture that allows us to really have different system solutions for the different requirements. I think we're very cognizant that there will be different solutions. So there's no—I've often said there's no one-size-fits-all. And I'll say that again. There's no one-size-fits-all. But that being the case, it's clear that the rack scale architecture is very, very good for the highest-end applications when you're talking about distributed inference and training. But we also see an opportunity with enterprise AI to use some of these other form factors. And so we're investing across that spectrum.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHi. Thanks for my last couple of questions. I guess my first question is back on the gross margin side of things. As you go from the MI300 to the 400 to the 500 eventually, do you see any changes in the gross margin throughout that period? In the past, you've talked about optimizing dollars more so than percentages. But just on the percentage side, does it go up, down? Is there volatility as you go from one to the next for any reason? Just wondered on the trajectory there.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nRoss, thank you for the question. At a very high level, each generation, we actually provide much more capabilities, more memory, help our customer more. So in general, the gross margin should progress each generation when you offer more capabilities to your customers. But typically, when you first ramp at the beginning of ramp of a generation, it tends to be lower. When you get to the scale, get to the yield improvement, the test improvement, and also overall performance improvement, you will see gross margin improving within each generation. So it's kind of a dynamic gross margin. But in the longer term, you should expect each generation should have a higher gross margin.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks for that, Jean. Then one small segment of your business, but it seems quite volatile. You talked a little bit about further off than you usually do, is the gaming side of things. What is the magnitude down you're talking about this year? Because in 2025, you thought it was going to be flat. And it ended up growing 50%, which was a nice positive surprise. But now that you're talking about this year being down, but then the next-gen Xbox ramping in 2027, I just hope to get some color on what you see as kind of the annual trajectory there.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nYeah. So Lisa can add more. So 2026, actually, it's the seventh year of a current product cycle. Typically, when you're at this stage of the cycle, revenue tends to come down. We do expect the revenue on the semi-customer revenue side to come down significantly, double-digit for 2026, as Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks. For the next generation?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Yeah. I think we'll certainly talk about that going forward. But as we ramp the new generation, you would expect a reversal of that.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (VP of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations)\nOperator, I think we have time for one more caller on the call, please. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOur final question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Relative to the ramp of your rack-scale systems, would you expect any kind of bottleneck in terms of supply constraints in terms of the ramp as you ramp the second half of the year to potentially impact or limit the revenue growth? In other words, maybe talk about whether you expect supply to really kind of meet the growth in Q4 sequentially relative to sorry, Q3 relative to Q4.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah. Jim, we are planning this at every component level. So I think relative to our data center AI ramp, I do not believe that we will be supply-limited in terms of the ramp that we put in place. I think we have an aggressive ramp. I think it's a very doable ramp. And as we think about the size and scale of AMD, clearly, our priority is ensuring that the data center ramps go very well. And that's both on the data center AI, the GPU side, as well as on the CPU side.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you. And then maybe as a follow-up to the earlier question on OPEX, could you maybe address what are some of the largest investment areas you made in 2025? And then what are the largest incremental OPEX investment areas for 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, Jim. On the 2025 investment, the priority and the largest investment in data center AI, our hardware roadmap, we accelerated that roadmap. We expand our software capabilities. We also acquired ZT Systems, which add significant system-level solutions and capabilities. Those are the primary investment in 2025. We also invest heavily in go-to-market to really expand our go-to-market capabilities to support revenue growth and also expand our commercial business and enterprise business for our CPU franchise. In 2026, you should expect us to continue to invest aggressively. But as Lisa mentioned earlier, we do expect revenue to expand faster than operating expense increase to drive the earnings per share expansion.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nAll right. Thank you, everybody, for participating on the call. Operator, I think we can go ahead and close the call now. Thank you. Good evening.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question-and-answer session. That also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a great rest of the day.",

And with that, I will hand the call over to Lisa.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered an outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability reflecting broad-based demand across our data center AI, server, and PC businesses. Revenue grew 36% year over year to $9.2 billion. Net income rose 31% and free cash flow more than tripled, led by record EPYC, Ryzen, and Instinct processor sales. Our record third-quarter performance marks a clear step up in our growth trajectory as a combination of our expanding compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center AI business drives significant revenue and earnings growth. Turning to our segments, data center segment revenue increased 22% year over year to a record $4.3 billion, led by the ramp of our Instinct MI350 series GPUs and server share gains.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nServer CPU revenue reached an all-time high as adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors accelerated rapidly, accounting for nearly half of overall EPYC revenue in the quarter. Sales of our prior-generation EPYC processors were also very robust in the quarter, reflecting their strong competitive positioning across a wide range of workloads. In cloud, we had record sales as hyperscalers expanded EPYC CPU deployments to power both their own first-party services and public cloud offerings. Hyperscalers launched more than 160 EPYC-powered instances in the quarter, including new Turin offerings from Google, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, and others that deliver unmatched performance and price performance across a wide range of workloads. There are now more than 1,350 public EPYC cloud instances available globally, a nearly 50% increase from a year ago.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nAdoption of EPYC in the cloud by large businesses more than tripled year over year, as our on-prem share gains are driving increased demand from enterprise customers for AMD cloud instances to support hybrid compute. We expect cloud demand to remain very strong as hyperscalers are significantly increasing their general-purpose compute capacity as they scale their AI workloads. Many customers are now planning substantially larger CPU buildouts over the coming quarters to support increased demands from AI, serving as a powerful new catalyst for our server business. Turning to enterprise adoption, EPYC server sell-through increased sharply year over year and sequentially, reflecting accelerating enterprise adoption. More than 170 fifth-gen EPYC platforms are in market from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro, and others, our broadest portfolio to date, with solutions optimized for virtually every enterprise workload.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe close large new wins in the quarter with leading Fortune 500 technology, telecom, financial services, retail, streaming, social, and automotive companies as we expand our footprint across major verticals. The performance and TCO advantages of our EPYC portfolio, combined with our increased go-to-market investments and the expanded breadth of offerings from the leading server and solutions providers, position us well for continued enterprise share gains. Looking ahead, we remain on track to launch our next-generation 2-nanometer Venice EPYC processors in 2026. Venice silicon is in the labs and performing very well, delivering substantial gains in performance, efficiency, and compute density. Customer pull and engagement for Venice are the strongest we have seen, reflecting our competitive positioning and the growing demand for more data center compute.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nMultiple cloud and OEM partners have already brought their first Venice platforms online, setting the stage for broad solution availability and cloud deployments at launch. Turning to data center AI, our Instinct GPU business continues to accelerate. Revenue grew year over year, driven by the sharp ramp of MI350 series GPU sales and broader MI300 series deployments. Multiple MI350 series deployments are underway with large cloud and AI providers, with additional large-scale rollouts on track to ramp over the coming quarters. Oracle became the first hyperscaler to publicly offer MI355X instances, delivering significantly higher performance for real-time inference and multimodal training workloads on OCI ZetaScale Supercluster. Neocloud providers Crusoe, DigitalOcean, TensorWave, Vultr, and others also began ramping availability of their MI350 series public cloud offerings in the quarter. MI300 series GPU deployments with AI developers also broadened in the quarter.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nIBM and Zyphra will train multiple generations of future multimodal models on a large-scale MI300X cluster, and Cohere is now using MI300X at OCI to train its command family of models. For inference, a number of new partners, including Character AI and Luma AI, are now running production workloads on MI300 series, demonstrating the performance and TCO advantages of our architecture for real-time AI applications. We also made significant progress on the software front in the quarter. We launched ROCm7, our most advanced and feature-rich release to date, delivering up to 4.6x higher inference and 3x higher training performance compared to ROCm6. ROCm7 also introduces seamless distributed inference, enhanced code portability across hardware, and new enterprise tools that simplify the deployment and management of Instinct solutions. Importantly, our open software strategy is resonating with developers.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nHugging Face, VLLM, SGLang, and others contributed directly to ROCm7, as we make ROCm the open platform for AI development at scale. Looking ahead, our data center AI business is entering its next phase of growth, with customer momentum building rapidly ahead of the launch of our next-gen MI400 series accelerators and Helios Rack Scale solutions in 2026. The MI400 series combines a new compute engine with industry-leading memory capacity and advanced networking capabilities to deliver a major leap in performance for the most demanding AI training and inference workloads. The MI400 series brings together our Silicon software and systems expertise to power Helios, our Rack Scale AI platform. Designed to redefine performance and efficiency at data center scale.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nHelios integrates our Instinct MI400 series GPUs, Venice EPYC CPUs, and Pensando NICs in a double-wide rack solution optimized for the performance, power, cooling, and serviceability required for the next generation of AI infrastructure and supports Meta's new open rack wide standard. Development of both our MI400 series GPUs and Helios rack is progressing rapidly, supported by deep technical engagements across a growing set of hyperscalers, AI companies, and OEM and ODM partners to enable large-scale deployments next year. The ZT Systems team we acquired last year is playing a critical role in Helios development, leveraging their decades of experience building infrastructure for the world's largest cloud providers to ensure customers can deploy and scale Helios quickly within their environments. In addition, last week we completed the sale of the ZT manufacturing business to Sanmina and entered a strategic partnership that makes them our lead manufacturing partner for Helios.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nThis collaboration will accelerate large customer deployments of our Rack Scale AI solutions. On the customer front, we announced a comprehensive multi-year agreement with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs, with the first gigawatt of MI450 series accelerators scheduled to start coming online in the second half of 2026. The partnership establishes AMD as a core compute provider for OpenAI and underscores the strength of our hardware, software, and full-stack solutions strategy. Moving forward, AMD and OpenAI will work even more closely on future hardware, software, networking, and system-level roadmaps and technologies. OpenAI's decision to use AMD Instinct platforms for its most sophisticated and complex AI workloads sends a clear signal that our Instinct GPUs and ROCm open software stack deliver the performance and TCO required for the most demanding deployments.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe expect this partnership will significantly accelerate our data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years. Oracle announced they will also be a lead launch partner for the MI450 series, deploying tens of thousands of MI450 GPUs across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure beginning in 2026 and expanding through 2027 and beyond. Our Instinct platforms are also gaining traction with sovereign AI and national supercomputing programs. In the UAE, Cisco and G42 will deploy a large-scale AI cluster powered by Instinct MI350X GPUs to support the nation's most advanced AI workloads. In the US, we are partnering with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Labs to build Lux AI, the first AI factory dedicated to scientific discovery, together with our industrial partners OCI and HPE.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nPowered by our Instinct MI350 series GPUs, EPYC CPUs, and Pensando networking, Lux AI will provide a secure open platform for large-scale training and distributed inference when it comes online in early 2026. The US Department of Energy also selected our upcoming MI430X GPUs and EPYC Venice CPUs to power Discovery, the next flagship supercomputer at Oak Ridge, designed to set the standard for AI-driven scientific computing and extend US high-performance computing leadership. Our MI430X GPUs are designed specifically to power nation-scale AI and supercomputing programs, extending our leadership powering the world's most powerful computers to enable the next generation of scientific breakthroughs. In summary, our AI business is entering a new phase of growth and is on a clear trajectory towards tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027, driven by our leadership, Rack Scale solutions, expanding customer adoption, and an increasing number of large-scale global deployments.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nI look forward to providing more details on our data center AI growth plans at our Financial Analyst Day next week. In client and gaming, segment revenue increased 73% year over year to $4 billion. Our PC processor business is performing exceptionally well, with record quarterly sales as the strong demand environment and breadth of our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth. Desktop CPU sales reach an all-time high, with record channel sell-in and sell-out led by robust demand for our Ryzen 9000 processors, which deliver unmatched performance across gaming, productivity, and content creation applications. OEM sell-through of Ryzen-powered notebooks also increased sharply in the quarter, reflecting sustained end-customer pull for premium gaming and commercial AMD PCs.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nCommercial momentum accelerated in the quarter, with Ryzen PC sell-through up more than 30% year over year as enterprise adoption grew sharply, driven by large wins with Fortune 500 companies across healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, automotive, and pharmaceuticals. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunity to continue growing our client business faster than the overall PC market, based on the strength of our Ryzen portfolio, broader platform coverage, and expanded go-to-market investments. In gaming, revenue increased 181% year over year to $1.3 billion. Semi-custom revenue increased as Sony and Microsoft prepare for the upcoming holiday sales period. In gaming graphics, revenue and channel sell-out grew significantly, driven by the performance-per-dollar leadership of our Radeon 9000 family. FSR4, our machine learning upscaling technology that boosts frame rates and creates more immersive visuals, saw rapid adoption this quarter, with the number of supported games doubling since launch to more than 85.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nTurning to our embedded segment, revenue decreased 8% year over year to $857 million. Sequentially, revenue and sell-through increased as the demand environment strengthened across multiple markets, led by tests in emulation, aerospace and defense, and industrial vision and healthcare. We expanded our embedded product portfolio with new solutions that extend our leadership across adaptive and x86 computing. We began shipping industry-leading Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs to lead customers, delivered our first Versal RF development platforms to support several next-generation design wins, and introduced the Ryzen embedded 9000 series with industry-leading performance per watt and latency for robotics, edge computing, and smart factory applications. The design momentum remains very strong across our embedded portfolio.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe are on track for a second straight year of record design wins, already totaling more than $14 billion year to date, reflecting the growing adoption of our leadership products across a broad range of markets and expanding set of applications. In summary, our record third-quarter results and strong fourth-quarter outlook reflect the significant momentum building across our business, driven by sustained product leadership and disciplined execution. Our data center AI, server, and PC businesses are each entering periods of strong growth, led by an expanding TAM, accelerating adoption of our Instinct platforms, and EPYC and Ryzen CPU share gains. The demand for compute has never been greater, as every major breakthrough in business, science, and society now relies on access to more powerful, efficient, and intelligent computing. These trends are driving unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nI look forward to sharing more on our strategy, roadmaps, and long-range financial targets at our Financial Analysts meeting next week. Now I'll turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our third-quarter results. Jean?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. We're pleased with our strong third-quarter financial results. We delivered a record revenue of $9.2 billion, up 36% year over year, exceeding the high end of our guidance, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Our third-quarter results do not include any revenue from shipment of the MI308 GPU products to China. Revenue increased 20% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the data center and client and gaming segment, and modest growth in the embedded segment.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nGross margin was 54%, up 40 basis points year over year, primarily driven by product mix. Operating expenses were approximately $2.8 billion, an increase of 42% year over year as we continue to invest aggressively in R&D to capitalize on significant AI opportunities and go-to-market activities for revenue growth. Operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 24% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense, and other totaled $273 million. For the third quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $1.20 compared to $0.92 a year ago, an increase of 30% year over year. Now turning to our reportable segments, starting with the data center. Data center segment revenue was a record of $4.3 billion, up 22% year over year, primarily driven by the strong demand for fifth-generation EPYC processors and Instinct MI350 series GPUs. On a sequential basis, data center revenue increased 34%.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nPrimarily driven by strong ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPUs. The data center segment operating income was $1.1 billion, or 25% of revenue, compared to $1 billion a year ago, or 29% of revenue, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to capitalize on significant AI opportunities. Client and gaming segment revenue was a record of $4 billion, up 73% year over year and 12% sequentially, driven by strong demand for the latest generation of client and graphics processors and stronger sales of console gaming products. In the client business, revenue was a record $2.8 billion, up 46% year over year and 10% sequentially, driven by record sales of our Ryzen processors and the richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.3 billion, up 181% year over year and 16% sequentially, reflecting higher semi-custom revenue and strong demand for our Radeon GPUs.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nClient and gaming segment operating income was $867 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $288 million, or 12% a year ago, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by increase in go-to-market investment to support our revenue growth. Embedded segment revenue was $857 million, down 8% year over year. Embedded was up 4% sequentially as we saw certain end-market demand strengthen. Embedded segment operating income was $283 million, or 33% of revenue, compared to $372 million, or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to lower revenue and end-market mix. Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the sale of ZT Systems Manufacturing business to Sanmina last week. The third-quarter financial results of the ZT Manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nTurning to the balance sheet and the cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operating activities of continuing operations, and the free cash flow was a record of $1.5 billion. We returned $89 million to shareholders through share repurchases, resulting in $1.3 billion in share repurchases for the first three quarters of 2025. Exiting the quarter, we have $9.4 billion authorization remaining and our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent, and short-term investment was $7.2 billion. Our total debt was $3.2 billion. Now turning to our fourth quarter 2025 outlook, please note that our fourth quarter outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China. For the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately $9.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nThe midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 25% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong double-digit growth in our data center and client and gaming segment, and a return to growth in our embedded segment. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 4%. Driven by double-digit growth in the data center segment, with strong growth in server and continued ramp of our MI350 series GPUs. A decline in our client and gaming segment, with client revenue increasing and gaming revenue down strong double digits. And double-digit growth in our embedded segment. In addition, we expect fourth-quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54.5%. And we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.8 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be gain of approximately $37 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%. And diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.65 billion shares.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nIn closing, we executed very well, delivering record revenue for the first three quarters of the year. The strategic investment we are making positions us well to capitalize on expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling shareholder value creation. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (VP of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations)\nThank you very much, Jean. John, we can go ahead and poll the audience for questions now.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the queue. You may press star two to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys.\n\n**Operator**\nWe ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. One moment while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThank you for the question. I had a near-term and a medium-term question. For the near-term, Lisa, I was hoping if you could give us some sense of the CPU/GPU mix in Q3 and Q4. And just tactically, how are you managing this transition from your MI355 towards MI400 in the second half of next year? Can you continue to grow in the first half of next year from these Q4 levels, or should we expect some kind of pause or digestion before customers get on board the MI400 series?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSure, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So a couple of comments.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe had a very strong Q3 for the data center business. I think we saw strong outperformance in both the server as well as the data center AI business. And a reminder that that was without any MI308 sales. The MI355 has ramped really nicely. We expected a sharp ramp into the third quarter, and that proceeded well. And as I mentioned, we've also seen some strengthening of the server CPU sales. And not just, let's call it near-term, but we're seeing our customers are giving us some visibility in the next few quarters that they see elevated demand, which is positive. Going into the fourth quarter, again, strong data center performance, up double digits sequentially, and up in both server and data center AI, again, on the strength of those businesses.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nAnd to your question, I mean, we're not diving into 2026 yet, obviously, but given what we see today, we see a very good demand environment into 2026. So we would expect that MI355 continue to ramp in the first half of 2026. And then. As we mentioned, MI450 series comes online in the second half of 2026, and we would expect a sharper ramp as we go into the second half of 2026 of our data center AI business.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nGot it. And from my follow-up, there is some industry debate, Lisa, about OpenAI's ability to kind of simultaneously engage with all three merchants and the ASIC suppliers, just given the constraints around power and CapEx and their existing kind of CSP partners and so forth. So how are you thinking about that?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nWhat is your level of visibility in the initial engagement, and then, more importantly, how it kind of broadens out into 2027? Is there a way that one can model what the allocation would be, or just how should we think about the level of visibility in this very important customer? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nYeah, absolutely, Vivek. Look, we're very, obviously, very excited about our relationship with OpenAI. It's a very significant relationship. Think about it as it's a pretty unique time for AI right now. There's just so much compute demand across all of the workloads. I think in our work with OpenAI, we are planning multiple quarters out, ensuring that the power is available, that the supply chain is available. The key point is the first gigawatt we will start deploying in the second half of 2026, and that work is well underway.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nAnd we continue, just given where lead times are and things like that, we are planning very closely with OpenAI as well as the CSP partners to ensure that we're all prepared with Helios so that we can deploy the technology as we stated. So I think overall, we're working very closely together. I think we have good visibility into the MI450 ramp, and things are progressing very well.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director of Equity Research)\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results. I had a first question on Helios. Obviously, with the announcement of OCP, customer interaction has to be growing. Could you talk about into next year, what your view is on discrete sales versus system sales? When do you see that crossover kind of happening?\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director of Equity Research)\nAnd just what initial responses have been from customers after getting a better look at it at the show?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nYeah, sure. Tom, thanks for the question. There's a lot of excitement around MI450 and Helios. I think the OCP reception was phenomenal. We had numerous customers and, frankly, bringing their engineering teams to understand more about the system, more about how it's built. There's always been some discussion about just how complex these rack scale systems are, and they certainly are. And we are very proud of the Helios design. I think it has all of the features, functions, reliability, performance, power performance that you would expect. I think the interest in MI450 and Helios has just expanded over the last number of weeks, certainly with some of the announcements that we've made with OpenAI and OCI, as well as the OCP show with Meta.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nI think overall, from our perspective, I think things are going really well in both the development as well as the customer engagement there. So in terms of rack scale solutions, we would expect that the early customers for MI450 will really be around the rack scale solutions. We will have other form factors as well for the MI450 series, but there's a lot of interest in the full rack scale solution.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director of Equity Research)\nSuper helpful. Then as my follow-up, it's a broader question as well and similar to kind of what Vivek asked. If you look at the power requirements that are out there for some of the early announcements into next year, they're pretty substantial. Then you also have component issues that you're seeing across interconnected memory. Just from your perspective as an industry leader, where do you think that the constraint will be?\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director of Equity Research)\nWill it come first with components not being available, or do you think that both data center footprint in terms of infrastructure and/or power is the gating factor to some of these deployments into next year, just as we really see some larger numbers start to get deployed? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nYeah, sure, Tom. I think what you're pointing out is what we as an industry have to do together. The entire ecosystem has to plan together, and that is exactly what we're doing. We're working with our customers on their power plans over the next, actually, I would say, two years. From a silicon and a memory and a packaging and a component supply chain, we're working with our supply chain partners to make sure all of that capacity is available.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nI can tell you from our visibility, we feel very good that we have a strong supply chain that is prepared to deliver sort of these very significant growth rates and large amounts of compute that is out there. I think all of this is going to be tight. There is a—you can see from some of the CapEx spending that there's a desire to put on more compute, and we're working closely together. I will say that the ecosystem is very—I would say works very hard when there are these types of, let's call it, tightness out there. We also see things open up as that we're working, getting more power, getting more supply, all of those things. The net-net is I think we are well positioned to grow significantly as we transition into the second half of 2026, into 2027 with the MI450 and Helios.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research)\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Actually, I wanted to start on the CPU side. You and your largest competitor in that space have talked about near-term strength supporting AI workloads on general-purpose servers from Agentic. Maybe you could speak to the sustainability of these trends. They called out supply constraints. Are you seeing any of those in your supply chain? And are we in a period where we should think about the CPU business on the data center side as being aseasonal, or should we expect normal seasonality in the first half of next year? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSure, Josh. So a couple of comments on the CPU server side. I think we've been watching this trend for the last couple of quarters.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nAnd we started seeing, let's call it, some positive signs in CPU demand, actually, a couple of quarters ago. And what's happened as we've gone through 2025 is now we see sort of a broadening of that CPU demand. So we have a number of our large hyperscale clients are now forecasting significant CPU builds into 2026. And so from that standpoint, I think it's a positive demand environment. And it is because AI is requiring quite a bit of general-purpose compute, and that's great. It catches our cycle as we're ramping Turin. So the Turin ramp has gone extremely fast, and we see good pull for that product, as well as consistent, strong demand for our general product line as well. So back to seasonality as we go into 2026, I think we expect that the CPU demand environment into 2026 is going to be, let's call it, positive.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nAnd so we'll guide more as we get into the end of the year, but I would expect a positive demand environment for CPUs as we see this demand. I do feel like it's durable. It is not a short-term thing. I think it is a multi-quarter phenomenon as we're seeing just much more demand as these AI workloads really turn into have to do real work.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nSo, Josh, on the supply side, we have supplies to support our growth, and especially in 2026, we're prepared for the ramp.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research)\nGot it. Thank you both. And for my follow-up, Lisa, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted progress you guys have made on ROCm 7. I know this has been an area of focus. And can you maybe spend a minute or two talking about where you feel you're at competitively with ROCm?\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research)\nHow wide is the breadth of support you're able to offer to the developer community? And what areas do you still have work to do to close any potential competitive gap? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nYeah, Josh, thanks for the question. Look, we've made great progress with ROCm. ROCm 7 is a significant step forward in terms of performance and sort of all the frameworks that we support. It's been really, really important for us to get sort of day-zero support of all the newest models and native support for all the newest frameworks. I would say most customers who are starting with AMD now have a very smooth experience as they're bringing on their workloads to AMD. There's obviously always more work to do.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe're continuing to augment the libraries and the overall environment that we have, especially as we go to some of the newer workloads where you see training and inference really coming together with reinforcement learning. But overall, I think very strong progress with ROCm. And by the way, we're going to continue to invest in this area because it's so important to really make our customer development experience as smooth as we can.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of C J Muse with Tanner Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, as you think about the 355 to 400 transition and moving to full rack scale, is there a framework that we should be thinking about for gross margins throughout calendar 2026?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nYes, C J, thanks for the question.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nI think in general, as we said in the past, for our data center GPU business, the gross margin continues to improve when we ramp a new generation of product. Typically, at the beginning of the ramp, you go through a transition period, then you will normalize the gross margin. We're not guiding 2026, but our priority in data center GPU business is to really expand the top-line revenue growth and the gross margin dollars. And of course, at the same time, we'll continue to drive a gross margin percentage up too.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. And I guess maybe, Lisa, to kind of probe kind of your growth expectations through 2026 and beyond, and you talked about tens of billions of dollars in 2027.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nCan you kind of speak at a high level how you're thinking about OpenAI and other large customers and how we should be thinking about the breadth of your customer kind of penetration throughout calendar 2026, 2027? Any help on that would be super. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSure, C J. And we'll certainly address this topic in more detail at our analyst day next week. But let me give you some maybe higher-level points. Look, I think we're really excited about our roadmap. I think we have seen great traction amongst the largest customers. The OpenAI relationship is extremely important to us. And it's great to be able to talk at the multi-gigawatt scale because I think that really is what we believe we can deliver to the marketplace. But there are numerous other customers that we are in deep engagements with. We talked about OCI.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe also announced a couple of systems with the Department of Energy that are significant systems. And we have many other engagements. So the way you should think about it is there are multiple customers that we would expect to have, let's call it, very significant scale in the MI450 generation. And that's sort of the breadth of the customer engagements that we've built. And it's also how we're dimensioning the supply chain to ensure that we can supply certainly our. OpenAI partnership as well as the numerous other partnerships that are well underway.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, for data center in the quarter, what grew more year over year. On a dollar-to-percentage basis, the servers or the GPUs? In data center.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nYeah, Stacy, I think our commentary was data center grew nicely year over year in both of the areas, both for servers as well as data center AI.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nYeah, but could you—I mean, just directionally, which one grew more than the other? I'm not even asking for numbers just directionally.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nDirectionally, they are similar, but servers a little bit better. Servers a little bit better.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nOkay. And then on the guidance. You said that servers—I mean, data center overall up double digits. You said servers up strong double digits. What does that mean? Is that more than 20%? Or how do I think about what you mean by strong double digits? Because again, I'm trying to—I mean, for the GPUs for the year, do you think you're—I mean, you were saying roughly like $6.5 billion or something last quarter for the year. Do you think it's still in that range? It kind of feels like they're still there.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO, and Treasurer)\nStacy, here's what we guided. We guided sequentially data center will be up double digits. And we said server will go up strongly. And at the same time, we also said that MI350 also going to ramp. So we did not—I don't think what you just mentioned was what we guided.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nOh, okay. So I mean, if you say servers are up strongly, does that mean they're up more than the Instinct? Because you didn't really make that commentary on Instinct.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nNo, look, Stacy, let me say it. So data center up sequentially double-digit percentage, both server and data center AI are going to be up as well. And from the standpoint of where they are, I think we're pleased with how both of them are performing. The strong double-digit percentage comment perhaps was applying to the year-over-year commentary.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Lisa, I know it's only been a month since you announced this idea with OpenAI, but can you give us maybe some anecdotes of how this has influenced your position in the market with other customers? Are you engaged with customers that you wouldn't have been engaged with if you hadn't done this deal? That's the first part of the question. And then the second part relates to a prior question, which is that it looks like they could be something like half of your data center GPU revenue in the 2027, 2028 timeframe. So how much risk in your mind is there around that single customer for you?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSure, Tim. So let me say a couple of things.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nFirst of all, the OpenAI deal has been in the works for quite some time. We're happy to be able to talk about it broadly and also talk about the scale of the deployment and the scale of the engagement being multi-year, multi-gigawatt. I think all those things were very positive. We've had a number of other engagements as well. I think over the last—if you were asked to ask specifically over the last month—I would say that. It's been a number of factors. I think the OpenAI deal was one of them. I think. Being able to show the Helios rack in full force at OpenCompute was also a very important milestone because people could see the engineering and sort of the capabilities of the Helios rack. And if you're asking whether we've seen an increase of interest or an acceleration of interest, I think the answer is yes.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nI think customers are broadly engaged and perhaps broadly engaged at a higher scale, which is a good thing. And then from the standpoint of customer concentration, I think a very key foundation for us in this business is to have a broad set of customers. We've always been engaged with a number of customers. I think we're dimensioning the supply chain in such a way that we would have ample supply to have multiple customers at similar scale as we go into the 2027, 2028 timeframe. And that's certainly the goal.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Technology Analyst)\nYeah, thanks for taking the question.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Technology Analyst)\nI'm curious on the server strength that you're seeing, if there's a way to unpack how we think about unit growth versus ASP expansion as we move through the Turin product cycle. And how do you guys just kind of think about that going forward?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nYeah. So, Aaron, on the server CPU side, Turin certainly is more content. So we see ASPs grow as Turin ramps. But I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're actually seeing a very good mix of Genoa still there. So Turin is ramping very quickly, but we are also seeing Genoa demand continue well as the hyperscalers are not able to move everything to the latest generation immediately. So from our standpoint, I think it's broad-based CPU demand across a number of different workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nThis is a little bit, let's call it server refresh, but it seems like from our customer conversations, the workloads are broadly due to the fact that AI workloads are spawning more traditional compute, so more buildout is necessary. I think going forward, one of the things that we see is there is more of a desire for the latest generation. And so as much as we're happy with how Turin is ramping. We're seeing actually a strong pull on Venice and a lot of early engagements in Venice, which kind of says a lot about kind of the importance of general-purpose compute at this point in time.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Technology Analyst)\nYeah, thanks. As a quick follow-up, I'm curious and not to steal maybe the discussion from next week, but Lisa, you've been very consistent, like 500 billion of total AI silicon TAM opportunity and obviously progressing above that.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Technology Analyst)\nI'm curious, as we think about these large megawatt kind of deployments, how you think about the updated views on that AI silicon TAM as we look forward.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWell, Aaron, as you said, not to take too much away from what we're going to talk about next week. Look. We're going to give you a full picture of how we see the market next week, but suffice it to say, from everything that we see, we see the AI compute TAM just going up. So we'll have some updated numbers for you, but the view is whereas 500 billion sounded like a lot when we first talked about it, we think there is a larger opportunity for us over the next few years, and that's pretty exciting.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from Antoine Chikaban with New Street Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Antoine Chkaiban** (Equity Research Analyst)\nHi, thank you so much for taking my question. So I'd like to ask about whether the developing relationship with OpenAI could be a tailoring to the development of your software stack. Can you maybe tell us about how the collaboration works in practice and whether the partnership contributed in making ROCm more robust?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nYeah, Antoine, thanks for the question. I think the answer is yes. I think all of our large customers contribute to, let's call it a, broadening and deepening of our software stack overall. I think the relationship with OpenAI is certainly one where our plans are to work deeply together on hardware as well as software as well as systems and future roadmap. And from that standpoint, the work that we're doing together with them on Triton is certainly very valuable.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nBut I will say beyond OpenAI, the work that we do with all of our largest customers are super helpful to strengthen the software stack. And we have put significant new resources into not just the largest customers, but we are working with a broad set of AI native companies who are actively developing on the ROCm stack. We get lots of feedback. I think we've made significant progress in the training and inference stack, and we're going to continue to double down and triple down in this area. So more customers that use AMD, I think all of that goes to enhancing the ROCm stack. And we'll talk a little bit more about this next week, but we're also using AI to. Help us accelerate the rate and pace of some of the ROCm kernel development and just the overall ecosystem.\n\n**Antoine Chkaiban** (Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks, Lisa.\n\n**Antoine Chkaiban** (Equity Research Analyst)\nAnd maybe as a quick follow-up, could you tell us about the useful lives of GPUs? I know that most CSPs depreciate them over five, six years, but in your conversations with them, I'm just wondering if you see or hear any early indication that in practice they may be planning to sweat those GPUs for longer than that.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nI think we have seen some early indications of that, Antoine. I think the key point being. Clearly, there's a desire to get on the latest and greatest GPUs when you're building new data center infrastructure. And certainly when we're looking at MI355s, they're often going into. New liquid-cooled facilities, MI450 series as well. But then we're also seeing the other trend, which is there's just a need for more AI compute. And from that standpoint, some of the older generations, MI300X is still doing quite well in terms of just where we see people deploying and using, especially for inference. And from that standpoint. I think you see a little bit of both.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director and Semiconductor Industry Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you. You mentioned MI308. I guess what's your posture there to the extent that if there is some relief that you're able to ship, do you have readiness to do that? Can you give us a sense for how much of a swing factor that could be?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSure, Joe. So look, it's still a pretty dynamic situation with MI308. So that's the reason that we did not include any MI308 revenue in the Q4 guide. We have received some licenses for MI308, so we're appreciative of the administration supporting some licenses for MI308.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe're still working with our customers on the demand environment and sort of what the overall opportunity is. And so we'll be able to update that more in the next couple of months.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director and Semiconductor Industry Analyst)\nOkay. But you do have. Product to support that market. If it does open up, or are you going to have to start to kind of rebuild inventory for that?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe've had some work in process. I think we continue to have that. Work in process, but we'll have to see sort of how the demand environment shapes up.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director and Semiconductor Industry Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nThanks.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (VP of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations)\nOperator, I think we might have time for just one more caller, please. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nNo problem. And the final question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nThanks for squeezing me in.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nLisa, this might take longer than the amount of time we have left before the top of the hour, but there's been so many of these multi-gigawatt announcements from OpenAI. How does AMD truly differentiate in there? When you see that big customer signing deals with other GPU vendors and ASIC vendors, etc., how do you attack that market differently than those competitors to not only get the 6 gigawatt initially, but hopefully more after that?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSure, Ross. Well, look, what I see is actually this environment where the world needs more AI compute. And from that standpoint, I think OpenAI has kind of led in the quest for more AI compute, but they're not alone. I think when you look across the large customers, there is really a demand for more AI compute as you go forward over the next couple of years.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nI think we each have our advantages in terms of how we are positioning our products. I think MI450 series in particular, I think, is an extremely strong product, rack-scale solution. Overall, when we look at compute performance, when we look at memory performance, we think it's extremely well-positioned for both inference as well as training. I think the key here is time to market, its total cost of ownership. Its deep partnership, and thinking about not just MI450 series, but what happens after that. So we're deep in conversations on MI500 and beyond. And we certainly think we're well-positioned to not only participate, but participate in a very meaningful way across the sort of the demand environment here. And I think we have certainly learned a ton over the last couple of years with our AI roadmap.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWe've made significant inroads in terms of just what the largest customer needs from a workload standpoint. So I'm pretty optimistic about our ability to capture a significant piece of this market going forward.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nGreat. And I guess as my follow-up, it'll be a direct follow-on to that. You did a unique structure by granting some warrants with this deal. And I know they've asked according to a price that would be very creative and make everybody happy. Do you think that was a relatively unique agreement, or given that the world needs more processing power, that AMD is open to somewhat similar, conceptually similar creative ways to address that demand over time with other equity vehicles, etc.?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSure, Ross. So I would say it was a unique agreement from the standpoint that unique time in AI.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nWhat we wanted, what we prioritized was really deep partnership and multi-year, multi-generation, significant scale. And I think we got that. We got a structure that has extremely aligned incentives. Everybody wins, right? We win, OpenAI wins, and our shareholders win. Sort of benefits from this, and all of that accrues to the overall roadmap. I think as we look forward, I think we have a lot of very interesting partnerships that are developing, whether they're with the largest AI users or you think about sovereign AI opportunities. And we look at each one of these as a unique opportunity where we're bringing sort of the whole of AMD. Both technically as well as all the rest of our capabilities to the party.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair and CEO)\nSo I would say OpenAI was pretty unique, but I would imagine that there are lots of other opportunities for us to bring our capabilities into the ecosystem and participate in a significant way.\n\n**Operator**\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question and answer session, and that also concludes today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce to you Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nThank you, and welcome to AMD's twenty twenty five second quarter financial results conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and the accompanying slides. If you have not had the chance to review these materials, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of amd.com. We will refer primarily to non GAAP financial measures during today's call. The full non GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press release and slides posted on our website.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nParticipants in today's conference call are Doctor. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer and Jean Hu, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website. Before we begin, I would like to note that Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer will present at Citi's twenty twenty five Global TMT Conference on Wednesday, September 3. And Forrest Norad, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Data Center Solutions Business Unit will present at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Technology Conference on Monday, September 8.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nToday's discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speaks only as of today and as such involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered very strong second quarter results with revenue exceeding the midpoint of guidance as higher EPYC and Ryzen processor sales more than offset headwinds from export controls that impacted Instinct sales. We set records for both EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales, reflecting the broad based demand for our differentiated high performance data center, PC and embedded processors. Second quarter revenue increased 32% year over year to a record $7,700,000,000 and we delivered over $1,000,000,000 in free cash flow. Excluding the $800,000,000 inventory write down related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year over year margin expansion led by a richer product mix.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nTurning to the segments, Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year over year to 3,200,000,000.0 We saw robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for emerging AI use cases. In particular, adoption of AgenTeq AI is creating additional demand for general purpose compute infrastructure as customers quickly realize that each token generated by a GPU triggers multiple CPU intensive tasks. Against this backdrop, fifth gen EPYC TURN shipments ramped significantly and we had sustained demand for our prior generation EPYC processors. As a result, we set records for both cloud and enterprise CPU sales and delivered our thirty third consecutive quarter of year over year share gains. In cloud, adoption expanded with the largest hyperscalers as they deployed Epic to power more of their mission critical infrastructure, services and public cloud products.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nMore than 100 new AMD powered cloud instances launched in the quarter, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle Cloud that deliver up to twice the performance of our previous generation, which were already the industry's highest performing offerings. There are now nearly 1,200 EPYC Cloud instances available globally as providers continue expanding both the breadth and regional availability of their AMD offerings. This continued expansion is accelerating enterprise adoption of Epic in the cloud with deployments growing significantly from the prior quarter as we closed large wins with dozens of large aerospace streaming, financial services, retail and energy companies. EPYC adoption also grew with telecom customers as providers modernize their infrastructure for next generation networks. For example, KDDI announced plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its five gs virtualized network.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd Nokia selected Epic for its cloud platform used by service providers to build, deploy and manage core network functions. Turning to enterprise on prem adoption, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and Super Micro launched 28 new TURN platforms in the quarter that deliver leadership performance, efficiency and TCO across a wide range of enterprise workloads. EPIC enterprise deployments grew significantly from the prior quarter, supported by new wins with large technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services and public sector customers. To extend our momentum with SMB and hosted IT service customers, we launched the EPYC 4,005 series that combine enterprise grade performance and features in cost optimized platforms, purpose built for smaller scale deployments. Turning to HPC, AMD now powers more than one third of the world's fastest supercomputers, including El Capitan and Frontier, which retained the number one and number two spots on the latest top 500 list.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe also powered 12 of the top 20 systems on the green 500, highlighting the performance per watt advantages of EPYC and Instinct for large scale deployments. Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our server CPU business, driven by durable tailwinds, including growing demand for cloud and on prem compute, sustained share gains and the growing investments in general purpose infrastructure required to enable AI. Turning to our Data Center AI business, revenue declined year over year as U. S. Export restrictions effectively eliminated MI-three zero eight sales to China and we began transitioning to our next generation MI-three 50 series accelerators.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe made solid progress with MI300 and MI325 in the quarter, closing new wins and expanding adoption with Tier one customers, next generation AI cloud providers and end users. Today, seven of the top 10 model builders and AI companies use Instinct, underscoring the performance and TCO advantages of our data center AI solutions. We launched our Instinct MI350 series with industry leading memory bandwidth and capacity and broad adoption across hyperscalers, AI companies and OEMs. From a competitive standpoint, MI355 matches or exceeds B200 in critical training and inference workloads and delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at significantly lower cost and complexity. For at scale inferencing, MI355 delivers up to 40% more tokens per dollar, providing leadership performance and clear TCO advantages.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWith the MI three fifty series, we're also expanding our system level capabilities to support deployments powered by AMD CPUs, GPUs and NICs. As one example, Oracle is building a 27,000 plus node AI cluster combining MI355 X Accelerators, fifth Gen EPYC TURN CPUs and Polarra 400 SmartNICs. We began volume production of the MI350 Series ahead of schedule in June and expect a steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large scale production deployments with multiple customers. Our sovereign AI engagements accelerated in the quarter as governments around the world adopt AMD technology to build secure AI infrastructure and advance their economies. As one example, we announced a multibillion dollar collaboration with Humane to build AI infrastructure powered entirely on AMD CPUs, GPUs and software.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nInitial deployments are underway in key regions with quarterly expansions planned over the coming years. In addition, we have more than 40 active engagements globally and see significant opportunities to power an increasingly larger portion of national computing centers and sovereign AI initiatives. On the AI software front, we made significant progress this quarter, increasing the performance, improving the usability and expanding the adoption of ROCCM. We announced ROCCM seven with major upgrades across every layer of the stack, delivering more than 3x higher inferencing and training performance compared to our prior generation and adding support for large scale training, distributed inference and lower precision data types. To deepen developer engagement, we introduced nightly ROCCM builds and expanded access to instant compute infrastructure, including launching our first developer cloud that provides pre configured containers for instant access to AMD GPUs.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe also expanded native support for ROCCM across key frameworks, including VLLM and SGLANG, enabling frontier models like LAMA-four, Gemma-three and DeepSeek R1 to launch with DayZero AMD support. To accelerate enterprise adoption, we introduced Rockham Enterprise AI, a full stack platform that integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and includes everything needed for an enterprise to deploy, manage and scale AI across their business. Looking ahead, the development of our next generation MI400 series is progressing rapidly. These are the most advanced GPUs we have ever built with up to 40 petaflops of FP4 AI performance and 50% more memory, memory bandwidth and scale out throughput than the competition. With the MI400 series, we're bringing together everything we've learned across silicon software and systems to deliver Helios, a full stack rack scale AI platform.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nHelios is purpose built for the most demanding AI workloads with each rack connecting up to 72 GPUs that can operate as a single massive AI accelerator. Helios is expected to deliver up to a 10x generational performance increase for the most advanced frontier models. And we believe it will be the highest performance AI system in the world when it launches. MI-four 100 series development is progressing well towards our planned launch in 2026 with significant interest in large scale deployments from multiple high profile customers. To accelerate our development, we have invested significantly to expand our AI software and hardware capabilities, both organically and inorganically with a number of acquisitions and strategic investments.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe strengthened our software stack last quarter with the addition of the Brium and Lamini teams, building on our acquisitions of Nod dot ai, Nipsology and Silo dot ai. On the hardware side, we added a world class rack and data center scale design team in the second quarter with our acquisition of ZT Systems. The ZT team is integrated seamlessly and they are actively engaging with multiple customers to accelerate deployments of our Helios solutions at scale. We also announced last quarter that Sannina intends to acquire ZT's U. S.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nBased manufacturing business, becoming our lead partner for AI rack manufacturing. Turning to the AI regulatory environment, earlier this quarter, we were notified by the Department of Commerce that it is moving forward with the review of our license applications to export MI-three zero eight to China. We appreciate the focus the Trump administration is placing on assuring that The U. S. Technology remains central to global AI infrastructure and we expect to resume MI-three zero eight shipments as licenses are approved subject to end customer demand and supply chain readiness.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAs our licenses are still under review, we are not including any MI-three zero eight revenue in our third quarter guidance. Despite that, we expect Instinct revenue to grow year over year in the third quarter, driven by the ramp of MI350 at multiple customers. In Clients and Gaming, segment revenue increased 69% year over year to 3,600,000,000 driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our semi custom game console SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Client revenue increased 67% year over year to $2,500,000,000 led by record desktop CPU sales. Demand for our latest generation Ryzen 9,000 series was strong, especially for our differentiated X3D processors.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe delivered record desktop channel CPU sales as Ryzen processors consistently topped the best selling CPU lists at major global e tailers throughout the quarter. We also expanded our Zen five desktop portfolio with the launch of our latest Threadripper processors that feature up to 96 cores and deliver up to double the performance of the competition in many popular content creation and design workloads. In mobile, demand for AMD powered notebooks was strong with sellout growing by a large double digit percentage year over year. We drove a richer mix of higher ASP mobile parts year over year as we expanded our share in the premium notebook segment, where our Ryzen AI 300 CPUs deliver leadership performance and value for both general purpose and AI workloads. In commercial PCs, Ryzen adoption accelerated as OEM consumption increased more than 25% year over year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe saw a strong sell through for AMD commercial notebooks with Lenovo and HP and a significant uptick in Dell sales as they ramp availability of their AMD commercial portfolio. We also closed new enterprise wins with Forbes two thousand pharma, tech, automotive, financial services, aerospace and healthcare companies. We expect continue growing our commercial client share based on the strength of our product portfolio and expanded breadth of OEM offerings. Looking more broadly, we remain confident we can continue growing client processor revenue ahead of the market over the coming quarters, driven by increased adoption of our desktop and notebook products, growing commercial momentum and a richer product mix. In gaming, revenue increased 73% year over year to 1,100,000,000.0 Semi custom revenue increased by a large double digit percentage year over year as console inventories normalized and our customers began preparing for the holiday season.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe announced a new multi year collaboration with Microsoft for custom chips that will power the next generation of Xbox devices, including consoles, PCs and handhelds. We also deepened our collaboration with Sony through Project Amethyst, a co engineering program that will use machine learning to power the next wave of immersive gaming experiences. In PC gaming, demand for our latest generation Radeon 9,000 series GPUs was very strong with desktop GPU sell through accelerating in the quarter as demand outpaced supply. We launched the Radeon 9,600 XT extending the performance advantages of RDNA four to mainstream gamers and delivering a significant uplift in gaming performance, including more than double the ray tracing of our prior generation. As part of our end to end AI strategy, we introduced the Radeon AI Pro R9700 GPU for local inferencing, model fine tuning and other data intensive workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nThe R9700 features more memory, full ROCCM support and multi GPU scalability, enabling advanced AI development and deployment directly on the desktop. Turning to our Embedded segment, revenue decreased 4% year over year to $824,000,000 Demand continues recovering gradually with sell through in the second quarter picking up as strength in most markets was offset by a few pockets of softness and inventory reduction actions, largely with industrial customers. We expanded our embedded portfolio with the first production shipments of Spartan UltraScale plus FPGAs that deliver leadership performance and advanced security for cost sensitive low power applications. Adoption of our Versal Adaptive SoCs continues expanding in high end applications, including next generation Robotaxi platforms developed by Bosch in Europe, where Versal serves as a high performance controller, enabling real time processing, security and encryption in fully electric automated vehicles. Looking ahead, we expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications and aerospace markets will drive a return to sequential growth in the 2025.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nLonger term, design win momentum continues to build tracking ahead of this point last year and putting us on pace to surpass the record $14,000,000,000 in design wins we achieved in 2024. In summary, demand is very strong across our product portfolio and we are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, led by the steep ramp of MI350 Series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen share gains. Our server and PC CPU businesses are accelerating, driven by growing demand for high performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio and expanded go to market investments. Our embedded and gaming businesses are returning to growth and are well positioned for long term success supported by strong design win momentum. And in AI, we are seeing strong adoption of our MI350 Series and ROCCM seven as we deliver leadership performance and TCO advantages across a broader range of workloads and ramp deployments with an expanded set of cloud and enterprise customers.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nLooking ahead, we see a clear path to scaling our AI business to tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. We are very excited about our next generation MI400 series, which is another giant step forward on our roadmap and has been designed to deliver leadership performance at the chip, server and rack levels. Customer interest for the MI-four 100 series is very strong and we're actively engaging with an expanding set of customers to support large scale deployments in 2026. We are in the early stages of an industry wide AI transformation that will drive a step function increase in compute demand across all of our markets, positioning us for significant revenue and earnings growth over the coming years. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the 2025. We are pleased with our strong second quarter financial results. We delivered record revenue of 7,700,000,000.0 exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, up 32% year over year, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Record sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and the higher semi customer shipment more than offset the impact of The U.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nS. Export controls, restricting MI308 sales to China. Revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the client and the gaming segment, partially offset by the data center revenue decrease due to export controls. Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. The decrease was due to the $800,000,000 inventory and the related charges associated with the export restrictions.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nExcluding this charge, non GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%. Operating expenses were approximately $2,400,000,000 an increase of 32% year over year as we continue to invest aggressively in go to market activities for revenue growth and in R and D to capitalize on significant future AI expansion opportunities. Operating income was $897,000,000 representing a 12% operating margin compared to $1,300,000,000 or 22% a year ago. The decline was primarily due to the inventory and the related charges. Taxes, interest expense and other totaled 126,000,000 For the 2025, diluted earnings per share were $0.48 compared to $0.69 a year ago.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nThe inventory and the related charges reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.43 Now turning to our reportable segment, starting with the data center. Data center segment revenue was $3,200,000,000 up 14% year over year, driven by strong added CPU revenue and the share gains across both cloud and enterprise customers. On a sequential basis, data center revenue decreased 12% due to the impact of the XBOP controls on MI-three zero eight. The data center segment operating loss was $155,000,000 compared to operating income of $743,000,000 a year ago or 26% of revenue. The loss was primarily due to the inventory and related charges.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nClient and Gaming segment revenue was $3,600,000,000 up 69% year over year and 20% sequentially, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our PC and console gaming products. In the client business, revenue was a record of $2,500,000,000 up 67% year over year, driven by record sales of our Ryzen desktop CPUs and the richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to 1,100,000,000 up 73% year over year, reflecting strong demand for our newly launched gaming GPUs and higher semi customer revenue as inventory has now normalized and the customers prepare for the holiday season. Client and Gaming segment operating income was $767,000,000 or 21% of revenue compared to $166,000,000 or 8% a year ago, driven by richer client product mix and operating leverage on higher revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $824,000,000 down 4% year over year and flat sequentially as embedded end market demand remains mixed.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nEmbedded segment operating income was $275,000,000 or 33% of revenue compared to $345,000,000 or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to product mix. Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of ZT Systems early in the second quarter as we had announced our intent to divest ZT manufacturing business. The financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statement as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non GAAP financials. Subsequently, in May, we entered into agreement with the Samina Corporation to sell the ZTE manufacturing business for $3,000,000,000 in cash and stock, inclusive of contingent payment.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nThe transaction is expected to close near the 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and the customary closing conditions. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1,500,000,000 in cash from operating activities of continuing operations. And the free cash flow was a record of $1,200,000,000 We returned $478,000,000 to shareholders through share repurchase, resulting in $1,200,000,000 in share repurchases for the 2025. In May, our Board of Directors approved additional $6,000,000,000 authorization.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nExiting the quarter, have 9,500,000,000 remaining under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short term investment were $5,900,000,000 Our long term debt was $3,200,000,000 During the quarter, we paid down $950,000,000 of commercial paper used to finance the ZT system acquisition close. Now turning to our third quarter twenty twenty five outlook. Please note that our third quarter outlook does not include the annual revenue from AMD Instinct MI-three zero eight shipment to China, as our license applications are currently under review by U. S.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nGovernment. For the 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately 8,700,000,000.0 plus or minus $300,000,000 The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year over year revenue growth, driven by strong double digit growth in our client and the gaming and the data center segments. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 13%, driven by strong double digit growth in the data center segment with the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 Series GPU product, modest growth in our client and gaming segment with the client revenue increasing and the gaming revenue to be flattish. And our embedded segment revenue to return to growth. In addition, we expect third quarter non GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54% and we expect non GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 2,550,000,000 We expect net interest and other expenses to be again of approximately $10,000,000 We expect our non GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1,630,000,000.00 shares.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nIn closing, we executed very well in the first half of the year, delivering record revenue and building strong momentum for growth in the second half. The strategic investment we're making position us to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling value creation. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q and A session.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nOperator, will you please poll the audience for questions? Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nYes. Thank you, Matt. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. And the first question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Thomas O’Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nHey, thank you for taking my questions and I appreciate it. Lisa, I wanted to start on the client business. So you had previously laid out a second half outlook that was roughly flattish with the first half as you're kind of protecting against some pull forward. So first, do you think that your Q2 results included some pull forwards and the second half should still be flattish? And longer term after the Intel commentary regarding 18A, maybe what that means as a knee jerk reaction just right away for AMD longer term in terms of share in ASPs?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, Tom. Thanks for the question. So first of all, our client and gaming segment, and particularly our client business, just performed very well in the first half of the year. I think if you look at the entire first half, was up 68% year over year. I think if you look underneath that, what we're seeing is strength in every part of our client business.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo we saw very strong sales in our desktop channel area. We have a leadership product there, best gaming GPUs with our X3D GPUs. We've had strong Ryzen AI adoption as well in the first half of the year. We see that in sell through. And in addition, we've had strong enterprise sell through as we brought that forward.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo to your question of how much is pulled forward, we don't think a whole lot of that is. We actually when we look at the sell through patterns, the end user consumption is actually quite strong In terms of going into the second half of the year, as we said in Q3 guide, the primary driver of our Q3 guide is a very strong data center driven by MI350 ramping. We are expecting some growth in the client business. So I wouldn't say it'll be flat to the first half, but it will be we're planning for it to be a little bit less than seasonal, just given some of the uncertainties out there.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nBut the client business is performing extremely well for us. We believe we are gaining share in all the right places. So if you look at the numbers in the first quarter, and it will show through in the second quarter as well, a lot of the uplift in revenue is in ASPs. And that is basically, we're selling up the stack on the strength of our portfolio. And I think we're still quite underrepresented in the enterprise portion of the business.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nThat is where we have increased our go to market resources and focus, and we're seeing nice traction there, especially with the portfolios that we have from HP and Lenovo in enterprise PCs. And now we're adding Dell as well as it's ramping here, started in the second quarter, we'll ramp more in the second half of the year. So I think all of those are tailwinds for our client business beyond the 2025, but really into the next number of quarters as we think about the portfolio and the opportunities for us.\n\n**Thomas O’Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nSuper helpful. And then secondly, was hopeful you could provide us a little more color on China. So the guide doesn't include MI-three zero eight, but perhaps you could comment on when you get approval, if the supply chain is ready, what's currently in inventory and maybe compare what you think the contribution will look like versus the $700,000,000 in Q2 and the $800,000,000 for the second half you spoke about in April?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, Tom. So yes, let me answer some of the questions on China. I'm sure that there are some questions. Look, we're very pleased with the progress that's been made with the administration over the last couple of months. We've been working very closely with the administration.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI think the focus here on ensuring that US technology gets utilized throughout the world is something that we certainly support and very much want to contribute to. China is an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under review now. We are working with the Department of Commerce to get those reviewed. We do expect that once those licenses are approved, we will start MI-three zero eight shipments.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nIn terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods. So it was work in process and it'll take us a couple of quarters to run through that. The exact timing of revenue and contribution will depend a bit on when those are when the licenses are actually granted. But overall, I think this is a better position than we were ninety days ago. And we certainly view China as a market that we would like to service with MI-three zero eight.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd we're working closely with the administration to do that.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThank you for taking my question. Lisa, if we look into 2026, right, that's when I think the sovereign opportunity could get quite meaningful for AMD. What is the right way to size that? You know, what does this JV structure structure mean with some of the contracts that you have signed? Would you consider this incremental to the kind of growth rate that you're seeing with your current MI business, or would this be instead of?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nSo just if you could give us a way to size what is that incremental opportunity from sovereign customers when it comes to 26, is it dependent on MI 400, right? In which case it might be more backup data, etcetera. So, just some ways to think about sovereign for AMD next year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we're really excited about the overall AI opportunity for us with MI three fifty five and the MI 400 series as we go through the back half of this year and into 2026. I think it's there's a very large opportunity with, let's call it hyperscalers, some of the leading AI companies as well as Sovereign. I think Sovereign is additive to that for sure. From the standpoint of what to expect, there are also some regulatory things that need to be worked through on the sovereign side. But again, we were working closely with the administration as they go through the various regulatory decisions that need to be made.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nBut from my perspective, I think the fact that countries want their own sovereign computing capability is very, very clear. I think we see that all over the world. The humane opportunity that you're referring to that we announced with the Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia, think is a great example of where together with their ambitions, our technology, I think you heard from Tarek that was he was at our event saying that that would start with MI-three 55, that we would expect that that would continue on. I think what's attractive about our offering is our open ecosystem. And I think that really resonates with the sovereign community.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nBut to your original question, I think it's an additive opportunity and it's one that we believe will continue to be very important for us going forward with both MI-three 55 as well as the MI-four 100 series.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nAnd for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margins for your MI product. So I understand in the early days, right, it has been dilutive. What kind of sales level is required for it to start becoming, you know, additive to margins? And let's say if I fast forward to Q4 and assume that, you know, your Q4 sales are growing year on year roughly the same rate as Q3 sales, Should we expect gross margins to kind of stay at these Q3 levels? Or are there other plusminus drivers we should think about in terms of gross margins as you go into Q4? Thank you.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYes. Vivek, thank you for the question. The gross margin of our MI product, we said it's a little bit below corporate average. I think at this point, our priority is really to address the larger, faster growing revenue opportunities that we have and provide customers the better TCO to really expand our presence in the marketplace. I think that the way to think about our gross margin, there are different dynamics, right, different customers, different generations.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nBut also our operation team has been continuing to really drive operational efficiency to improve our MI family's gross margin. That has been ongoing. So it's not necessarily really tied to, okay, the revenue level each quarter, but you should think about is a trend in the longer term, it should improve continually going forward. Overall, the way I think about these gross margin dollars, right, this is one of the fastest growing market opportunities for any financial metrics, gross margin dollars is what we try to grab as much as we can. Hopefully, that helped your question.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Lisa, so my question is on data center GPU. You did say that June is up year over year, so it sounds like it's maybe a little more than $1,000,000,000 And you use words like strong ramp into the back half of the year. Can you give us just any color on what that means? Can you get to say $7,000,000,000 for the year?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nAnd can you give us some maybe a milepost on what you're assuming for Q3 would be great?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. I think what we said in the prepared remarks is that we are seeing a strong ramp from Q2 into Q3. MI-three fifty five, we actually started production in June. So we had some shipments in sort of in the month of June, but it really is ramping as we go through this quarter and the third quarter.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo in terms of guideposts, we said it would grow year on year from last year and that I think is a strong ramp. And then we would expect it to grow into the fourth quarter as well. The demand, I should say, what we're seeing from customers is, I think, really positive around MI 355. Sort of the way I would contrast it with maybe the MI 300 ramp, I think MI 300 started with perhaps some smaller deployments. I think what we're seeing with MI355 is very competitive versus the B200, GB200 family of products.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI think there's a strong desire to really use us at scale. The MI-three 55 is very strong for inferencing. We're also working with a number of customers on training. And this is also an opportunity for us to build into the MI-four 100 series as we go into 2026. So we're bullish on MI-three 55 and where the AI opportunity is for us.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd I think we're right on track to what we expected to be as we were going through the development of the roadmap.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. And then Lisa, just on that point also, you did talk about a new developer cloud. So, obviously, you're beginning you're, you know, beginning to lease back some of the, you know, capacity that you're selling into the clouds and the neo clouds. Is that gonna be a material portion of the revenue you're gonna recognize for MI $3.55 in the back half of the year? Can you just talk about that and maybe how to think about how much demand that's going to stimulate and what the ultimate goal is for that cloud? Thanks.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYeah, so there are a couple of things in that question. So let me answer. So the developer cloud is simply we want to make it super easy for developers to get on AMD Instinct GPUs. One could say, again, if we look back at the MI300 family, we were very focused on the largest hyperscalers and the largest customers. But there's a lot of interest in our GPUs across a number of customers who just wanted easier access.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd so by ensuring that developer cloud is there, that it has ready to deploy containers, you can run training and inference easily, you don't necessarily have to make longer term commitments. I think that's the purpose of the Developer Cloud. I don't think it adds meaningfully to revenue in the second half of the year, but it certainly adds to customers getting experience with AMD. I think the larger revenue opportunities for us are really with large customer adoption as they ramp to larger deployments. And we're very actively trying to get those deployments up and running as soon as possible.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nOne of the things just as a reminder that the MI355 is, given that it's similar a infrastructure to MI300, we actually think it's going to ramp very quickly and very well for customers. And I think that's one of the attractive portions of it as well.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nHi, thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, want to go back to the instinct side of things and the MI 355 ramp. It looks like the second half is going to ramp really significantly. You said it's going to be up year over year in the third quarter. I believe a quarter ago, you said roughly the same thing, and the MI-three 08 is out of both numbers, so that shouldn't really matter, and I guess it would be upside.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nBut I just wondered how have things changed from a quarter ago as far as the MI-three 50 family adoption, especially because you launched a little bit early. Is the growth a little bit more than you would have expected a quarter ago, about the same or a little worse? Just any sort of color on that would be helpful.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYes, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the main thing I would say is, I think the adoption is a bit faster than we might have expected. Again, whenever you launch a product, we want to make sure that we go through the full validation and all of that with our customers. I think there's a lot of interest, broad based interest in MI-three 55. And so I feel like over the last ninety days, I think we've had significant sort of new customer interest and that's certainly positive.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWill say, I'm sorry, Ross, I was just going to add, our engagements are, I think the other pieces, I think there's also a lot of excitement around MI-four Hundred and what we can do with the Helios rack. And so there are a number of customers who based on sort of the strong roadmap that we're showing, to get familiar and really work with us earlier in the life cycle, which I think is again positive.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nGreat, thank you for that. I guess as my follow-up, an earlier question you talked about a little bit below seasonality in the second half of the year for your client business. It seems like there's just I don't even know if seasonality is a framework that matters, but how are you thinking about that for the second half as a whole for a client? And then gaming was just up a huge amount sequentially in the second quarter. You described a little bit of what you're expecting there.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nBut how do you think about seasonality for the second half in its entirety in the gaming side as well?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYes, let me try and then Jean might add if you want a little bit more color. So the way to think about it is, we do expect some growth sequential growth in clients as we go into the third quarter. I would say, sort of single digit type growth. We continue to see good traction for our products in that portfolio. On the gaming side, I would call it flattish to Q2.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd we're coming off of such a strong Q2 that I think flattish is actually to be expected. As we go into the fourth quarter, the dynamics that we would see is, we would see that the console business would actually be down substantially. So think about it as down strong double digits. The customers usually build for the holiday season sort of before that and then that will be completed by the fourth quarter. So we would expect as the client and gaming segment that the segment would probably be down in the fourth quarter.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo hopefully that helps. Jean, did you want to add to that?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nNo, I think you covered it.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director - Equity Research)\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lead times on your on the Instinct family both for the MI three fifty group family and MI 400. I mean, as you move into larger cluster sizes, which it sounds like you're doing at least with Oracle on three fifty and then endeavor to do more so on 400, how much visibility and lead time do you need from your customers? Because I would imagine the lead time for your parts is measured in months, but on the infrastructure side in particular for the larger scale deployments, I mean, those things are measured in years at this point.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director - Equity Research)\nSo maybe you could speak to the visibility specifically on the 400. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYes, sure, Josh. So, yes, I mean, our lead times are long given all of the processing steps that we have to go through. Think about it as somewhere between eight, nine months, that type of thing. We have a very, very strong supply chain. We've been preparing for these ramps of both MI350 series and MI400 series, and that preparation is ongoing.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo, we feel like we have a very strong supply chain there. In terms of visibility with customers, we're absolutely working with customers very closely on near term MI350 Series deployments, getting those deployments up as quickly as possible. Again, one of the things about the MI350 series that is good is that it can go into existing data centers, just given the platform that it is in. So we have been certainly working with our customers there. And then for the MI400 series, there are lots and lots of details sort of full rack scale design implementation and we're actively working with the largest customers right now on just ensuring that our Helios rack is fully compatible with their data center build outs as we go into 2026.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo that visibility is important. I think that co development, co engineering is important as we get into the RackScale architecture. And the ZT team that we brought in has been extremely, extremely helpful in terms of both internal platform build out as well as ensuring that we're working closely with our customers on their data center needs.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director - Equity Research)\nThank you for that, Lisa. Maybe for Gene, I wanted to follow-up on Vivek's question earlier on gross margins. So if we add back the charges in 2Q and then your gross margin implied in the guidance is roughly flat sequentially. And that's despite what's implied to be data center GPUs up meaningfully sequentially. Like it doesn't seem like console is falling off in the third quarter.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director - Equity Research)\nI mean, you maybe talk to the underlying drivers of how you're able to keep the flat gross margins despite what sounds like still margin dilutive data center GPUs up significantly within the mix? Thank you.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYes. Justin, thanks for the question. Yes, we are guiding our Q3 gross margin around 54%. And Q2, you're right, excluding the $800,000,000 charge, was close to 54%. I think the gaming business actually is quite high.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nSo the mix actually is unfavorable. But we do have some tailwinds that we have been really driving. First is we have been expanding our server business, which has really nice gross margin. And then on the client business side, we are expanding the commercial PC business. So that really helps us to drive the gross margin up.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nIn addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin improvement just from operational efficiency perspective across the board. So overall, our objective is to continue to improve gross margin despite MI350 very strong ramp in Q3, we are able to continue to drive the margin up.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nGreat, thank you. You've used this language before of the kind of tens of billions opportunity around MI-four hundred. Can you talk about the timeframe when that might occur and not to pin you down too much, but and what would help you get to that level sooner rather than later? Should we think of that as a 2027 realistic outcome that you could be looking at 20,000,000,000 plus? Just a little bit more color on that tens of billions comment.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYeah, I mean, maybe without being specific, Joe, I can give you sort of the way I look at it and back to this notion of, are we incrementally more confident? I think we're seeing a lot of positive signs in our AI customer adoption. I think the strength of the MI350 series, the very positive feedback that we're getting on MI400 from customers, the work that we're doing in terms of ensuring that we are fully ready for large scale deployments of not just inference, but training. I think when we get to tens of billions of dollars, we're talking about significant gigawatt scale type deployments. And those would be important for us to get there.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd we're certainly, I think, engaged with all of the right customers that can enable that type of ramp. But I won't necessarily speculate on the exact time other than to say, certainly that would be our set of aspirations.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nGreat, that's helpful. Thank you. And then as these workloads evolve, I mean, you've sort of talked about inference and training as sort of different opportunities for AMD. Are you seeing those start to come together? It seems like with inference, the reasoning models are requiring much higher complexity.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nIs rack scale more important to the inference market than you thought it might be? Just any color around how that complexity of inference is impacting you guys?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYeah, think that's absolutely true, Joe. I think with the proliferation of models, I think what we're seeing is GPUs continue to be very sort of the computing of choice as you think about all the models that are out there. And then as you go into distributed inference and some of the newer techniques, we are seeing the importance of the scale up and scale out architecture, which we are investing in. But I think the overarching thing is, think we have a very competitive roadmap across the next couple of generations. I think that has now gotten strong customer validation.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe're getting a lot of feedback from customers on where they would like to see us continue to add more resources and add more focus. And so that is very helpful. And the key is to be a full scale solution provider for these large customer deployments. That's what we're working on.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I guess the first question is, when we look at the data center guide, Gene, you had alluded to double digit sequential growth. Obviously, the MI three fifty five series kind of ramping.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nI'm curious, how could we conceptualize what you're expecting in the server side? And where do you think your market share is today in traditional enterprise servers outside of cloud?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYes. I think when you look at our data center business, we do have a strong double digit growth, both the server and MI both sides are growing sequentially. Of course, MI ramp is the most significant one. As far as the server market share, we do think we continue to drive the market share up compared to Q1. Not a third party has not published a report yet, but we feel really good about the Q2 market share increase versus Q1.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nErin, if I just add to that, one of the things that it's important for people to understand is in some of the cloud CapEx numbers that have come out that have been quite positive, That is not only a GPU statement, but there's actually significant CPU CapEx in there as well. We've started to see more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side, because all of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well. And so we're very bullish on the opportunity in servers. I think the team has really executed extremely well. I mean, if you look at our portfolio now, Turin and Genoa are very well adopted, broadening workloads.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nEnterprise adoption is also increasing. And so I think all of those are positive for the server opportunity in the 2025, as well as going into 2026 and beyond.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nYeah. And then as a follow-up, I'm kind of thinking about the China, the MI-three zero eight opportunity. When we do see a license, I think you alluded to this earlier, it's going to take a little bit of time to kind of ramp and get the supply chain to satisfy the demand. But I'm curious, the 800,000,000 write down that you had taken, is there no kind of finished inventory there? Does that come back?\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nDo you have any reversal aspects of that once a license gets approved?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nLet me start first, then Lisa First, on the $800,000,000 majority of them are WIPs. We really don't have on the shelf finished goods that we can ship immediately. So we do need to take time if we get a license. That's perfect.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYeah, thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess Lisa was hoping you could level set us on the instinct ramp into 2026. How are thinking about the timing of the handoff three fifty to four hundred? How are you thinking about Helios contributions?\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nAnd I guess very importantly from a customer contribution perspective, how you might see that evolve from traditional hyperscalers to perhaps more sovereign and Neo Cloud within the mix?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, CJ. So certainly as second half this year, it's all about MI three fifty five ramp into first half of next year. I think the MI 400 series development is right on track. The development of the Helios platform is also right on track. We would expect significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd then relative to the contribution of the various things hyperscalers, sort of some of the versus Neo Clouds versus Sovereign. I think it's a little early to really talk about the different pieces other than to say, you would expect that hyperscalers and let's call it Neo Clouds that would be working for other large AI natives, maybe significant pieces of the initial ramp. And then sovereign may come a little bit later in time, just given sort of the timing of when different build outs would happen. So hopefully that gives you some color, CJ.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYes, very helpful. And then Jean, I guess a question for you with the sale of ZT for $3,000,000,000 of cash and stock and you only have $3,000,000,000 of debt outstanding. How are you thinking about the use of proceeds? Is there saving for a rainy day or bolt on acquisitions, perhaps more aggressive share buyback? How are you thinking about it today?\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYes, thanks for the question. Our business model actually generate a lot of free cash flow as you see in Q2, free cash flow generation was $1,200,000,000 So if we close the ZT sale and we'll get more cash. Overall, our capital allocation principle continue to be the first things investing, especially with the tremendous AI opportunities ahead of us. And then we'll continue to return cash to shareholders. We did a $1,200,000,000 repurchase in the first half of the year.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nWe are committed to continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchase.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nOperator, I think we have time for one more caller, please.\n\n**Operator**\nOkay. The final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (MD &amp; Head - Technology Research)\nHey, thanks for squeaking me in here. I wanted to clarify a little bit on the $1,000,000,000 increase in sequential sales. It would seem like it's coming from GPUs primarily. I was wondering if you could back that. And that's with nothing in China.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (MD &amp; Head - Technology Research)\nAnd if the answer to the prior question that GPUs are over $1,000,000,000 that kind of puts you at a $2,000,000,000 run rate. And I was just wondering if that was accurate in terms of thinking. And then I have just a very quick follow-up. Thanks.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nHi, Ben. Thanks for the question. If you look at the sequential revenue increase, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we see data center strong double digit increase, which include both GPU and the CPU, but the GPU definitely drives largest incremental amount increase. We also mentioned the client actually is going to increase sequentially. In addition, the embedded business will return to sequential growth.\n\n**Jean Hu** (EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nSo multiple business contributed to sequential increase, but the majority of increase is really driven by MI three fifty five with a strong ramp.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (MD &amp; Head - Technology Research)\nOkay, great. And then if indeed that gets you pretty close to a couple billion dollars, if the MI-three 100 comes in, do you see it at the same run rate that you exited? And then you have the ability to get at that 800 mil run rate right away? Or you think it will take several quarters to ramp when you get the license? Thanks.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYeah, Ben, it will take some time to ramp just given particularly today. I mean, we're sitting already in early August. So I don't think you would see a lot of it in Q3. But certainly, as licenses would be approved, would schedule that and it would take a little while to ramp.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nAll right, operator, thank you very much. We appreciate everybody that joined the call today and we just like to end the call now. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nYep, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

You will also find detailed discussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, in particular, AMD's most recent quarterly report on Form 10 Q and annual report on Form 10 ks. And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered an outstanding start to the year despite the evolving dynamics related to tariffs and the regulatory environment. Growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter year over year, driven by strength in our core businesses and expanding data center and AI momentum. Revenue and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates as Instinct AI Accelerator, EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales grew significantly year over year. As a result, first quarter revenue increased 36% year over year to 7,400,000,000.0 as our Data Center and Client and Gaming segments both grew by a large double digit percentage.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe expanded gross margin year over year for the fifth straight quarter and increased net income by 55%, driven by a higher overall percentage of data center product sales and a richer Ryzen processor mix. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, our first quarter performance highlights the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and execution and positions us well for strong growth in 2025. Turning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 57% year over year to 3,700,000,000 We gained server CPU share driven by the ramp of our latest fifth gen EPYC TURN processors and sustained demand for fourth gen EPYC. Hyperscaler demand remained strong as cloud providers expanded EPYC deployments to to power their critical infrastructure and public services.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nMore than 30 new instances launched from Alibaba, AWS, Google, Oracle, Tencent and others in the quarter, including the initial wave of fifth gen EPYC Turing instances. In addition, AWS launched new FPGA accelerated instances in the quarter powered by EPYC processors with Xilinx Vertex FPGAs that are optimized for data and compute intensive workloads like genomics, multimedia processing, network security and cloud based video broadcasting. Every major cloud provider is deep in development on Turin programs with a steady stream of public instances and internal deployments expected to ramp into production over the coming quarters. Enterprise adoption of EPYC instances was very strong in the quarter. The number of EPYC powered cloud instances activated by Forbes two thousand enterprise customers more than doubled year over year, including new wins with Internet native streaming, transportation, financial services and social media companies.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nFor example, CrowdStrike achieved major performance improvements by broadly deploying EPYC instances across its multi cloud infrastructure. At the same time, we're also actively partnering with leading application and cloud providers to deploy EPYC optimized solutions tailored for specialized industry verticals. Siemens launched their latest software defined vehicle solution powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Pro GPUs on Azure, leveraging digital twin technology to significantly speed up automotive design and validation. Oracle launched a new version of its Exadata Database platform, which is used by more than half of the Fortune Global one hundred. The latest Exadata X11M has been optimized for fifth gen EPYC processors deliver up to 25% faster performance in transaction processing and analytics compared to the prior generation.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nTurning to enterprise on prem adoption, EPYC CPU sales grew by a large double digit percentage year over year for the seventh straight quarter, driven by new public sector wins and high volume deployments with large automotive, semiconductor, financial services, retail, energy and technology companies. We have built significant enterprise momentum over the last few years as our partners expanded the number of Epic based platforms to more than four fifty and we scaled our joint go to market programs. As a result, EPIC is now deployed by all of the top 10 telecom, aerospace and semiconductor companies, nine out of the top 10 automotive, seven out of the top 10 manufacturing, and six out of the top 10 energy companies on the Forbes two thousand. We expect enterprise adoption to accelerate over the coming quarters as more than 150 TURN platforms become broadly available from Dell, Cisco, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others. Looking forward, we see a clear path to continued share gains as customers ramp their fifth gen EPYC offerings that deliver unmatched performance, efficiency and TCO across every major cloud and enterprise data center workload.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe passed key milestones in April to begin manufacturing fifth gen EPYC at TSMC's new Arizona fab with first production shipments expected in the second half of twenty twenty five. Longer term, we announced our next gen EPYC Venice processors are the lead HPC products for TSMC's two nanometer process node. Venice silicon is in our labs and performing well, with bring up and validation progressing to plan to support a 2026 launch. Turning to our data center AI business. Revenue increased by a significant double digit percentage year over year as MI325X shipments ramp to support new enterprise and cloud deployments.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nMore than 35 MI-three hundred series platforms are in production from all the leading service providers, supporting the expanding number of Instinct GPU deployments with cloud, enterprise and AI customers. Several hyperscalers expanded their use of Instinct accelerators to cover an increasing range of generative AI search, ranking and recommendation use cases. We also added multiple Tier one cloud and enterprise customers in the quarter, including one of the largest frontier model developers that is now using Instinct GPUs to serve a significant portion of their daily inference traffic. The depth and breadth of our customer engagements continues to expand as breakthroughs in large scale AI models like OpenAI's O3 and DeepSeq's R1 drive increased demand for traditional inferencing and increasingly as a critical part of pre training. The industry leading memory capacity and bandwidth of our Instinct portfolio is ideally suited for these workloads, and we are actively working with multiple customers to scale Instinct from single node deployments to distributed inferencing clusters.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nTraining engagements also ramped in the quarter as multiple Tier one hyperscale AI and enterprise customers scaled Instinct GPU clusters to train internal and next gen frontier models. In parallel, we're making meaningful progress with sovereign AI deployments as countries expand investments to establish domestic nation scale AI infrastructure. In February, we announced a strategic partnership with G42 to build one of France's most powerful AI compute facilities powered by Instinct accelerators. On the AI software front, we significantly accelerated our release cadence in the first quarter, shifting from quarterly ROCCM updates to delivering ready to deploy training and inferencing containers on a biweekly basis that include performance optimizations and support for the latest libraries, kernels and algorithms. We expanded our open source community enablement in the quarter, making significantly more instant compute infrastructure available to enable developers to automatically build, test and deploy updates to Rock'em code nightly.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAs a result, more than 2,000,000 models on Hugging Face now run out of the box on AMD. We're also enabling an increasing number of models to launch with Day Zero support for Instinct accelerators, including Meta's LAMA-four, Google's Gemma-three and DeepSeq's R1 models that were released in the first quarter. Beyond launch, we are delivering regular software updates that increase performance for new models. For example, in the weeks following the launch of DeepSeq's R1 model, we introduced ROCCM optimizations that enabled MI 300 to deliver leadership inferencing throughput. We released ROCCM 6.4 in the quarter with major upgrades that increased training and inferencing performance across popular AI frameworks like PyTorch, JAX and VLLM.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nThe release also adds multiple ease of use features, including new cluster management tools that simplify the scaling and optimization of large scale Instinct deployments. Turning to our AI solutions capabilities. Earlier this quarter, we completed our acquisition of ZT Systems, adding world class systems design expertise to complement our silicon and software leadership. With ZT, we can provide ready to deploy rack level AI solutions based on industry standards built with AMD CPUs, GPUs and networking, reducing deployment time for hyperscalers and accelerating time to market for OEM and ODM partners. The team is fully engaged and already co designing with key customers on rack level designs optimized for our upcoming MI-four hundred series and working with customers and OEM partners to accelerate time to market for our MI350 series.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe have received significant interest in ZT's manufacturing business and expect to announce a strategic partner shortly. We began sampling our next gen MI350 Series with multiple customers in the first quarter and remain on track to begin accelerated production by midyear. MI350 Series performance is very strong based on the advances in architecture. We designed cDNA four to deliver leadership performance across a wide range of AI workloads, increasing memory capacity and bandwidth 1.5 x, adding support for new data types and improving network efficiency to deliver 35x higher throughput and performance compared to MI300x. Customer interest in the MI350 Series is very strong, setting the stage for broad deployment in the second half of this year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAs one example, we are partnering with Oracle to deploy a large scale cluster powered by Mi355X accelerators, fifth gen EPYC TURN processors and Polara four hundred AI NICs. This multibillion dollar initiative highlights the expanding AMD and OCI partnership and the growing demand for AMD Instinct to power the next wave of large scale AI infrastructure. Looking ahead, our MI400 series development remains on track to launch next year. The MI400 series is designed to deliver leadership performance for both inferencing and training, scaling seamlessly from single servers to full data center deployments. Early customer feedback has been very positive, marking a major step forward in our Instinct roadmap and significantly expanding our AI accelerator TAM as customers plan broader Instinct deployments to power a larger share of their AI infrastructure.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI'm looking forward to sharing more details on the MI350 Series, future MI400 Rack Scale solutions and the growing customer adoption of our Instinct platforms at our Advancing AI event on June 12. Turning to our Client and Gaming segment. Segment revenue increased 28% year over year to $2,900,000,000 Client revenue grew 68% year over year, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue share gains. We delivered record client CPU ASP, driven by a richer mix of high end desktop and mobile Ryzen processors. Desktop channel sellout increased by more than 50% year over year.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe set new sellout records in multiple regions as our latest generation Ryzen processors became the CPU of choice for gamers, topping bestseller lists at leading global e tailers. To build on this momentum, we extended our desktop CPU portfolio with the launch of our 16 core Ryzen 9,950 X3D processor that delivers significantly higher gaming and productivity performance than the competition. In mobile, AMD based notebook sell through was very strong in the quarter. We also saw strong demand for our latest generation AI PC processors as sales ramped, increasing by more than 50% quarter on quarter. The first notebooks powered by our new high end Ryzen AI Max plus and the first mainstream Ryzen AI seven and five three hundred series processors launched to very positive reviews.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nThese new processors set the standard for traditional computing and graphics performance, while also delivering unmatched AI capabilities and battery life, positioning Ryzen as a CPU of choice for gaming, ultra thin and commercial notebooks. Demand for AMD based commercial PCs was also very strong in the quarter. Ryzen Pro PC sell through grew more than 30% year over year, driven by new end customer wins and an 80% increase from 2024 in the number of AMD powered commercial systems from HP, Lenovo, Dell and ASUS. We closed multiple wins with large auto, energy, healthcare, financial services companies in the quarter. Looking more broadly across the PC market, we remain confident we can grow client processor revenue well ahead of the market in 2025, led by expanding adoption of our desktop channel and consumer and commercial notebook portfolio as well as a richer mix.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nTurning to our Gaming business results. Gaming revenue decreased 30% year over year as higher Radeon graphic sales were more than offset by lower semi custom sales. While our semi custom SoC sales declined year over year, console channel inventories have normalized and demand signals have strengthened for 2025. For PC gaming, we launched our Radeon 9,070 series to strong demand as our new RDNA four architecture delivers leadership performance for mainstream gamers. First week sellout set a record and was more than 10x higher than our previous best Radeon launch.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nDemand remains very strong and we are working closely with our board partners to replenish inventory weekly and meet the sustained demand. We also introduced FSR4, our first machine learning based rendering technology that delivers significantly higher frame rates and more immersive gaming experiences. FSR4 is already enabled in over 30 games with support expected to reach 75 titles by year end. Turning to our Embedded segment. First quarter revenue decreased 3% year over year to $823,000,000 Embedded demand continues to recover gradually.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe expect improving demand in the Test and Measurement, Communications and Aerospace markets will drive a return to growth in the second half of twenty twenty five. We completed initial shipments of our cost optimized Spartan UltraScale plus FPGAs and second generation Versal AI edge SoCs to meet growing demand for AI at the edge. As a part of continuing to grow our embedded x86 business, we launched our EPYC embedded 9,005 series CPUs that deliver leadership performance for networking, storage and industrial edge applications. Cisco selected our new EPYC embedded processors for their latest high end firewall solutions, and IBM is using them to power its latest storage scale system 6,000 for performance intensive enterprise analytics and AI workloads. We also released our latest Vitis AI software suite, expanding support for the latest models and accelerating edge AI deployment across a broader range of applications, further strengthening our leadership in the rapidly emerging edge AI market.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nIn summary, our strong first quarter results and second quarter outlook reflect the momentum we are building across our business. While we faced some headwinds from the dynamic macro and regulatory environments, including the recently announced export controls for Instinct MI-308X shipments to China, we believe they are more than offset by the powerful tailwinds from our leadership product portfolio. Against this backdrop, we remain confident we can deliver strong double digit percentage revenue growth in 2025 based on accelerating share gains with our latest generation of Zen five Epic and Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs and ramping production of our Instinct MI350 Series accelerators in the second half of the year to support an expanded set of customers and AI workloads. We also expect full year growth in our semi custom business and for our Embedded business to return to year over year growth in the second half of the year, driven by the reduced inventory levels and improving demand environment. To capitalize on our unprecedented growth opportunities and deliver our next major growth arc, we are expanding investments in our product and technology roadmaps, go to market initiatives and full stack AI software and data center scale solutions capabilities.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe're also doubling down on our execution to deliver and where possible accelerate our industry leading roadmaps. We view the current environment as a strategic opportunity to further differentiate AMD as we deliver an expanding product portfolio that combine leadership compute and AI capabilities for data centers, edge, PCs and embedded end devices. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal twenty twenty five. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, our first quarter fiscal year twenty twenty five financial statement disclosures include the combination of our client and the gaming businesses into a single reportable segment to align with how we manage the business. We continue to provide distinct revenue disclosures for our data center, client gaming and embedded businesses. We are pleased with our record first quarter revenue of $7,400,000,000 exceeding the high end of our guidance, up 36% year over year, driven by 57% revenue growth in the data center segment and a 28% revenue growth in the client and the gaming segment.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nRevenue declined 3% sequentially due to lower revenue in the embedded and data center segments, partially offset by sequential growth in the client and the gaming segment. Gross margin was 54%, up 140 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $2,200,000,000 an increase of 28% year over year, as we continue to invest aggressively in go to market activities and in R and D to address the significant growth opportunities ahead of us. Operating income was $1,800,000,000 representing a 24% operating margin. Taxes, interest expenses and other was $213,000,000 For the first quarter of twenty twenty five, diluted earnings per share was $0.96 an increase of 55% year over year.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nNow turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the data center. Data center segment revenue was $3,700,000,000 up 57% year over year, primarily driven by continued CPU server share gains across both the cloud and enterprise customers and the strong growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. On a sequential basis, data center segment revenue decreased 5%. Data center segment operating income was $932,000,000 or 25% of revenue compared to $541,000,000 or 23% a year ago.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nClient and Gaming segment revenue was $2,900,000,000 up 28% year over year, driven primarily by strong customer demand for our latest generation Zen five AMD Ryzen processor, partially offset by lower semi customer revenue. Client revenue was $2,300,000,000 up 68% year over year. More than half of the growth was driven by higher ASPs from a richer mix of high end Ryzen processors. On a sequential basis, the client and the gaming segment revenue increased by 2%, primarily driven by stronger than seasonal performance of our client product portfolio and increased the semi customer product revenue. Client and Gaming segment operating income was $496,000,000 or 17% of revenue compared to $237,000,000 or 10% of a year ago, driven by operating leverage on higher revenue.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nEmbedded segment revenue was $823,000,000 down 3% year over year. Embedded demand continues to recover gradually. Sequentially, embedded was down 11% consistent with our expectations. Embedded segment operating income was $328,000,000 or 40% of revenue compared to $342,000,000 or 41% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nDuring the quarter, we generated $939,000,000 in cash from operations. And our free cash flow for the quarter was $727,000,000 We returned $749,000,000 to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock and our repurchase program. We have a $4,000,000,000 remaining in our share repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short term investment was 7,300,000,000.0 Within the quarter, we reached CAD 1,500,000,000.0 of debt and issued CAD $950,000,000 of commercial paper to help fund our acquisition of ZT Systems, which was completed on March 31. Now turning to our second quarter twenty twenty five outlook.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nAs a reminder, in April, a new export license requirement was put in place for MI-three zero eight shipments to China, the impact of which is included in our guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately $7,400,000,000 plus or minus $300,000,000 This includes an estimated $700,000,000 revenue reduction as a result of the new export license requirement. Despite this headwind, the middle point of our guidance represents 27% year over year revenue growth. For the full year 2025, we estimated the revenue impact due to the XPOP license requirement to be approximately $1,500,000,000 Sequentially, we expect client and the gaming segment revenue to increase by double digit percentage. Embedded segment revenue to be flattish, and we expect data center segment revenue to decrease due to the exclusion of MI-three zero eight revenue.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nIn addition, we expect second quarter non GAAP gross margin is estimated to be 43%, inclusive of approximately $800,000,000 in charges for inventory and related reserves. Excluding this charge, our non GAAP gross margin would be approximately 54%. Non GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 2,300,000,000 which includes approximately $50,000,000 in OpEx due to the addition of the ZT Systems design team. The financials for the ZT manufacturing business will be reported as discontinued operations starting in the second quarter. We expect net interest and other expenses to be $5,000,000 due to the debt associated with the ZT system transaction.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nNon GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1,640,000,000.00 shares, which includes 9,000,000 shares related to the ZT transaction. Looking forward, despite ongoing macro and the trade policy related uncertainties, we believe the investment we are making will position us well to address the large growth opportunities ahead as AI expand the use of high performance computing across all our end market. In closing, 2025 is off to a strong start as we continue to execute on key strategic financial goals. We delivered strong top line revenue growth, expanded the growth and operating margins and closed the key acquisition of ZT Systems to expand and accelerate our data center GPU and the systems road maps. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q and A session.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nThank you very much, Jean. John, can you go ahead and pull the callers for the Q and A session, please? Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Matt. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. You. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOne moment please while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director - Equity Research)\nHi, team. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the results. I was hoping you maybe expand on the drivers of upside in both the Print and in particular the guide. How should we think about 2Q growth by segment? Wanted to double click on client in particular.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director - Equity Research)\nThat business is up 67% year over year in the first quarter and there's obviously a lot of concerns on pull ins. So I was hoping you could walk through some of the drivers of the strength in client in particular and how you're thinking about that in 2Q. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nOkay, great, Josh. Thanks for the question. Look, we were very pleased with our performance in Q1. We actually saw a strength across a number of our businesses. We saw strength certainly in the client business, very strong desktop performance.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe saw strength in our gaming business as well, which was really due to our strong Radeon launch. And we also saw some strength in our data center business across both stronger CPU and GPU. So those are some of the drivers for our Q1 performance. And in particular, on your question of client performance, we've certainly looked very carefully at the ordering patterns and what customers are telling us. We have not seen a lot of tariff related activity in that business.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI would say though, what we have seen is a real stronger mix and strength in our overall ASPs. So the desktop channel, which is an area where we have a very strong gaming products right now, actually performed well above seasonality in Q1. And that is really the strength of the ASPs there. So that's what we saw in Q1. And then to your question about the guide for Q2, as Jean mentioned, we do have the new export control limitation on MI-three 0 8.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo we have taken out that revenue, which is a $700,000,000 headwind in Q2. But with that, we have a strong outlook given the strength across the rest of our businesses. So we continue to see strength in clients going into the second quarter. Again, the desktop business continues to perform above typical seasonality. We're also seeing the beginning of the commercial ramp, which is a place where we have traditionally been quite underrepresented.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nWe see continued strength in gaming, I would say much better than typical seasonality. That is really our AIB business with the Radeon products ramping, as well as consoles have now drained all of their inventory. And so they are starting their ramp into the year. And from a data center side, we see sequential growth on the CPU side. We see the GPU right on track minus the China export controls.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd so for all of those reasons, we're pleased with where the performance of the business is right now.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYes. I'll just add one point to what Lisa just said on the client business. We had really strong performance in Q1. Sequentially, client revenue is largely flattish versus Q4. When you look behind it, our unit actually declined double digit.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nSo the revenue flattish is largely driven by the ASP increases sequentially due to the richer mix that Lisa just mentioned.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director - Equity Research)\nThank you for all that color. To follow-up, I wanted to ask about how the X X three zero eight INSTAINT family performed in the quarter and how you're thinking about the back half of the year. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks significant double digit year over year. Could you maybe provide some color on how Instinct did in the first quarter? How you're thinking about the first half ahead of the three fifty ramp next month? Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure. So on the Instinct ramp, I would say a Q1 performance of data center GPU was in line with maybe a little bit better than expected. I think the key point that we've always said about the Instinct ramp is very excited about the MI350 launch. We're right on track for that launching midyear. I would say customer interest has been very high.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo from a competitiveness standpoint, we feel really good about where it's positioned. Overall, I think one of the advantages that we have with the MI350 launch is that from a systems overall environment, it's actually a very similar to the MI300. So we believe it's going to ramp fast. And we already have a couple of deals that have been announced, including a very important relationship with Oracle in terms of the MI350 Series for a number of joint customers. So we're excited about the overall AI business.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI think we continue to see strength there. I know there are some uncertainties as it relates to tariffs and other things, But this is one of those areas where from an infrastructure standpoint, there continues to be investment in AI infrastructure. And so with that, we would expect strong growth into the second half of the year.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Lisa, you said that data center GPU grew significant double digit, but it was like $600,000,000 last March. So I would think that I mean, I think a lot of us thought it was going to be like 1.7 to 1.75. So is that the wrong way to sort of interpret that? Because it seems like it more than it went up triple digits at least.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nSo can you help us there? And also, I'm curious, the additional $800,000,000 that sort of has to come out of from the ban, does that all come out in September? Or is there some remnants of that that have to come out in the fourth quarter as well?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYeah, so again, what I would say is the data center GPU business did perform very well in the first quarter. I think we have to go back and look at what you had for first quarter twenty twenty four. But overall standpoint, it performed right where we would expect. Relative to your conversation as to where does it come out, I would say the vast majority comes out in the September. So think about, Jean mentioned $1,500,000,000 you would see the majority of it in Q2 and Q3 with very little in Q4.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo we had always expected that the fourth quarter because it would be very focused on the MI350 family would be non China revenue and that's how it was planned.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. And then Jean, just on the inventory, it was up a lot. Is that just due to ZT or is there something else happening there? Thanks.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nWell, on the inventory side, we built some inventory primarily to support very strong client and the server ramp and also the second half data center GPU ramp. As you probably know, the lead time is really long to build for the Q3, Q4 ramp. We really need to start wafers right now. That's why the inventory has increased.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I know there's been a lot of focus in your upcoming MI three fifty series, Lisa, but MI four hundred next year is where you potentially close the competitive gap in a big way, right? You're bringing Frontier class model training performance GPU in a rack scale solution. More and more of the challenges has been standing up these RackScale platforms, power, cooling, footprint, networking, connectivity, telemetry, etcetera, right?\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nLots of well telegraphed issues with standing up these RackScale architectures. So as you've shared your MI 400 RackScale solution architecture with customers, what is the AMD team doing to potentially address the ease of these deployments with the MI 400? And just in general, what's been the overall feedback been like on MI-four hundred?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYes, Harlan, thank you for the question. I think, look, we're excited about the MI-three 50 series launch that's coming up, but we are extremely excited as well about the MI400 Series and the roadmap there. I think we've been very active with customers on our roadmap. As you know, this is one of those areas where you absolutely have to be planning many quarters in advance for that. One of the primary reasons we acquired ZT Systems was exactly to address this rack scale architecture.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd so from that standpoint, the closing of the ZT acquisition has been very timely. What we're doing right now is together with our ZT design team as well as our customers' design teams and our own systems design capability, really actively planning what those rack scale systems are going to look like. I would say the MI400 series enthusiasm from customers is high. And there's a lot of activities that are going on right now to ensure that we do in fact learn from some of the, let's call it some of the challenges that have occurred with some of the recent deployments.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nThanks for that. And then I continue to be impressed. Mean, seven consecutive quarters of strong year over year growth in your epic enterprise and on prem traction. Right? You have high thirties, low forties type share of the overall server market and enterprise and on prem.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nYour share is probably in the sort of low 20% range, but significant share momentum. Can you just remind us, like, what has the AMD team done? What have you put in place sort of go to market wise to drive the strong tailwind here? And what has been a very, very tough market segment to crack?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI think there are a couple of things, Harlan. First of all, the strength of the product cannot be under sold, right? At this moment with fifth gen Epic, the overall cloud adoption has been fantastic. And then on the enterprise side, we've really broadened the product portfolio for Turin that includes, let's call it, low core count up through the highest core count and frequency ranges. So that's very helpful.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nBut probably the largest impact has been in go to market. In the go to market space, we have added significant headcount and capability to address end users directly. And with the use cases, think some of the things that we talked about across industries, we're actually learning from each deployment and replicating that across many of the industrial partners. So overall, I think it's been a strong effort on enterprise and we're really still in the very early stages of that. I would say we're still quite underrepresented in enterprise, but with the platform coverage and the processor coverage, I think we feel good about the opportunities.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Aaron Raikers** (Analyst)\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Going back to kind of the data center business and particularly the GPU business, You know, I think last quarter, you had alluded to the fact that that you'd expected the data center revenue to be roughly flat, in the first half of the year. I guess if we were to take out the 700,000,000, impact from China, would the expectation still be flat for the year? Is that a fair assumption?\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nSo, Erin, so you're right. Last time, we did mention the first half data center GPU, it's flattish versus second half. The way to think about what Lisa mentioned is the 1,500,000,000 impact largely will be in Q2 and Q3. And so when you take out $700,000,000 in Q2 and majority in Q3, that is what impact in Q2 and Q3. But remember what Lisa mentioned is that we do see second half weighted as we launch MI three fifty five, we will see significant ramp.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYear over year, we see strong double digit growth of our data center business and the GPU business also.\n\n**Aaron Raikers** (Analyst)\nOkay. And then as a quick follow-up, kind of thinking about the gross margin, obviously, this quarter's guidance reflective of charge that you're taking. Should we assume that in the back half with mixed attributes to be considered that you would see a return to that 54 plus percent gross margin in the second half of the year. Is that a fair assessment?\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYeah. Yeah. Erin, thank you for the question. Yeah, there are a few puts takes on the gross margin. If you think about the Q2, excluding $800,000,000 charge related to the MI308, our gross margin actually is around 54%.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nSo at the company level, right, the mix is less favorable because the client and the gaming business is growing sequentially. But we do have a few drivers to drive the gross margin up. First, as I mentioned earlier, if you look at our client business, the gross margin has been improving because the richer mix of our latest generation product portfolio, that really helps. And also secondly, within data center, when we expand enterprise market share, we do see gross margin improvement. Of course, in addition, MI308 data center GPU gross margin is on the low end of our data center GPU margin.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nSo that also helps us overall. When we think about the second half, actually think the gross margin will improve slightly because data center continues to be very strong growth driver, number one growth driver second half versus the first half, which will be partially offset by continued strength on the client and the gaming side. Hope that answer your question.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nHey, Lisa and others. Thanks for taking my question. Really appreciate it. And Gene, thanks for that helpful answer there. I just wanted to understand your view on system based architectures and whether you feel like you have what you need right now.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nObviously, UA Link 1.0 is coming out. You can use third party providers to kind of do the interconnect. ZT system does do a lot for you in terms of the system architecture, but from the interconnect side, do you think that you need more? Is that something that you're going to do internally, look externally? Just want to understand where you think the portfolio is today and whether you can address system based architectures of what you have today.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, Tom. Absolutely, I think we feel like we have all the pieces required as well as deep partnerships in the ecosystem. And I consider it a system level optimization between CPU, GPU, networking capability, rack scale architecture. I think all of those pieces are things that we are investing in. And we're also partnering with others in the industry who are offering these capabilities.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI think when we look at the architectures that our customers want, our customers are really asking for one that we have a reference architecture that works, but also that we work with them as they want to interchange various pieces, particularly on the networking side. I think there are a couple of different solutions out there. And we are very much focused on ensuring that we interoperate across the spectrum.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nHelpful. And then if we look at the full year, I mean, we'll get the units with the filing, but it looks like there's some material share gains here in the first quarter. When you look at the full year, just to level set us on share gains versus market growth, could you maybe talk about what you see the client business growing as a base level? And then just obviously, it's difficult to kind of predict where share will go. But just any comments on what you're seeing thus far?\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nIs a couple of points of shares kind of what you're seeing in the first quarter as well? We'll get a little more later, but mostly just on the market growth for 2025. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, Tom. So if you're asking about share in the client business, I think that was the conversation. Look, we are very pleased with our client business performance over the last couple of quarters. I think we are seeing unit growth, particularly in desktop, but where we're seeing probably the most growth is overall revenue share. And so it's we're gaining share in the right places, which is in sort of high end notebook and commercial as well as in desktop overall.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo from that standpoint, that's where we think we're going. As we go through the year, I know there's a good amount of conversation about what happens in the macro and what happens with tariffs and does that change things going forward. We are spending quite a bit of time ensuring that we are aligning with our customers, looking at inventory levels, looking at sort of consumption and overall sell through. And we believe that we have a good overall inventory position and there is not, let's call it a tremendous amount of pull ins or other things that are coming into play. And we will continue to be very agile in how we look at that going forward.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nThank you. I had two questions as well. On the first one, just near term, Lisa, did your GPU sales grew sequentially in Q1? How much was MI three zero eight in that number? And if you look at twenty twenty five overall, do you think GPUs can still grow despite this China headwind that you mentioned relative to the $5,000,000,000 plus you did last year?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYes, sure, Vivek. So, let me answer the second question first. We absolutely believe the data center GPU will grow and we think it'll grow strong double digits. We had a plan that was second half weighted, and it still is. Relative to the MI-three zero eight situation, it's certainly a headwind, but one which we think is well contained given everything else that we have going on.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd relative to the Q1 performance of data center GPU, it was down very modestly from Q4, which is what we expected. We did see good overall demand actually in the first quarter driven by MI325. So we had a significant adoption by a large foundational model company, which was very positive there. And as we go forward, we expect that we will continue to broaden both customers as well as workloads within our current customers for Instinct portfolio.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nAnd Vivek, in Q1 MI three twenty five and MI '3 hundred are majority of our revenue.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nGreat. And then longer term, Lisa, you know, the past you described, I believe almost a $500,000,000,000 or so addressable market for AI accelerators. How much of that, you know, roughly is China? Because that now seems to be somewhat restricted for US companies. And then also kind of related to that, how should we think about these AI diffusion rules that I think there is an implementation date that is coming up on May 15.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nI'm curious what you have heard. So just sort of the implication of China restrictions and these AI diffusion rules on thinking about the addressable opportunity for you longer term. Thank you.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nVivek, I think it's a good question. I think overall, it is a very dynamic market. So you'll appreciate that. On the China export controls, I think we always expected that there would be some amount of, let's call it, limitation on sort of leading edge GPUs going into China.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo that was factored in to our TAM expectation when we talked about $500,000,000,000 So I think that dramatically changes the TAM. But what I will say is on the AI diffusion side, what we're very actively working with the government as they're thinking through these rules, and it's a very fine balance that we have to have. At the end of the day, when we look at sort of The US AI companies, we have leading edge technology. We want to ensure that the rest of the world can really use us as the primary platform. So I think it'll be important to work through the AI diffusion rules and all of that as we think about longer term TAM.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd we're certainly spending quite a bit of efforts trying to ensure that it's well understood, the importance of the overall ecosystem and having the rest of the world really adopt The U. S. Ecosystem given our strength and leadership overall.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to revisit your assumptions around client. If you were to just flat line the q one actual, you would grow the business about 30%.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYou're you're obviously very bullish on on taking share. You talked about, huge tailwinds from ASPs. But curious, when you put it all together, how should we think about traditional seasonality into the second half, particularly with, the potential of some pull ins here in the first half?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, CJ. It's a fair question. Look, we want to be very clear that our client business performance is primarily driven by the strength of the product portfolio, and it's driven by some of the desktop channel products that traditionally are not so well tracked, if you look at sort of the IDCs of the world. We are planning for, let's call it, a second half sub seasonal, given that we're off to such a strong start in the first half of the year. And that is what we're putting into our sort of internal planning numbers.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSo you wouldn't see necessarily typical seasonality since the first half is better than seasonal. That being the case, I think we feel strongly that from a consumption basis standpoint, we can see the data. So the when we look at the Q1 performance, it was a very, very strong Q1 in terms of sellout and consumption for our desktop business. And as we start Q2, we're now four weeks into it, we see those patterns continuing. So we're in an upgrade cycle right now.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nGaming CPUs are usually purchased when they're gaming GPUs that come out in new cycles. And I think we're benefiting from that on both the CPU and the GPU side, which is great. I mean, we're very happy with that and we're ramping up production to ensure that we keep the channel full.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. And then I guess looking to next year, can you talk about 400 series and rack level solution go to market strategy? You talked about kind of trying to obtain partners. Is there a certain number that you're targeting? And then how are you thinking about kind of getting through some of the learning curve challenges of getting the rack scale working with your OEM partners such that you can deliver that ramp in 2026? Thanks so much.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, CJ. So I think the right answer is we're getting a very early start and that's what we have to do is so that we maximize the overall learning cycle that is required for RackScale solutions. We are working very closely with a number of our hyperscale partners today to define those solutions and make sure that we're thinking about all of the various areas that could require work. And we're also working with our OEM partners who also have, let's call it, learned quite a bit over the past couple of months and quarters as other RackScale solutions have been coming online. So I think we're doing everything to, let's call it, move ahead the learning cycle.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd again, we have the benefit of the MI350 series being a relatively, let's call it, not large lift. And so the focus on the RAC scale stuff is on MI400.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, given the China Data Center GPU headwinds in Q2 and Q3, do you think that GPU business actually grows year over year in Q2 and Q3? Understanding your comments for the full year on it, but do you think given those headwinds in Q2 and Q3, it can actually grow year over year?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI think you're let's see, Stacy, the best way to answer that question is, in Q2, it's not going to grow year over year, just given what we've said about the $700,000,000 coming out of Q2 and how we had previously talked about the evolution. But we do believe that we'll grow year over year going forward in Q3 and Q4, certainly for us to do the full year with strong double digit growth.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nOkay. So you do think it can grow year over year in Q3. Okay. For my second question, I wanted to ask about kind of the trends in in q one. So you said it was data center GPU was down, I guess, modestly in q one as expected.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nBut again, I go back to your sort of double digit year over year comments, I mean, it it couldn't have been any more than, 1,400,000,000 in q one for these two b and feels like it's less than that, which means it would have been down at least 20% sequentially, maybe more, which also implies that the server CPUs in Q1 were up sequentially, which is also well above seasonal similar to clients. I guess what I'm asking is, are those trends correct? Am I modeling that correct? And I guess, what are the implications in that case of server CPUs actually up well above seasonal in Q1 given this environment?\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nI think Stacy, this is Jean. I think when you think about the Q1 data center performance, it's declined 5%. So it's a little bit better from a server perspective because it is declined sequentially. Same thing like this on the GPU, like Lisa mentioned earlier, is a decline. So I think that is the overall data center performance.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nI think I don't know about your model, but that is how we really look at the numbers, how we think about it.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. I'm going to go to the Embedded space. I know it's not the biggest one, but everything else has been addressed pretty detailed. You mentioned the second half getting up to year over year growth. Seems like that requires some significant double digit growth sequentially in both quarters just to get the full half there. What gives you the confidence in that sort of ramp?\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYes. Ross, thank you for the question. On the embedded side, we started to see gradual recovery. I think there are signs, especially the order pattern, the book to bill ratios, we see improving in the, like aerospace defense and also test and measurement side, we see very visible improvement. Industrial side, the improvement is less so their inventory still among different customers.\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nBut overall, the trend, the demand pattern does improve. I think Q2, we did guided sequentially flattish. And I think we'll start to see Q3, especially Q4, you will see year over year increase, especially in Q4.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Analyst)\nOkay. Thanks for that. And I guess as my last question, on the OpEx side of things, guided to the overt number for the second quarter, '2 point '3 billion. You said there's $50,000,000 from ZTE in there. Is that the entirety of the ZT side of things?\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Analyst)\nOr what should we think for kind of full year OpEx or the second half, however you want to discuss it?\n\n**Jean Hu** (Executive VP, CFO &amp; Treasurer)\nYes, Ross, thank you for the question. For the ZT design team, we view it quarterly, the incremental OpEx is about $50,000,000 that $2,300,000,000 include everything from ZT because we closed the transaction on March 31. I think when you look at the overall, our OpEx increase year over year, we continue to drive revenue growth to increase more than OpEx. Looking at the Q2 at the middle point of our guidance, the revenue will be increasing 27% and we do expect the earnings per share growing much faster than the top line revenue growth. So OpEx side, we'll be very disciplined to continue to manage it.\n\n**Matt Ramsay** (Corporate VP - Financial Strategy &amp; IR)\nOperator, I think we have time for one more caller, please. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nNo problem. And the final question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you. One of the things your cloud customers have been talking about is this kind of growth in inference costs, this sort of reasoning models using a lot of inference compute and some tightness. Can you talk about that from AMD's perspective? Are you seeing that in your business?\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Analyst)\nDoes that change the focus that you have going forward?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nSure, Joe. So I think overall, what we're seeing is that with these new reasoning models, the inferencing is more important and there's also a move to more distributed inferencing. So I think that plays into our strengths. I think we have demonstrated with MI 300 that we are an excellent inference solution and that holds true for three fifty and three fifty series as well. So we continue to see with our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages, that's a positive.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nI will say that as we're going into this, the number of workloads that we're seeing overall is expanding. So we're seeing both training and inferencing as important workloads that we're working on. And our customers continue to demonstrate. I think the desire that we're seeing probably from a trend standpoint is that there are many models that people are using today. So they're not necessarily using one model, they're actually using several different models.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd so the optimizations around that are the things that we're doing with our ROCCOM software suite.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Analyst)\nGreat. And then just an update on your thoughts on competing with custom silicon with ASICs in AI space. Most of your largest customers also have a custom silicon offering. So will they invest in both AMD and ASICs? And just how do they decide how to apportion that investment?\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nYes. I mean, Joe, I view them as really two different things. I think one of the primary aspects, as we've talked about the $500,000,000,000 TAM and the opportunities there, look, we think ASICs have a place. We happen to think GPUs have a larger piece of that because the models are changing so much. And from our standpoint, it's really important to have competitive TCO.\n\n**Lisa Su** (Chair &amp; CEO)\nAnd people want choice to get there, especially as inference costs become so important. And we're working on trying to expand the overall inferencing capability out there. So I don't think it's an either or. I think it's a let's get the best solutions out there and we will certainly believe that we're very competitive in inferencing. And I think we are also becoming a much more sort of solution for training as well.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question and answer session. And that also concludes today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
