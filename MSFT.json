      "content": "**Operator**\n...Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2026 second quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Nielsen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThey are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nYou can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you very much, Jonathan. This quarter, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, up 26% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our platform and accelerating demand. We are in the beginning phases of AI diffusion and its broad GDP impact. Our TAM will grow substantially across every layer of the tech stack as this diffusion accelerates and spreads. In fact, even in this early innings, we have built an AI business that is larger than some of our biggest franchises that took decades to build. Today, I'll focus my remarks across the three layers of our stack: cloud and token factory, AI and platform, and high-value agentic experiences. When it comes to our cloud and token factory, the key to long-term competitiveness is shaping our infrastructure to support new high-scale workloads.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe are building this infrastructure out for the heterogeneous and distributed nature of these workloads, ensuring the right fit with the geographic and segment-specific needs for all customers, including the long tail. The key metric we are optimizing for is tokens per watt per dollar, which comes down to increasing utilization and decreasing TCO using silicon systems and software. A good example of this is the 50% increase in throughput we were able to achieve in one of our highest volume workloads, OpenAI inferencing, powering our copilots. Another example was the unlocking of new capabilities and efficiencies for our Fairwater data centers. In this instance, we connected both Atlanta and Wisconsin site through an AI WAN to build a first-of-its-kind AI super factory. Fairwater's two-story design and liquid cooling allow us to run higher GPU densities and thereby improve both performance and latencies for high-scale training.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAll up, we added nearly 1 GW of total capacity this quarter alone. At the silicon layer, we have NVIDIA and AMD and our own Maia chips, delivering the best all-up fleet performance, cost, and supply across multiple generations of hardware. Earlier this week, we brought online our Maia 200 accelerator. Maia 200 delivers 10+ petaflops at FP4 precision with over 30% improved TCO compared to the latest generation hardware in our fleet. We will be scaling this, starting with inferencing and synthetic data gen for our super intelligence team, as well as doing inferencing for Copilot and Foundry. And given AI workloads are not just about AI accelerators, but also consume large amounts of compute, we are pleased with the progress we are making on the CPU side as well.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nCobalt 200 is another big leap forward, delivering over 50% higher performance compared to our first custom-built processor for cloud-native workloads. Sovereignty is increasingly top of mind for customers, and we are expanding our solutions and global footprint to match. We announced DC investments in seven countries this quarter alone, supporting local data residency needs. We offer the most comprehensive set of sovereignty solutions across public, private, and national partner clouds, so customers can choose the right approach for each workload with the local control they require. Next, I want to talk about the agent platform. Like in every platform shift, all software is being rewritten. A new app platform is being born.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou can think of agents as the new apps, and to build, deploy, and manage agents, customers will need a model catalog, tuning services, harness for orchestration, services for context engineering, AI safety, management, observability, and security. It starts with having broad model choice. Our customers expect to use multiple models as part of any workload that they can fine-tune and optimize based on cost, latency, and performance requirements. We offer the broadest selection of models of any hyperscaler. This quarter, we added support for GPT-5 too, as well as Claude 4.5. Already, over 1,500 customers have used both Anthropic and OpenAI models on Foundry. We are seeing increasing demand for region-specific models, including Mistral and Cohere, as more customers look for sovereign AI choices.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe continue to invest in our first-party models, which are optimized to address the highest value customer scenarios, such as productivity, coding, and security. As part of Foundry, we also give customers the ability to customize and fine-tune models. Increasingly, customers want to be able to capture the tacit knowledge they possess inside of model weights as their core IP. This is probably the most important sovereign consideration for firms as AI diffuses more broadly across our GDP, and every firm needs to protect their enterprise value. For agents to be effective, they need to be grounded in enterprise data and knowledge. That means connecting their agents to systems of record and operational data, analytical data, as well as semi-structured and unstructured productivity and communications data. And this is what we are doing with our Unified IQ layer, spanning Fabric, Foundry, and data powering Microsoft 365.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIn the world of context engineering, Foundry Knowledge and Fabric are gaining momentum. Foundry Knowledge delivers better context with automated source routing and advanced agentic retrieval while respecting user permissions. Fabric brings together end-to-end operational, real-time, and analytical data. Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion, with over 31,000 customers, and it continues to be the fastest-growing analytics platform on the market, with revenue up 60% year-over-year. All up, the number of customers spending $1 million plus per quarter on Foundry grew nearly 80%, driven by strong growth in every industry. Over 250 customers are on track to process over 1 trillion tokens on Foundry this year. There are many great examples of customers using all of this capability on Foundry to build their own agentic systems.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAlaska Airlines is creating natural language flight search, BMW is speeding up design cycles, Land O'Lakes is enabling precision farming for co-op members, and SymphonyAI is addressing bottlenecks in the CPG industry. And of course, Foundry remains a powerful on-ramp for the entire cloud. The vast majority of Foundry customers use additional Azure solutions like developer services, app services, databases as they scale. Beyond Fabric and Foundry, we are also addressing agent building by knowledge workers with Copilot Studio and Agent Builder. Over 80% of the Fortune 500 have active agents built using these low-code, no-code tools. As agents proliferate, every customer will need new ways to deploy, manage, and protect them. We believe this creates a major new category and significant growth opportunity for us.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThis quarter, we introduced Agent 365, which makes it easy for organizations to extend their existing governance, identity, security, and management to agents. That means the same controls they already use across Microsoft 365 and Azure now extend to agents they build and deploy on our cloud or any other cloud. And partners like Adobe, Databricks, Genspark, Glean, NVIDIA, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday are already integrating Agent 365. We are the first provider to offer this type of agent control plane across clouds. Now, let's turn to the high-value agentic experiences we are building. AI experiences are intent-driven and are beginning to work at task scope. We are entering an age of macro delegation and micro steering across domains. Intelligence using multiple models is built into multiple form factors.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou see this in chat, in new agent inbox apps, coworker scaffoldings, agent workflows embedded in applications and IDEs that are used every day, or even in our command line with file system access and skills. That's the approach we are taking with our first-party family of Copilot spanning key domains. In consumer, for example, Copilot experiences span chat, news, feed, search, creation, browsing, shopping, and integrations into the operating system, and it's gaining momentum. Daily users of our Copilot app increased nearly 3x year-over-year, and with Copilot Checkout, we have partnered with PayPal, Shopify, and Stripe so customers can make purchases directly within the app.... With Microsoft 365 Copilot, we are focused on organization-wide productivity. Work IQ takes the data underneath Microsoft 365 and creates the most valuable stateful agent for every organization.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt delivers powerful reasoning capabilities over people, their roles, their artifacts, their communications, and their history and memory, all within an organization's security boundary. Microsoft 365 Copilot's accuracy and latency, powered by Work IQ, is unmatched, delivering faster and more accurate work-grounded results than competition. We have seen our biggest quarter-over-quarter improvement in response quality to date. This has driven record usage intensity, with average number of conversations per user doubling year-over-year. Microsoft 365 Copilot also is becoming true daily habit, with daily active users increasing 10x year-over-year. We are also seeing strong momentum with Researcher Agent, which supports both OpenAI and Claude, as well as agent mode in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. All up, it was a record quarter for Microsoft 365 Copilot seat adds, up over 160% year-over-year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe saw accelerating seat growth quarter-over-quarter, and now have 15 million paid Microsoft 365 Copilot seats and multiples more enterprise chat users. We are seeing larger commercial deployments. The number of customers with over 35,000 seats tripled year-over-year. Fiserv, ING, NASA, University of Kentucky, University of Manchester, US Department of Interior, and Westpac all purchased over 35,000 seats. Publicis alone purchased over 95,000 seats for nearly all its employees. We are also taking share in Dynamics 365 with built-in agents across the entire suite. A great example of this is how Visa is turning customer conversations data into knowledge articles with our Customer Knowledge Management Agent in Dynamics, and how Sandvik is using our Sales Qualification Agent to automate lead qualification across tens and thousands of potential customers. In coding, we are seeing strong growth across all paid GitHub Copilot.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nCopilot Pro plus subs for individual devs increased 77% quarter-over-quarter, and all up now, we have 4.7 million paid Copilot subscribers, up 75% year-over-year. Siemens, for example, is going all in on GitHub, adopting the full platform to increase developer productivity after a successful Copilot rollout to 30,000+ developers. GitHub Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agents like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI in the context of customers' GitHub repos. With Copilot CLI and VS Code, we offer developers the full spectrum of form factors and models they need for AI-first coding workflows. And when you add Work IQ as a skill or an MCP to our developer workflow, it's a game changer, surfacing more context like emails, meetings, docs, projects, messages, and more.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou can simply ask the agent to plan and execute changes to your code base based on an update to a spec in SharePoint or using the transcript of your last engineering and design meeting in Teams. We are going beyond that with GitHub Copilot SDK. Developers can now embed the same runtime behind Copilot CLI, multi-model, multi-step planning tools, MCP integration, auth, streaming directly into their applications. In security, we added a dozen new and updated Security Copilot agents across Defender, Entra, Intune, and Purview. For example, Icertis's SOC team used Security Copilot agent to reduce manual triage time by 75%, which is a real game changer in an industry facing a severe talent shortage.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nTo make it easier for security teams to onboard, we are rolling out Security Copilot to all our E5 customers, and our security solutions are also becoming essential to manage organizations' AI deployments. 24 billion Copilot interactions were audited by Purview this quarter, up 9x year-over-year. Finally, I want to talk about two additional high-impact agentic experiences. First, in healthcare, Dragon Copilot is the leader in its category, helping over 100,000 medical providers automate their workflows. Mount Sinai Health is now moving to a system-wide Dragon Copilot deployment for providers after a successful trial with its primary care physicians. All up, we helped document 21 million patient encounters this quarter, up 3x year-over-year. And second, when it comes to science and engineering, companies like Unilever in consumer goods and Synopsys in EDA are using Microsoft Discovery to orchestrate specialized agents for R&D end-to-end.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThey're able to reason over scientific literature and internal knowledge, formulate hypotheses, spin up simulations, and continuously iterate to drive new discoveries. Beyond AI, we continue to invest in all our core franchises and meet the needs of our customers and partners, and we are seeing strong progress. For example, when it comes to cloud migrations, our new SQL Server has over 2x the IaaS adoption of the previous version. In security, we now have 1.6 million security customers, including over 1 million who use four or more of our workloads. Windows reached a big milestone, 1 billion Windows 11 users, up over 45% year-over-year. We had share gains this quarter across Windows, Edge, and Bing.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nDouble-digit member growth in LinkedIn with 30% growth in paid video ads. In gaming, we are committed to delivering great games across Xbox, PC, Cloud, and every other device, and we saw record PC players and paid streaming hours on Xbox. In closing, we feel very good about how we are delivering for customers today and building the full stack to capture the opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. With growing demand for our offerings and focused execution by our sales teams, we again exceeded expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share while investing to fuel long-term growth. This quarter, revenue was $81.3 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 14% in constant currency, while operating income increased 21% and 19% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $4.14, an increase of 24% and 21% in constant currency when adjusted for the impact from our investment in OpenAI. FX increased reported results slightly less than expected, particularly in Intelligent Cloud revenue.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCompany gross margin percentage was 68%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily driven by continued investments in AI infrastructure and growing AI product usage that was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial Cloud, as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by R&D investments in compute capacity and AI talent, as well as impairment charges in our gaming business. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 47% ahead of expectations. As a reminder, we still account for our investment in OpenAI under the equity method, and as a result of OpenAI's recapitalization, we now record gains or losses based on our share of the change in their net assets on their balance sheet, as opposed to our share of their operating profit or losses from their income statement.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nTherefore, we recorded a gain which drove other income and expense to $10 billion in our GAAP results. When adjusted for the OpenAI impact, other income and expense was slightly negative and lower than expected, driven by net losses on investments. Capital expenditures were $37.5 billion, and this quarter, roughly two-thirds of our CapEx was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs. Our customer demand continues to exceed our supply. Therefore, we must balance the need to have our incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand with expanding first-party AI usage across services like M365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, increasing allocations to R&D teams to accelerate product innovation, and continued replacement of end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThis quarter, total finance leases were $6.7 billion and were primarily for large data center sites, and cash paid for PP&E was $29.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $35.8 billion, up 60%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion and decreased sequentially, reflecting the higher cash capital expenditures from a lower mix of finance leases. Finally, we returned $12.7 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases, an increase of 32% year-over-year. Now to our commercial results.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCommercial bookings increased 230% and 228% in constant currency, driven by the previously announced large Azure commitment from OpenAI that reflects multiyear demand needs, as well as the previously announced Anthropic commitment from November and healthy growth across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation, which continues to be reported net of reserves, increased to $625 billion and was up 110% year-over-year, with a weighted average duration of approximately 2.5 years. Roughly 25% will be recognized in revenue in the next twelve months, up 39% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next twelve months, increased 156%. Approximately 45% of our commercial RPO balance is from OpenAI.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe significant remaining balance grew 28% and reflects ongoing broad customer demand across the portfolio. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $51.5 billion and grew 26% and 24% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 67% and down year over year due to continued investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $34.1 billion and grew 16% and 14% in constant currency. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, with consistent execution in the core business and increasing contribution from strong Copilot results.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nARPU growth was again led by E5 and M365 Copilot, and paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year to over 450 million, with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 13% and 10% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 29% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth…. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 6%. LinkedIn revenue increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, driven by marketing solutions. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 17% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased, again, driven by efficiency gains at M365 Commercial Cloud that were partially offset by continued investments in AI, including the impact of growing Copilot usage. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 22% and 19% in constant currency. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 60%, driven by improved operating leverage, as well as the higher gross margins noted earlier. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $32.9 billion and grew 29% and 28% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, with ongoing efficiency gains across our fungible fleet, enabling us to reallocate some capacity to Azure that was monetized in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, we continued to see strong demand across workloads, customer segments, and geographic regions, and demand continues to exceed available supply. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, including a benefit from the launch of SQL Server 2025, as well as higher transactional purchasing ahead of memory price increases. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year, driven by continued investments in AI and sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nOperating expenses increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, and operating income grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. Operating margins were 42%, down slightly year-over-year, as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.3 billion and declined 3%. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Windows OEM grew 5% with strong execution, as well as a continued benefit from Windows 10 end of support. Results were ahead of expectations as inventory levels remained elevated, with increased purchasing ahead of memory price increases. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly below expectations, driven by some execution challenges. As expected, the sequential growth rate moderated as the benefit from third-party partnerships normalized.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn gaming, revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency and was below expectations, driven by first-party content with impact across the platform. Segment gross margin dollars increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, driven by the impairment charges in our gaming business noted earlier, as well as R&D investments in compute capacity and AI talent. Operating income decreased 3% and 4% in constant currency, and operating margins were relatively unchanged year-over-year at 27%, as higher operating expenses were mostly offset by higher gross margins. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nBased on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by three points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by four points in Productivity and Business Processes and two points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by two points. As a reminder, this impact is due to the exchange rates a year ago. Starting with the total company, we expect revenue of $80.65 billion-$81.75 billion, or growth of 15%-17%, with continued strong growth across our commercial businesses, partially offset by our consumer businesses.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWe expect COGS of $26.65 billion-$26.85 billion, or growth of 22%-23%, and operating expense of $17.8 billion-$17.9 billion, or growth of 10%-11%, driven by continued investment in R&D, AI compute capacity, and talent against a low prior year comparable. Operating margins should be down slightly year-over-year. Excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense is expected to be roughly $700 million, driven by a fair market gain in our equity portfolio and interest income, partially offset by interest expense, which includes the interest payments related to data center finance leases. We expect our adjusted Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nNext, we expect capital expenditures to decrease on a sequential basis due to the normal variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. As we work to close the gap between demand and supply, we expect the mix of short-lived assets to remain similar to Q2. Now, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a growing ex-pre base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. As a reminder, the significant OpenAI contract signed in Q2 represents multiyear demand needs from them, which will result in some quarterly volatility in both bookings and RPO growth rates going forward. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 65%, down year-over-year, driven by continued investments in AI. Now to segment guidance.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $34.25 billion-$34.55 billion, or growth of 14%-15%. In M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13%-14% in constant currency, with continued stability in year-over-year growth rates on a large and expanding base. Accelerating Copilot momentum and ongoing E5 adoption will again drive ARPU growth. M365 Commercial Products revenue should decline in the low single digits, down sequentially, assuming Office 2024 transactional purchasing trends normalize. As a reminder, M365 Commercial Products include components that can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid- to high-20% range, driven by growth at ARPU, as well as continued subscription volume.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nFor LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth to be in the low double digits, and in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens, with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $34.1 billion-$34.4 billion, or growth of 27%-29%. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 37% and 38% in constant currency against a prior year comparable that included significantly accelerating growth rates in both Q3 and Q4. As mentioned earlier, demand continues to exceed supply, and we will need to continue to balance the incoming supply we can allocate here against other priorities.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAs a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as growth rates normalize following the launch of SQL Server 2025. Though increased memory pricing could create additional volatility in transactional purchasing. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.3 billion-$12.8 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low teens. Growth rates will be impacted as the benefit from Windows 10 end of support normalizes and as elevated inventory levels come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline roughly 10%.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal, in part due to the potential impact on the PC market from increased memory pricing. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high single digits. Even as we work to improve execution, we expect continued share gains across Bing and Edge, with growth driven by volume, and we expect sequential growth moderation as the contribution from third-party partnerships continues to normalize. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited from strong content performance, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass, and hardware revenue should decline year-over-year. Now, some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nBased on current rates, we expect FX to increase Q4 total revenue and COGS growth by less than 1 point, with no impact to operating expense growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 1 point in Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing and less than 1 point in Intelligent Cloud. With the strong work delivered in H1 to prioritize investment in key growth areas and the favorable impact from a higher mix of revenue in our Windows OEM and commercial on-prem businesses, we now expect FY 2026 operating margins to be up slightly. We mentioned the potential impact on Windows OEM and on-premises server markets from increased memory pricing earlier. In addition, rising memory prices would impact capital expenditures, though the impact on Microsoft Cloud gross margins will build more gradually as these assets depreciate over six years.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn closing, we delivered strong top-line growth in H1 and are investing across every layer of the stack to continue to deliver high-value solutions and tools to our customers. With that, let's go to Q&A. Jonathan?\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Analyst)\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. I'm looking at a Microsoft print where earnings is growing 24% year-on-year, which is a spectacular result. Great execution on your part. Top line growing well, margins expanding. But I'm looking at after-hours trading, and the stock is still down. And I think one of the core issues that is weighing on investors is CapEx is growing faster than we expected, and maybe Azure is growing a little bit slower than we expected. And I think that fundamentally comes down to a concern on the ROI on this CapEx spend over time. So I was hoping you guys could help us fill in some of the blanks a little bit in terms of how should we think about capacity expansion and what that can yield in terms of Azure growth going forward?\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Analyst)\nMore to the point, how should we think about the ROI on this investment as it comes to fruition? Thanks, guys.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\n... Thanks, Keith. And let me start, and Satya can add some broader comments, I'm sure. I think the first thing, I think you really asked a very direct correlation that I do think many investors are doing, which is between the CapEx spend and seeing an Azure revenue number. And, you know, we tried last quarter, and I think again this quarter, to talk more specifically about all the places that the CapEx spend, especially the short-lived CapEx spend across CPU and GPU, and where that'll show up. Sometimes I think it's probably better to think about the Azure guidance that we give as an allocated capacity guide about what we can deliver in Azure revenue. Because as we spend the capital and put GPUs specifically, it applies to CPUs, but GPUs more specifically, we're really making long-term decisions.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe first thing we're doing is solving for the increased usage in sales and the accelerating pace of M365 Copilot, as well as GitHub Copilot, our first-party apps. Then we make sure we're investing in the long-term nature of R&D and product innovation. And much of the acceleration that I think you've seen from us in products over the past bit is coming because we are allocating GPUs and capacity to many of the talented AI people we've been hiring over the past years. You end up with the remainder going towards serving the Azure capacity that continues to grow in terms of demand.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nA way to think about it, because I think I get asked this question sometimes, is, you know, if I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2, in terms of GPUs, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40. And I think the most important thing to realize is that this is about investing in all the layers of the stack that benefit customers, and I think that's hopefully helpful in terms of thinking about capital growth. It shows in every piece. It shows in revenue growth across the business and shows as OpEx growth as we invest in our people.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, I think you, Amy, covered it. But basically, as an investor, I think when you think about our capital, and you think about the GM profile of our portfolio, you should obviously think about Azure, but you should think about M365 Copilot, and you should think about GitHub Copilot. You should think about Dragon Copilot, Security Copilot. All of those have a GM profile and lifetime value. I mean, if you think about it, acquiring an Azure customer is super important to us, but so is acquiring an M365 or a GitHub or a Dragon Copilot, which are all, by the way, incremental businesses and TAMs for us. And so we don't want to maximize just one business of ours.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe want to be able to allocate capacity while we're sort of supply constrained in a way that allows us to essentially build the best LTV portfolio. That's on one side, and the other one that Amy mentioned is also R&D. I mean, you got to think about compute is also R&D, and that's sort of the second element of it. And so we're using all of that, obviously, to optimize for the long term.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Analyst)\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (Analyst)\nThank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. One of the other questions we believe investors want to understand is how to think about your line of sight from hardware CapEx investment to revenue and margins. You capitalize servers over six years, but the average duration of your RPO is 2.5 years, up from two years last quarter. How do investors get comfortable that since this is a lot of this CapEx is AI-centric, that you'll be able to capture sufficient revenue over the 6-year useful life of the hardware to deliver solid revenue and gross profit dollars growth? Hopefully, one similar to the CPU revenue. Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThanks, Mark. Let me start with at a high level, and Satya can add as well. I think, you know, when you think about average duration, I think what you're getting to is, and we need to remember, is that average duration is a combination of a broad set of contract arrangements that we have. A lot of them around things like M365 or our BizApp portfolio are shorter dated, right? Three-year contracts, and so they have, quite frankly, a short duration. The majority then, that's remaining are Azure contracts that are longer duration, and you saw that this quarter when we saw the extension of that duration from around 2 years to 2.5.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe way to think about that is, you know, the majority of the capital that we're spending today, and a lot of the GPUs that we're buying, are already contracted for most of their useful life. So a way to think about that is, you know, much of that risk that I think you're pointing to isn't there because they're already sold for the entirety of their useful life. So part of it exists because you have this shorter dated RPO because of some of the M365 stuff. If you look at the Azure-only RPO, it's a little bit more extended. A lot of that is CPU basis. It's not just GPU.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nOn the GPU contracts that we've talked about, including for some of our largest customers, those are sold for the entire useful life of the GPU, and so there's not the risk to which I think you may be referring. Hopefully, that's helpful.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\n... Yeah, and just one other thing I would add, to it is, in addition to sort of what Amy mentioned, which is it's already contracted for the useful life, is we do use software to continuously run even the latest models on, the fleet, that is aging, if you will. So that's sort of what gives us that duration. And so, at the end of the day, we want to have— That's why we even think about aging the fleet constantly, right? So it's not about buying a whole lot of gear one year. It's about each year you ride the Moore's Law, you add, you use software, and then you optimize across all of it.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAnd Mark, maybe to state this, in case it's not obvious, is that as you go through the useful life, actually, you get more and more and more efficient at its delivery. So where you've sold the entirety of its life, the margins actually improve with time. And so I think that may be a good reminder to people as we see that, obviously, in the CPU fleet all the time.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (Analyst)\nThat's a great answer. I really appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please, please proceed.\n\n**Brent Thill** (Analyst)\nThanks, Amy. On 45% of the backlog being related to OpenAI, I'm just curious if you can comment. There's obviously concern about the, you know, the durability, and I know maybe there's not much you can say on this, but I think everyone's concerned about the exposure and if you could maybe talk through your perspective on what both you and Satya are seeing.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI think maybe I would have thought about the question quite differently, Brent. The first thing to focus on is the reason we talked about that number is because 55% or roughly $350 billion is related to the breadth of our portfolio, a breadth of customers across solutions, across Azure, across industries, across geographies. That is a significant RPO balance, larger than most peers, more diversified than most peers, and frankly, I think we have super high confidence in it. When you think about that portion alone growing 28%, it's really impressive work on the breadth as well as the adoption curve that we're seeing, which is I think what I get asked most frequently. It's grown by customer segment, by industry, and by geo, and so it's very consistent.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIf you're asking me about how do I feel about OpenAI and the contract and the health, listen, it's a great partnership. We continue to be their provider of scale. We're excited to do that. We sit under one of the most successful businesses built, and we continue to feel quite good about that. It's allowed us to remain a leader in terms of what we're building and being on the cutting edge of app innovation.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Analyst)\nOkay, thank you very much. Satya, Amy, regardless of how you allocate the capacity between first party and third party, can you comment qualitatively on the amount of capacity that you have coming on? I think the 1 GW added in the December quarter was extraordinary and hints that the capacity adds are accelerating. But I think a lot of investors have their eyes on Fairwater, Atlanta, Fairwater, Wisconsin, and would love some comments about the magnitude of the capacity adds, regardless of how they're allocated in the coming quarters. Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nYeah, Karl, I think we've said a couple of things. We're working as hard as we can to add capacity as quickly as we can. You've mentioned specific sites like Atlanta or Wisconsin. Those are multi-year deliveries, so I wouldn't focus necessarily on specific locations. The real thing we've got to do, and we're working incredibly hard at doing it, is adding capacity globally. A lot of that will be added in the United States, the two locations you've mentioned, but it also needs to be added across the globe to meet the customer demand that we're seeing and the increased usage. You know, we'll continue to add both long-lived assets, infrastructure.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe way to think about that is we need to make sure we've got power and land and facilities available, and we'll continue to put GPUs and CPUs in them when they're done, as quickly as we can. And then finally, we'll try to make sure we can get as efficient as we possibly can on the pace at which we do that and how we operate them so that they can have the highest possible utility. And so I think, it's not really about, you know, two places, Karl. I, I would definitely abstract away from that. Those are multi-year delivery timelines, but really, we just need to get it done every location where we're currently in a build or, or starting to do that. We're working as quickly as we can.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Analyst)\nOkay, got it. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (Analyst)\nThank you so much. Satya, the performance achievements of the Maia 200 accelerator for inference looked quite remarkable, especially in comparison to TPUs and Trainium and Blackwell, which have just been around a lot longer. Can, can you put that accomplishment in perspective, in terms of how much of a core competency you think silicon might become for Microsoft? And Amy, are there any ramifications worth mentioning there in terms of supporting your gross margin profile for inference costs going forward?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, no, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. One is we've been at this, in a variety of different forms, for a long, long time in terms of building our own silicon. And, so we're very, very thrilled about the progress with Maia 200. And, you know, especially when we think about running a GPT-5 too and the, the performance we're able to get in the GEMMs, at FP4, just proves the point that, when you have, a new workload, a new shape of a workload, you can start innovating end-to-end, between the model and, and, and the silicon. And the entire system is just not even about just the silicon, the way, the networking works at, at rack scale that's optimized, with memory for, this particular workload.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThe other thing is we are obviously round-tripping and working very closely with our own super intelligence team with all of our models. As you can imagine, whatever we build will be all optimized for Maia. We feel great about it, and I think the way to think about all up is we're in such early innings. I mean, even just look at the amount of silicon innovation and systems innovation. Even since December, I think the new thing is everybody's talking about low latency inference. Right? One of the things we want to make sure is we're not locked into any one thing. If anything, we have great partnership with NVIDIA, with AMD. They're innovating, we're innovating. We want to fleet at any given point in time to have access to the best TCO.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAnd it's not a one-generation game. I think a lot of folks just talk about who's ahead. It's just remember, you have to be ahead all the—for all time to come. And that means you really want to think about, you know, having a lot of innovation that happens out there to be in your fleet so that your fleet is fundamentally advantaged at the TCO level. So that's kind of how I look at it, which is we are excited about Maia, we're excited about Cobalt, we're excited about DPU, our next. So we have a lot of systems capability. That means we can vertically integrate, and because we can vertically integrate doesn't mean we just only vertically integrate. And so we want to be able to have the flexibility here, and that's what you see us do.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you very much. Satya, we heard a lot about frontier transformations from Judson at Ignite, and we've seen customers realize breakthrough benefits when they adopt the Microsoft AI stack. Can you help frame for us the momentum in enterprises embarking on these journeys, and any expectation for how much their spend with Microsoft can expand in becoming frontier firms? Thanks.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, thank you for that. So I think, one of the things that we are seeing, is the adoption across the three major suites of ours, right? So if you take M365, you take, what's happening with security, and you take GitHub. In fact, it's, it's fascinating. I mean, you know, these three things had effectively compounding effects for our customers in the past, like something like Entra as an identity system or Defender as the protection system, across all three was sort of super helpful. But so what now you're seeing is something like Work IQ, right? So, I mean, just to give you a flavor for it, the most important database underneath, for any company that uses Microsoft today is the data underneath Microsoft 365, and the reason is because it has all this tacit information, right? Who are your people?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWhat are their relationships? What are the projects they're working on? What are their artifacts, their communications? So that's a super important asset for any business process, business workflow context. In fact, the scenario I even had in my transcript around, you can now take Work IQ as an MCP server and, you know, GitHub repo and say, \"Hey, please look at my design meetings for the last month in Teams and tell me if my repo reflects it.\" I mean, that's a pretty high-level way to think about how what is happening previously, perhaps with our tools business and our GitHub business, are suddenly now being transformative, right? That agentic plane is really transforming companies in some sense, right? That's, I think, the most magical thing, which is you deploy these things, and suddenly the agents are helping you coordinate, bring more leverage to your enterprise.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThen on top of it, of course, there is the transformation, which is what businesses are doing. How should we think about customer service? How should we think about marketing? How should we think about finance? How should we think about that and build our own agents? That's where all the services in Fabric and Foundry, and of course, the GitHub tooling is helping them, or even the low-code, no-code tools. I had some stats on how much that's being used. But one of the more exciting things for me is these new agents systems, M365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot, all coming together to compound the benefits of all the data and all the deployment. I think is probably the most transformative effect right now.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Analyst)\nThank you. Very helpful.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Operator**\nThe last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Analyst)\n... Perfect. Thanks for squeezing me in. The last few quarters, we talked, besides the GPU side, we talked about CPU as well on the Azure side, and you had some operational changes at the beginning, or January last year. Can you speak what you saw there, and maybe put it more in a bigger picture in terms of clients realizing that their move to the cloud is important if they want to deliver proper AI? So, what are we seeing in terms of cloud transitions? Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nI didn't quite-\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nSorry, Raimo, you were asking about the SMC, CPU side, or can you just repeat the question, please?\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Analyst)\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yes, sorry. So I was wondering about the CPU side of Azure, because we had some operational changes there. You know, we also hear from the field a lot that people are realizing they need to be in the cloud if they want to do proper AI, and if that's kind of driving momentum. Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, I think I get it. So first of all, I had mentioned in my remarks that when you think about AI workloads, you shouldn't think of AI workloads as just AI accelerator compute, right? Because in some sense, it takes any agent, the agent will then spawn through tool use maybe a container, which runs obviously on compute. In fact, we have whenever we think about even the building out of the fleet, we think of in ratios. Even for a training job, by the way, an AI training job requires a bunch of compute and a bunch of storage, very close to compute, and so therefore, and in same thing in inferencing as well. So in inferencing with agent mode, would require you to essentially provision a computer, or computing resources to the agent.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThey don't need GPUs. They're running on GPUs, but they need computers, which are compute and storage. So that's what's happening even in the new workload. The other thing you mentioned is the cloud migrations are still going on. In fact, one of the stats I had was SQL latest SQL Server growing as an IaaS service in Azure. And so that's one of the reasons why we have to think about our commercial cloud and keep it balanced with the rest of our AI cloud, because when clients bring their workloads and bring new workloads, they need all of these infrastructure elements in the region in which they're deploying.\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Analyst)\nYeah. Okay, perfect. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Raimo. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you all.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation. Have a great night.",

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press *0 on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Neilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, we will provide an earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed Outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThey are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website. Today's call is being recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nYou can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made in this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong start to our fiscal year. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $49 billion, up 26% year over year, and our commercial RPO increased over 50% to nearly $400 billion with a weighted average duration of only two years. We are seeing increasing demand and diffusion of our AI platform and family of Copilots, which is fueling our investments across both capital and talent. When it comes to infrastructure, we're building a planet-scale cloud and an AI factory, maximizing tokens per dollar per watt while supporting the sovereignty needs of customers and countries. We're innovating rapidly across the family of Copilots, spanning the high-value domains of information work, coding, security, science, health, and consumer.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs you saw yesterday, we closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, marking the next chapter in what is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has ever seen. This is a great milestone for both companies, and we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth across multiple dimensions. Already, we have roughly 10x our investment. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services. Our rev share, exclusive IP rights, and API exclusivity for Azure continue until AGI or through 2030, and we have extended the model and product IP rights through 2032. We are also energized to innovate and pursue AI advancements with both talent and compute investments that have real-world impact. With that, let's turn to our momentum across our AI platform and Copilots, as well as with agents.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe have the most expansive data center fleet for the AI era, and we are adding capacity at an unprecedented scale. We will increase our total AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next two years, reflecting the demand signals we see. Just this quarter, we announced the world's most powerful AI data center, Fairwater in Wisconsin, which will go online next year and scale to 2 gigawatts alone. We have deployed the world's first large-scale cluster of NVIDIA GB300s. We are building a fungible, global fleet that's being continuously modernized and spans all stages of the AI lifecycle, from pre-training to post-training to synthetic data generation and inference. It also goes beyond Gen AI workloads to recommendation engines, databases, and streaming. We're optimizing this fleet across silicon, systems, and software to maximize performance and efficiency.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt's this combination of fungibility and continuous optimization that allows us to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and our customers. For example, during the quarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4-1 and GPT-5, two of the most widely used models, by over 30% per GPU. We also have the most comprehensive digital sovereignty platform. Azure customers in 33 countries are now developing their own cloud and AI capabilities within their borders to meet local data residency requirements. In Germany, for example, OpenAI and SAP will rely on Azure to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector. On top of this infrastructure, we're building Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and agents. We have 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 500.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe offer developers and enterprise access to over 11,000 models, more than any other vendor, including, as of this quarter, OpenAI's GPT-5, as well as xAI's Grok-4. For example, Ralph Lauren used Foundry to build a conversational shopping experience in its app, enabling customers to describe what they're looking for and get personalized recommendations. Open Evidence used Foundry to create its AI-powered clinical assistant, which surfaces relevant medical information to physicians and helps streamline charting. When it comes to our first-party models, we're excited by the performance of our new MAI models for text, voice, and image generation, which debuted among the top in the industry leaderboards. We continue to make great progress with our Phi-3 family of SLMs, which now have been downloaded over 60 million times, up 3x YoY.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nBeyond models in Foundry, we are providing everything developers need to design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Our new Microsoft Agent Framework helps developers orchestrate multi-agent systems with compliance, observability, and deep integration out of the box. For example, KPMG used the framework to modernize the audit process, connecting agents to internal data with enterprise-grade governance and observability. These kinds of real production-scale AI deployments are driving Azure's overall growth, and once again, this quarter, Azure took share. Now let's turn to applications and agents we ourselves are building on this platform. We now have 900 million monthly active users of our AI features across our products. Our first-party family of Copilots now has surpassed 150 million monthly active users across information work, coding, security, science, health, and consumer. When it comes to information work, we continue to innovate with Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nCopilot is becoming the UI for the Agentic AI experience. We have integrated chat and Agentic workflows into everyday tools like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams. Just nine months since release, tens of millions of users across the Microsoft 365 customer base are already using chat. Adoption is accelerating rapidly, growing 50% quarter over quarter, and we continue to see usage intensity increase. This quarter, we also introduced Agent Mode, which turns single prompts into expert-quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and then iterates to deliver the final product, much like Agent Mode in coding tools today. We're thrilled by the early response, including third-party benchmarks that rank it best in class. Beyond individual productivity, Copilot is multiplayer with Teams Mode announced this week.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou can now invite colleagues into a Copilot conversation, and our collaborative agents like Facilitator and Project Manager prep meeting agendas, take notes, capture decisions, and kick off group tasks. We are seeing a growing Copilot agent ecosystem with top ISVs like Adobe, Asana, Jira, LexisNexis, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake, and Workday all building their own agents that connect to Copilot. Customers are also building agents for their mission-critical business processes and workflows using tools like Copilot Studio and integrating them into Copilot. The overall number of agent users doubled quarter over quarter, and just yesterday, we announced App Builder, a new Copilot agent that lets anyone create and deploy task-specific apps and agents in minutes grounded in Microsoft 365 context. All this innovation is driving our momentum. Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAll up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot. Accenture, Bristol-Myers Squibb, EY Global, and the UK's Tax and Payment and Customs Authority all purchased over 15,000 seats this quarter. Lloyd’s Banking Group has deployed 30,000 seats, saving each employee an average of 46 minutes daily. A large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats. Our partner, PwC, alone added 155,000 seats this quarter and now has over 200,000 deployed across its global operations. In just six months, PwC employees interacted with Microsoft 365 Copilot over 30 million times, and they credit this agentic transformation with saving millions of hours in employee productivity. When it comes to coding, GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI pair programmer now with over 26 million users.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nFor example, tens of thousands of developers at AMD use GitHub Copilot, accepting hundreds of thousands of lines of code suggestions each month and crediting it with saving months of development time. All up, GitHub is now home to over 180 million developers, and the platform is growing at the fastest rate in its history, adding a developer every second. 80% of new developers on GitHub start with Copilot within the first week. Overall, the rise of AI coding agents is driving record usage with over 500 million pull requests merged over the past year. Just yesterday at GitHub Universe, we introduced Agent HQ. GitHub Copilot and Agent HQ are the organizing layer for all coding agents, extending the GitHub primitives like PRs, issues, and actions to coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cognition, xAI, as well as OSS and in-house models.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nGitHub now provides a single mission control to launch, manage, and review these agents, each operating from its own branch with built-in controls, observability, and governance. We're building a similar system in security with over three dozen agents in Copilot integrated across Entra, Defender, Purview, and Intune. For example, with our phishing triage agent in Defender, studies show that analysts can be up to 6.5 times more efficient in detecting malicious mails. In health, Dragon Copilot helps providers automate critical workflows. This quarter alone, we helped document over 17 million patient encounters, up nearly 5x year over year. More than 650 healthcare organizations have purchased our ambient listening tech to date, including University of Michigan Health, where over 1,000 physicians are actively using it. Finally, when it comes to AI consumer experiences, we are excited about all the progress Copilot is making, starting with Windows.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nEvery Windows 11 PC now is an AI PC. Two weeks ago, we introduced new ways to speak naturally to your computer, including a Copilot wake word. With Vision, Copilot sees what you see on your screen, and you can have a real-time conversation about it. With Action, it takes real action on your behalf, interacting with both web and desktop apps. In Edge, we are introducing first-of-its-kind AI features to automate multi-step workflows within the browser and help you pick up right where you left off. Edge now has taken share for 18 consecutive quarters. In Bing, our overview pages now include embedded conversational capabilities. We took share again in search. Daily users of our Copilot consumer app increased nearly 50% quarter over quarter. Among many updates we made last week is Groups, which turns Copilot for the first time into a shared experience.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe also are creating a great consumer subscription offer with Microsoft 365 Premium. It brings together our Office applications and advanced Copilot features with high usage limits, giving individuals the flexibility to bring their own AI to work in a secure way. Finally, in gaming, Copilot provides a voice-first immersive experience across PC, mobile, and our new Xbox Ally. Beyond our family of Copilots and AI platform, we are seeing strong momentum across the portfolio. Cloud migrations are accelerating. In data and analytics, Fabric revenue grew 60%, which is faster than any other data and analytics platform in the industry. We now have 28,000 paid Fabric customers. In databases, SQL DB hyperscale revenue was up nearly 75%, 50% in Cosmos DB. In business applications, Dynamics 365 gained share.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIn security, our end-to-end stack is now informed by 100 trillion daily signals, 1 billion monthly active users of Entra, 16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter over quarter, 40,000 Sentinel customers. We took share across all categories we serve in security. In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3 billion members. In gaming, we expanded our reach across every endpoint focused on our high-margin content and services. We launched critically acclaimed games like Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Outer Worlds 2, reaching 155 million monthly active users in Minecraft, an all-time high, and set new records for overall content and services revenue for the quarter. We also saw a great response to Xbox Ally launch two weeks ago and set new records for players on PC. In closing, our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook. I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI yesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their workloads, and together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real-world needs. Our Q1 results were not impacted by the deal signed this week. Now, on to the quarter. We delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses, demonstrating our leadership position in key markets. This quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nEarnings per share was $4.13, an increase of 23% and 21% in constant currency when adjusted for the impact of our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down slightly year over year, driven by investments in AI, including the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. This was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 commercial cloud. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud and AI engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio. Operating margins increased year over year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger than anticipated results in high-margin businesses this quarter.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWhen adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million, as interest income more than offset interest expense, which includes the interest payments related to data center finance leases. Capital expenditures were $34.9 billion, driven by growing demand for our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand, growing first-party apps and AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams, as well as continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large data center sites. Cash paid for PP&E was $19.4 billion.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAs a reminder, the difference between total CapEx and cash paid for PP&E is primarily due to finance leases, as well as the normal timing of goods received but not yet paid. Cash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. Free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion, with minimal impact from a sequential increase in CapEx, given the higher mix of finance leases. Finally, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI, as well as continued growth in the number of $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and M365.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThese results do not include any impact from the incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $392 billion and was up 51% year over year. The balance has nearly doubled over the past two years. Even with this growth, our weighted average duration has been relatively stable at approximately two years. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion ahead of expectations and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68% and down year over year due to the investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, as noted earlier. Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion and grew 17% and 14% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nM365 commercial cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency, with one point of benefit from end-period revenue recognition. Year over year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats, with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher than expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by marketing solutions. The talent solutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nDynamics 365 revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased, driven by efficiency gains in M365 commercial cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI, including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot chat. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 24% and 20% in constant currency. Operating margins increased three points year over year to 62%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, as well as improved operating leverage. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. In Azure and other cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating demand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nResults were ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations, and this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads, even as we brought more capacity online. In our on-premise server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year over year, driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year over year, as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nRevenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 6% year over year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support, as well as a benefit from inventory levels that remain elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, driven by growth in volume, as well as a continued benefit from third-party partnerships that was better than expected. In gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Against a strong prior year comparable, Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by better than expected performance from third-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year over year, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nOperating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency, and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating margins increased three points year over year to 30%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by two points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and one point in More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by one point. Starting with the total company, we expect revenue of $79.5 to $80.6 billion U.S. dollars, or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of $26.35 to $26.55 billion U.S.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\ndollars, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of $17.3 to $17.4 billion U.S. dollars, or growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality. Now, other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI's conversion to a public benefit corp and the ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, we'll provide our outlook excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is estimated to be roughly $100 million, as interest income will more than offset interest expense. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Next, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we're increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nTherefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY26 growth rate to be higher than FY25. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low expiry base, when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. We expect commercial bookings will be positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year over year, driven by the continued investments in AI, as well as the mix shift to Azure. Now to segment guidance.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $33.3 to $33.6 billion, or growth of 13% to 14%. In M365 commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter over quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products include components that can be variable due to the end-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-20s, driven by growth in ARPU. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. In Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens, with continued growth across all workloads.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $32.25 to $32.55 billion, or growth of 26% to 27%. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, as demand remains significantly ahead of the capacity we have available. While we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first-party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts, and the end-of-life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect to be capacity-constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in the year-over-year growth rates, depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from end-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits, with ongoing customers' shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be in the $13.95 to $14.45 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows 10 end of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year over year. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low double digits, down sequentially as growth rates normalize, following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nGrowth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. In Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. Hardware revenue should decline year over year. In closing, demand signals across bookings, RPO, and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected. We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent, and product innovation to capture that momentum and expand our leadership position. We remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable revenue growth for the long term. With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\n**Operator**\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your headset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Managing Director)\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on another outstanding quarter. If I'm looking at Microsoft, this is two quarters in a row. We're really seeing results that are well ahead of anybody's expectations. When we were thinking about this company a year ago or five years ago, 111% commercial bookings growth was not on anybody's bingo card, if you will. Yet the stock is underperforming the broader market. The question I have is kind of getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock, and it's something about to change. I think AGI is kind of a nomenclature or a shorthand for that. It's something that's still included in your OpenAI agreement.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Managing Director)\nSatya, when we think about AGI or we think about how application and computing architectures are changing, is there anything that you see on the horizon, whether it's AGI or something else, that could potentially change what appears to be a really strong positioning for Microsoft in the marketplace today, or that strength will perhaps weaken on a go-forward basis? Is there anything that you're worrying about in that evolution, and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nNo, thank you, Keith, for the question. Here's how I would say that I think there are two parts. We feel very, very good about even this, I would say, the new agreement that we now have with OpenAI, because I think even it just creates more certainty to all of the IP relationship we have as it relates to even this definition of AGI. Beyond that, I think your question touches on something that's pretty important, which is how are these AI systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and make a real difference and make a return for both the customers who are deploying them and obviously the providers of these systems?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nI think the best way to characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let's even say exponentially, like model version over model version, the problem is it's always going to still be jagged. I think the term people use is the jagged intelligence, even it or spiky intelligence. You may even have a capability that's fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow. What is required is, in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or the Microsoft 365 Copilot system, don't think of this as a product. Think of it as a system that in some sense smooths out those jagged edges and really helps the capability. Just to give you a flavor for it, if I am in Microsoft 365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThe good news is now an Excel spreadsheet does understand Office JS, has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is a great spreadsheet created by a good modeler. The more interesting thing is I can go into agent mode in Excel and iterate on that model, and yet it'll stay on rails. It won't go off rails. It'll be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to the analyst agent, and then it'll even make sense of it like a data analyst would of an Excel model. The reason I say all of that is because that's the type of construction that'll be needed, even when the model is magical, all-powerful. I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nOne of the fundamental things that these, whether it's GitHub, whether it's security, whether it's Microsoft 365, the three main domains we're in, we feel very, very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to help customers. By the way, that's the same thing that we're going to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. That's kind of how people will build these multi-agent systems. I feel actually pretty good about both the progress in AI. I don't think AGI, as defined at least by us in our contract, is ever going to be achieved anytime soon. I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with advances in AI models by building these systems. It's kind of the real question that needs to be well understood. I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Managing Director)\nExcellent. That's super helpful.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\n**Brent Thill** (Managing Director and Tech Sector Leader)\nThanks. Amy, on the bookings blowout, I guess many are somewhat concerned about concentration risk. I think you noted a number of $100 million contracts. Not to go into a lot of detail, can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing on that 51% RPO and 110%+ bookings growth that gives you confidence about what you're seeing in terms of the breadth and extent of some of these deals on a global basis? Thanks.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThanks, Brett. A couple of things to maybe take a step back on RPO. With a nearly $400 billion balance, we've been trying to help people understand sort of how to think about really the breadth of that. It covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. That's been a balance that we've been growing, obviously, at a good clip. What people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya is talking about around creating systems and where we're investing. If you're going to have that type of balance, and then more importantly, have the weighted average duration be two years, it means that most of that is being consumed in relatively short order. People are not consuming, and I say this broadly, unless there's value.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI think this is why we keep coming back to are we creating real-world value in our AI platforms, in our AI solutions and apps and systems. I think the way to think about RPO is it's been building across a number of customers. We're thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We're learning a ton and building leading systems because of it that are being used at scale that benefits every other customer. It's why we've tried to give a little bit more color to that RPO balance, because I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about is it long-dated? Is it coming over a long period of time? Hopefully, this is helpful for people to realize that these are contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAt that type of scale, I think that's a pretty remarkable execution.\n\n**Brent Thill** (Managing Director and Tech Sector Leader)\nThank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brett. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (SVP, Managing Director, and Senior Global Software Research Analyst)\nThank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. It's pretty amazing what you guys are doing. Satya and Amy, I'd like to ask you the number one question I receive, whether from investors or at AI conferences I attend. How much confidence do you have that the software and even the consumer internet business can monetize all the investments we're seeing globally, or frankly, are we in a bubble? In fact, Amy, what would be the factors you'd be watching for to assure that you're not overbuilding for current demand and that demand will sustain? Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nMaybe I'll start, Satya, and then you could add. Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots, because with $400 billion of RPO that's sort of short-dated, as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out the infrastructure are very high. That's for booked business today. That is not any new booked business we started trying to accomplish on October 1, right? The way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular, and as we talked about 2026, the remainder. Number one, we're pivoting toward increasingly, we talked about this, short-lived assets, both GPUs and CPUs. Again, we talk about all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building. Now, when that happens, short-lived assets generally are done to match sort of the duration of the contracts or the duration of your expectation of those contracts.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI sometimes think when people think about risk, they're not realizing that most of the lifetimes of these and the lifetimes of the contracts are very similar. When you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet and the depreciation of short-lived assets, they're actually quite matched, Mark. As you know, we have spent the past few years not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se. We were short the space or the power, is the language we use to put them in. We spent a lot of time building out that infrastructure. Now we're continuing to do that, also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we've talked about, 15 to 20 years. Over that period of time, do I have confidence that we'll need to use all of that? It is very high.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWhen I think about sort of balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPU, CPU short-lived, seeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are, and I said this now, we've been short now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch up. We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places. We're seeing usage increases in products. We are seeing new products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing usage very quickly. When people see real value, they actually commit real usage. I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be thought through completely, is that when you see these kind of demand signals and we know we're behind, we do need to spend.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWe're spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in bookings, and I feel very good about that. I have said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest in product R&D, and we're doing end-of-life replacements in the fleet. We're going to spend to make sure that happens. It's about modernization, high quality, service delivery, and meeting demand. I feel good about doing that, and I feel good that we've been able to do it so efficiently and with a growing book of business behind it.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, the only thing I would add to what Amy captured was if you sort of look out, there are two things that matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D. One is how efficient is our planet-scale token factory? I mean, that's at the end of the day what you have to do. In order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible, global fleet. It's not like we're building one data center in one region in the world that's mega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training, for RL, for data synth, what have you. Therefore, the fungibility is super important. The second thing that we're also doing is continually modernizing the fleet.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt's not like we buy one version of, say, NVIDIA and load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year you buy, you ride the Moore's Law, you continuously modernize and depreciate it. That means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-4.1 and 5.0. That's software. By the way, it's helpful on A100s. It's helpful on GB200s, and it'll be helpful on GB300s. That's the beauty of having the efficiency of the fleet. Keep improving utilization, keep improving the efficiency. That's what you do in the token factory. The other aspect, which Amy spoke to, is we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high-value domains. It's in information work. That's the Copilot system. Coding.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nI mean, I should also say one of the things I like about Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPUs compared to M365 ARPUs. It's expansive. The same thing that happened between server and cloud, like we used to always say, is it zero sum? It turned out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market. The same thing is happening in AI, because first, you could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to M365, or you could say we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expansive. Same thing with tools. I mean, tools business was not like a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one of the most expansive AI systems. We feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security. Same thing with health.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIn consumer, one of the things is it's not just about ads. It's ads plus subscriptions. That also opens up opportunity for us. When I look at the entirety of these high-value agent systems and when we look at the efficiency and fungibility of our fleet, that's what gives us the confidence to invest both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (SVP, Managing Director, and Senior Global Software Research Analyst)\nThat was pretty amazing. I really appreciate all the detail.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nOK, yeah, thank you. This one is for Amy. Amy, I certainly don't want to take you down too complex an accounting path with this question, but the investment in OpenAI that sits in other income at $4.1 billion is so large that I think the audience listening in could benefit from a little bit more color about what that is. It feels like it's so much larger than you were running through other income in prior quarters that it mustn't just be your share of the OpenAI losses. Could you just describe that and what we can expect in subsequent quarters and whether this signals any kind of accounting change? Thanks so much.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe Q1 number was not impacted at all by the new agreement that was put in place. Let me first say that. Secondly, that increased loss was all due to our percentage of losses in OpenAI's debt equity method. Just to be very clear, there is not anything there that is not the increased losses from OpenAI.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nOK, understood. Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThanks, Karl.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (Executive Director)\nThank you so much. We seem to be entering into a new era where the contractual commitments from a small number of AI natives are just incredibly large, not only in absolute terms, but sometimes relative to the size of the companies themselves. For instance, contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars that are 20 times their current revenue scale. Philosophically, how do you evaluate the ability of those companies to follow through on these commitments? How do you think about placing guardrails on customer concentration for any single entity?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, maybe I'll start, and then Amy, you can add. It goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about building first the asset itself such that it's most fungible. Then to recognize the strength of even sort of our portfolio. We have a third-party business. We have a first-party business. We have third-party also spread between enterprise, digital natives. I always felt that we need a balance there, because it may start with digital natives. They're always going to be the early adopters. You always have the hit app of the generation. Then essentially, it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting. Therefore, having over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt's great to have the hit first-party apps in the beginning, because you can build scale that then if it's fungible, and that's where the key is. You don't want to build for a digital native as if you're just doing hosting for them. You want to build. That's where I think some of the decision-making of ours is probably getting better understood. What do we say yes to? What do we say no to? I think there was a lot of confusion. Hopefully, by now, anyone who switched on would figure this out. That's, I think, one thing we're doing on the third party. The first party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes. It's not even about one hit app on our first party even.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nOur portfolio of stuff, which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us again the confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum. Remember, these assets, especially the data centers and so on, are long assets. There will be many refresh cycles for any one of these when it comes to the gear. I feel that once you think about all those dimensions, the concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nMaybe just to help with another angle of that, because I think Satya's helped a lot, when you think about concentration risk or delivering to any customer, you have to remember that because we're talking about this very large flexible fleet that can be used for anyone and for any purpose, 1P, 3P, and including our commercial cloud, by the way, which I should be quite clear on, it is pretty flexible in every regard. You have to remember that the CPU and GPU and the storage gear doesn't come into play until the contracts start happening. You're right, some of these large contracts have delivery dates over time, so you get a lot of lead time in being able to say, oh, what's the status? I think we're pretty thoughtful around what's always gone in our RPO balance and been considerate of that.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThere's always been that taken into account when we publish that bookings number and publish the RPO balance.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (Executive Director)\nThank you very much.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. I'll echo my congrats on an amazing start to the year. Amy, is there any way to quantify or frame the revenue impact of Azure being short on capacity? I appreciate the constraints you face are broad across the industry. Is there risk of workloads going elsewhere? How do you mitigate that?\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nYeah, Brad, it's a great question. It's always hard to quantify precisely what would have been the revenue impact in quarter. I would offer a way to think about it is Azure probably does bear most of the revenue impact, because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first, it's obviously the increasing usage and adoption and sales we've seen of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the usage of Copilot Chat, which we've seen very different patterns, which we're encouraged by. It's the adoption of security features. It's the GitHub momentum. When you're thinking about it, that is where, and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there first. You're all right to ask, how do I think about that?\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWe've worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure, and we've been clear on it. I would say the other two priorities that I haven't mentioned maybe as much before is also just making sure our product teams and the AI talent that we've been able to hire into the company really over the past year and a half have access also to significant capacity, because we're seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding great benefit today into products people are using today for real-world work. We are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that, as well as our product engineering teams. Yes, it does impact Azure directly. That is the place where you see that prioritization.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI think it's probably hard for me to give an exact number, but it is safe to say that the number could be higher.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Operator**\nThe last question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nThank you very much. Amy, I just wanted to congratulate you. I think you said before that it is possible to accelerate Azure growth while getting efficient margins, and you've done it. Congrats on that. I have one for you, Satya. With respect to the elephant in the room, following just being a little more direct, following up on Keith Weiss's question, there's talk that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business that was rightfully Microsoft. I'm sure that there is a different point of view here. I'm wondering if you could offer some perspective on your criteria. Is it about a certain volume of business that you wish to execute on the Microsoft paper? Or is it something broader than that?\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nI don't think maybe people fully appreciate the terminal value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts, which I think is probably being underestimated as you have a full stack and you've got the multiple vectors to monetize the databases, Foundry. To your point that you are a platform company, not just a hyperscaler, maybe that's what it is all about. Or maybe there's another story about you letting the other hyperscaler company come in from nowhere and claiming a big piece of that four to five-year puzzle. Thank you so much once again. Really appreciate it. Congratulations.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you, Kash. For us, again, it just always goes back to, I think, the core principle, which is build a fleet that is fungible across the planet and works for third-party and first-party and research. That's essentially what we have done.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWhen some demand comes in shapes that don't fit that goal, where it's too concentrated, not just by customer, by location, by type of skewing, I think Amy mentioned some very key things. When you think about the margin profile of a hyperscaler, you've got to remember there's the AI accelerator piece, but there's compute, there's storage. If all of the demand just comes for just one meter, that's really not a long-term business we want to be in. That's even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first-party stuff, because that's after all a different margin stack for us. We have to fund our own R&D and model capability, because in the long run, that's what's going to differentiate us. I look at all of those.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe sort of use all of that to make sure we are saying yes to all the demand that we want. We say no to some of the demand that may be something that we could serve, but it's not in our long-term interest. That's sort of the decision-making we've done. We feel very, very good about the decisions. In some sense, I feel even each time we say no to, the day after I feel better.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCash, maybe just.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCash, I think this is our last call with you. I just want to say thanks and congratulations. It's been a privilege to work with you, and best of luck.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nLet me add to that. Best of luck, Kash.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nThanks. Thank you so much. Very kind of you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Cash. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you all.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGreetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year twenty twenty five Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Nielsen, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer Alex Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel.

Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10 ks, Forms 10 Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168,000,000,000 in annual revenue, up 23%. The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and tech stack at massive scale.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack starting with Azure. Azure surpassed $75,000,000,000 in annual revenue, up 34% driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year. We opened new DCs across six continents and now have over 400 data centers across 70 regions more than any other cloud provider. There is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first gigawatt and multi gigawatt data centers.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWe stood up more than two gigawatts of new capacity over the past twelve months alone and we continue to scale our capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI first. All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And we are driving and riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon systems and models to continuously improve efficiency and performance for our customers. Take for example, GBD4O family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThrough software optimizations alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago. Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to address customers' unique data residency and sovereignty requirements. This quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry's most comprehensive solution spanning both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating growth from migrations again this quarter.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nNestle, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000 plus servers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near zero business disruption. That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be quantum and I'm excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of Level two quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing. This is how we will continue to think and make investments with decade long arcs while making progress every quarter.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThe next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application. Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning everything from SQL to NoSQL to analytics workloads. It continues to gain momentum with revenue up 55% year over year and over 25,000 customers. It's the fastest growing database product in our history. FabricOnely expands all databases and clouds including semantic models from Power BI and therefore it is the best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and context engineering.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAzure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well. Cosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission critical workloads at scale. OpenAI for example uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every chat GPT interactions storing chat history, user profiles and conversational state and Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPT as well as OpenAI's developer APIs. This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Foundry features best in class tooling, management, observability and built in controls for trustworthy AI.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nCustomers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet their specific performance, cost and use case requirements. And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput ones and apply it across more models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI's Grok and very soon Black Forest Labs and Mistral AI. We sim shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year, providing same day access to state of the art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure and tools. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry agent service, which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents that automate complex tasks. For example, NASDAQ is using Foundry to build agents that help customers prepare for board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAll up 80% of Fortune five hundred already use Foundry. And when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry APIs, we processed over 500,000,000,000,000 this year, up over 7x. This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded in our daily work and life. Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100,000,000 monthly active users across commercial and consumer.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd when you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800,000,000 monthly active users. Microsoft three sixty five Copilot is becoming the new way to organize work and workflow and work artifacts. We rolled out our biggest update to three sixty five Copilot to date this quarter, bringing together chat, search, create notebooks as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding. With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeing real momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft three sixty five suite with strong usage intensity as shown by our week over week retention.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd we saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch with a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft three sixty five Copilot to 100,000 employees globally following a successful initial deployment of 15,000. UBS is expanding its deployment to all of its employees after initially rolling it out to 55,000 of them. And Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo, purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter. Tens of thousands of organizations have already used our researcher and analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability and we have introduced group level agents in teams like facilitator and interpreter, which generate real time translation and notes in meetings.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nHundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday have built their own third party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams. We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to extend Microsoft three sixty five Copilot and build their own agents. This year customers created 3,000,000 agents using SharePoint and Copilot Studio. And with Copilot tuning, they can easily create agents fine tuned on their company's data, workflow and style that reflect their unique tone, language and expertise. We're also seeing great traction among specific roles and functions starting with developers.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nGitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with agent mode and new form factors like coding agent, which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have 20,000,000 GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot enterprise customers increased 75% quarter over quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own code basis and 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot. More broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThe surge in wide coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is Cloud Code, Codex, Cursor or GitHub Copilot are generating more pull requests and more repos on GitHub. And our code review agent is being used heavily across the platform performing millions of code reviews each month. In healthcare, we had a breakout year for Dragon Co Pilot. Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13,000,000 physician patient encounters this quarter, up nearly 7x year over year. For example, at Mercy Health System, more than 1,000 physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden so that they can focus on providing better care.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThey have saved more than one hundred thousand hours to date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one physician put it, the best thing to happen to my practice in ten years. And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle high volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the BizApps market as customers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications. Dynamics three sixty five took share this year and we are winning customers in every industry like Verizon with sales, Domino's Pizza Group with ERP, one-eight 100 Flowers with contact center.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWhen it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces. In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot mode in Edge. It's especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers. Copilot mode brings together Copilot Composer, Chat, Discover, Search and Actions to build the next generation of browser for the AI age. Our Copilot consumer app also continued to see strong growth in engagement and successful sessions and we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWith Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real time insights and assistance on anything. And we are well positioned as we approach Windows 10 end of support in October, thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot plus PCs, which offer customers compelling security as well as AI value. Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure as well as our Copilots and agents. We have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year. Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer data across our first party tools as well as third party ecosystem over three fifty connectors.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWe're also extending the systems customers already use for governance, identity, security and management to protect every AI agent. Entra now extends identity permissions policies and access controls to agents. Defender secures nearly 2,000,000 general AI apps. Purview is used by three quarters of the Microsoft three sixty five Copilot customers to protect their data. And all up, we now have nearly 1,500,000 security customers and continue to take share across all major categories we serve.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nBefore I wrap, I want to talk about two consumer businesses of ours with massive end user reach, LinkedIn and Xbox. LinkedIn is home to 1,200,000,000 members with four consecutive years of double digit member growth. All up comments on LinkedIn rose over 30% and video uploads increased over 20% this year. We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience introducing agents across hiring as well as sales. When it comes to gaming, we have 500,000,000 monthly active users across platforms and devices.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWe are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter with successful launches of Forza Horizon five and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger. 50,000,000 people have played Black Ops six, Total hours surpassed 2,000,000,000. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWe surpassed over 500,000,000 of gameplay stream via the cloud this year and Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5,000,000,000 for the first time. In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI and I have never been more confident in Microsoft's opportunity to drive long term growth and define what the future looks like. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This year, we delivered over $281,000,000,000 in revenue, up 15% year over year, which reflects the broad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over $128,000,000,000 up 17% year over year as we invested against the expansive opportunity ahead. And in our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. As Satya shared, we're innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to our customers.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThis quarter revenue was $76,400,000,000 up 1817% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 1615% in constant currency, while operating income increased 2322% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.65 an increase of twenty four percent and twenty two percent in constant currency. For the first time commercial bookings were over $100,000,000,000 increasing 3730% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals as well as an increase in the number of 10,000,000 and $100,000,000 plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft three sixty five helped drive these results.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368,000,000,000 up 3735% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized in revenue in the next twelve months, up 21% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next twelve months increased 49%. And this quarter our annuity mix was again 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $46,700,000,000 ahead of expectations and grew 2725% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68% down two points year over year from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure partially offset by continued efficiency gains in Azure and M365 Commercial Cloud. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down one point year over year driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 65% in constant currency and operating margins increased two points year over year to 45%. Better than expected revenue growth coupled with a focus on operating efficiently drove the margin expansion.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAt a total company level, headcount at the June was relatively unchanged year over year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33,100,000,000 and grew 1614% in constant currency better than expected driven by M365 Commercial Products and Cloud Services and M365 Consumer Products and Cloud Services. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue was ahead of expectations and increased 1816% in constant currency with two points of benefit from in period revenue recognition. Business trends remained relatively stable to the prior quarter when excluding the in period revenue recognition with ARPU growth again driven by E5 and M365 Co Pilot.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nPaid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year over year with installed base expansion across all customer segments though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 97% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher than expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue was better than expected increasing 20% driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscriber growth of 8%. LinkedIn revenue increased nine percent and eight percent in constant currency with growth across all businesses. The Talent Solutions continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nDynamics three sixty five revenue increased 2321% in constant currency with strong execution in our core annuity sales motions leading to growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 1615% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by the efficiency gains noted earlier even as we deliver more AI features across our products and scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 76% in constant currency and operating income increased 2119% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $29,900,000,000 and grew 2625% in constant currency ahead of expectations driven by Azure and our on premises server business.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nIn Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 39% significantly ahead of expectations driven by accelerated growth in our core infrastructure business primarily from our largest customers. As a reminder, new cloud and AI workloads are built and scaled using the breadth of our services. Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with expectations. And while we brought additional data center capacity online this quarter demand remains higher than supply. In our on premises server business revenue decreased 23% in constant currency ahead of expectations primarily driven by transactional purchasing which also has higher end period revenue recognition.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nEnterprise and Partner Services revenue increased 76% in constant currency with growth in Enterprise Support Services partially offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 1716% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased four points year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 64% in constant currency and operating income grew 23%. Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $13,500,000,000 and grew 9% exceeding expectations primarily due to Windows OEM as well as Xbox content and services.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWindows OEM and devices revenue increased 3% year over year ahead of expectations as inventory levels remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 2120% in constant currency driven by continued growth in both volume and revenue per search as well as roughly eight points of favorable impact from third party partnerships including the benefit of a low prior year comparable. And in gaming, revenue increased 10%. Xbox content and services revenue increased 1312% in constant currency driven by better than expected performance from first party content and Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nGross margin percentage increased three points year over year with improvement across all businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% in constant currency. Operating income increased 3433% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24,200,000,000 including $6,500,000,000 of finance leases, where we recognized the full value at the time of lease commencement.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nCash paid for PP and E was $17,100,000,000 The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half our spend was on long lived assets that will support monetization over the next fifteen years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers both CPUs and GPUs and driven by strong demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $42,600,000,000 up 15% driven by strong cloud billings and collections partially offset by higher supplier payments. And this quarter free cash flow was $25,600,000,000 Other income and expense was negative $1,700,000,000 primarily due to losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $9,400,000,000 to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37,000,000,000 for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U. S.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nDollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY 2026. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately two points and to increase operating expense growth by one point. Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double digit revenue and operating income growth in FY 2026.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWe will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth as we shared last quarter will moderate compared to FY 2025 with a greater mix of short lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1 including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We remain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing our operational agility. And as a result, we expect operating margins to be relatively unchanged year over year.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd finally, we expect our FY 2026 effective tax rate to be between 1920%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly three points in Productivity and Business Processes and roughly one point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by roughly one point.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nIn commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and long term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long term Azure contracts which are more unpredictable in their timing drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67% down year over year driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AI infrastructure. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30,000,000,000 driven by the continued strong demand signals we see.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAs a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of 32,200,000,000.0 to $32,500,000,000 or growth of 14% to 15% with roughly three points of benefit from FX as noted earlier. In M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 1314% in constant currency with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nM365 Commercial Products revenue growth should be in the mid to high single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes both the Windows commercial on premises components of M365 suites and office transactional purchasing both of which can be variable due to end period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the low 20s driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics three sixty five, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens with continued growth across all workloads.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $30,100,000,000 to $30,400,000,000 or growth of 25% to 26% with roughly one point of benefit from FX as noted earlier. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year on year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online as well as from in period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be 12,400,000,000.0 to $12,900,000,000 Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOverall Search and News advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits against a strong prior year comparable. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of 24,300,000,000.0 to $24,500,000,000 or growth of 21% to 22% and operating expense of 15,700,000,000.0 to $15,800,000,000 or growth of 5% to 6%.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOther income and expense is estimated to be negative $1,300,000,000 primarily due to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark to market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 1920%. In closing, we finished the year with double digit revenue and operating income growth and exceeded the FY 2025 operating margin commitment we shared a year ago. Our focus remains on investing in security, quality and AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our customers.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWe are excited for FY 2026. With that, let's go to Q and A, Jonathan.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q and A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\n**Operator**\nThank And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Equity Analyst)\nThank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic end to FY 2025. I've been covering like this off for a while. I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where like everything came together this well. So congratulations on that.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThank you for calling InCom Conferencing. The next available operator will be with you momentarily.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo these are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build both the products as well as the platform. And then broadly they or rather over time, there will be broad diffusion. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app usage, but also what's the sort of all the Tier two applications that are being built. So that sort of that speaks a little bit, Keith, to I think your question is as long as we have head apps shaping the platform and then after that we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense we're both of those is what we're seeing. So I feel very good about being in standing going forward.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (MD, SVP &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nThank you. I'd also give you my congratulations. Amazing. I didn't know how you were going to beat last quarter and you did it. So congratulations.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (MD, SVP &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nAnd thank you for taking my question. Satya and Amy, we're now two plus years since the Gen AI revolution and adoption is still early in ramping. What do you think is the best way that software companies are going to be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do you believe there are differences in monetization for horizontal more general apps like M365 Copilot or Dynamics CRM Copilot versus very targeted capacities on the AgenTex side? And also how should you think about the trajectory of SaaS AI margins over the long term? Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYes. I'll start and Amy, you should feel free to add. I mean, if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I think just like the server to cloud transition, was an expansion of essentially usage of servers. That is essentially what happened with the cloud, right, which is we did a bunch of servers except that the expertise required, the capital required, the time required to bring up servers, build it out, scale it was just all hard. And so therefore, the market was a certain size, whereas with the cloud, you could sort of buy it with flexibility, you could burst and you could spin up and spin down, expertise required came down.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo it was just orders of magnitude. That's what's happening.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo if you sort of even subscribe to this point of view that intelligence is basically log of compute, That means compute is going to grow and you've got to use it as efficiently as possible to just keep creating intelligence. Now, how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure? I kind of to Keith's earlier question, I talked a little bit about how infrastructure is getting shaped, data layer is getting shaped, the app server is getting built. These are all classic categories of infrastructure that will continue, but they will be an order or two of magnitude more. So literally like in fact, of the other things we track is every GPU requires storage and compute.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThat ratio is another thing that is really exponential for infrastructure growth. So when you go to the app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now building in effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence and they're also building autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications like a database application perhaps, but they are being used increasingly inside of a user interaction. I think a good example is GitHub Copilot. It got started as an ex you know, code completions on an IDE.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThen we added the chat interface to it. Then we added the agent mode to it. And now we have an autonomous agent, which in fact works completely asynchronously. Right? So all those four things, are now part of essentially GitHub.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd by the way, it also turns out that every other tool that is also doing any form of coding is adding more and more GitHub repos. So if I had to think about GitHub monetization, we have an opportunity around just monetizing GitHub Enterprise and then we have the ability to think about GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot as with all these form factors. And so that's exactly the same thing that's happening with Microsoft three sixty five. That's the same thing that's happening with Dynamics three sixty five. So you have to be very open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier and your UI tier and sort of being more expansive in it.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAs long as you do that, it's just that usage goes up, and that's what I think shows up in the results.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the things and the layers Hathi talked about is really we're seeing very similar monetization tools exist in this transition, right? There's a per user logic, there's tiers of per user, sometimes those tiers relate to consumption, sometimes there's pure consumption models. I think you'll continue to see a blending of these, especially as the AI model capability grows, you'll end up with ways that teams are going to want to throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job. And I think the blending of these models will continue to be something we see on a go forward basis.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (MD, SVP &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nThank you. I appreciate it.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director - Software Equity Research)\nOkay. Thanks. Sachin and Amy, this is the second quarter in a row of pretty material Azure upside from what sounds like an acceleration in on prem to Azure migration activity. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the plethora of customer conversations you've had whether there are a couple of two or three specific catalysts that are driving that migration and how durable a trend do you think that is? Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYes. I mean just there are three things that are really happening. One is the migrations. A good example would be what I referenced in my remarks with Nestle with the SAP instances. They moved along with a lot of the data that's associated with it in a bunch of servers.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo that's kind of a classic example. I think whether it's VMware migrations or migrations of SAP or even just our own server migrations, they're pretty healthy. And as it turns out that we're still not anywhere close to the finish line, if at best maybe in the middle innings of that. The second thing that's also happening is cloud native applications that are scaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff, just the classic cloud native e commerce company, let's say.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThese are scaling in a big way. And some of those customers were not on Azure previously, but now they're increasingly there because they have come for AI perhaps, but they now stay for more than AI. And so to me, that's another thing you see in overall, what's happening across the Azure number. And then of course there are the new AI workload. So those are three things that are all in some sense building on each other, but that's kind of what's driving our growth.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director - Software Equity Research)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\n**Brent Thill** (MD &amp; Tech Sector Leader - Software &amp; Internet Research)\nSatya, back to the strength across the board in the quarter. Was there anything that jumped out you or surprised you that you didn't think you were going to see, but you did see in the quarter? Just the magnitude of upside, I think, had shocked many here.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYes. I don't know, Brett, if anything really surprised us. But I think what, we are noticing in our own build out of these AI applications and in general is the platform is becoming more than here is a model and here is an API, make some calls, right? I mean that in some sense, was a bit of the state of the art maybe even a year ago. Whereas now you have essentially these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that require quite a bit of rethinking of even the app stack.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI mean, take even the storage tier stuff, The degree of sophistication you have and hey, how much of an index do you really want to build by pre processing so that your prompt engineering or context engineering as I called can be better and higher quality. So I think all of that is emerging. So when I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric and Cosmos DB, all of the things, the frameworks around it are just becoming robust to build serious applications. And so that's what I feel great about is the learning curve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of this tech, the speed with which that's emerging, that you can build applications is much faster, right? I always go back and say, hey, when a relational database came out, it took a while for people to build an ERP system, let's say.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd this thing, we're kind of building pretty sophisticated applications at a very, very fast clip based on I think the degree of maturity that's emerging.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Managing Director)\nPerfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well. I had one question around Copilot, and I'm obviously a happy user here at Barclays. If you think about it, the one thing that we're all realizing is that Copilot is the AI part, but data is becoming more and more important.\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Managing Director)\nAnd then from there on, we can start thinking about agents. Where is the what are you seeing in your customer conversations, Satya, about like that understanding that Copilot is actually just the starting point and then from there on it's becoming like much, much broader? Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYes. I think that that's right. Even inside of Copilot, I'm sure you're seeing it, right? You now have analyst and researcher to just talk about two examples and of course, people, all the third party agents. So yes, there is a lot more of this is not request response.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nIt's about spawning essentially applications, that then go to work and come back. But the UI still remains very important, right? Even for asynchronous work to instruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronous work, you need UI. It may be different.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nIt may not be a chat interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is, right? So even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you're not using GitHub Copilot to create the code check-in or the pull request, interestingly enough, we're seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot code review agent, even if you used maybe Code or whatever else to write the code. So that's I think what's happening across all of these systems.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo you're absolutely right that you need it starts with some kind of a UI that's more chat focused, but it quickly goes beyond it. And you see it in M365, you see it in Dynamics three sixty five and you see it in GitHub.\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Raimo. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nHi, thank you very much. Amy, I want to acknowledge that, I think a few quarters ago, you said that you reach a point in time where you can accelerate Azure while slowing down CapEx. So you did it. But what is the outlook? When I look at the CapEx guidance for the upcoming quarter, certainly, I would view that as a positive indicator of the book of business you have for your cloud services.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nBut how should we think about the shape of the curve of CapEx vis a vis Azure growth rate in the years ahead, particularly as I listened to Satya's comments on the AI stack consuming more and more infrastructure? Are we at a point where we're going to have to continue to do this and we magically wait for inference and applications to kick in and therefore create a richer gross margin mix? Thank you so much for your comments and congrats on the quarter.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThanks, Kash. Let me back up and first say, when you think about the full year comments I've made on CapEx as well as the Q1 guidance of over 30,000,000,000 you first have to ground yourself in the fact that we have $368,000,000,000 of contracted backlog we need to deliver not just across Azure, but across the breadth of the Microsoft cloud. So in terms of feeling good about the ROI and the growth rates and the correlation, I feel very good that the spend that we're making is correlated to basically contracted on the books business that we need to deliver and we need the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in place as quickly and effectively as they can. And so when you look, we've talked about the growth rate will decline year over year, but at its core, our investments, particularly in short lived assets like servers, GPUs, CPUs, networking storage, is just really correlated to the backlog we see and the curve of demand. And I talked about, my gosh, in January and said, I thought we'd be in better supplydemand shape by June.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd now I'm saying, I hope I'm in better shape by December. And that's not because we slowed CapEx even with accelerating the spend and trying to pull leases in and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly as we can. We are still seeing demand improve. And so I am not as focused, Kash, on trying to pick a date at which revenue growth and CapEx growth will meet and cross. I'm focused on building backlog, building business and delivering capacity, which we are seeing has a good ROI today in terms of our ability to get that done.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo I don't want people to get overly focused on a pivot point because when you're in sort of these expansive moments, picking a data point usually means you're going to pick to be too conservative in terms of market share gain and in terms of winning. And so I tend to put my energy more there. Yes.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI think one of the other things, Kash, is that I think I said this in a previous earnings as well, which is the difference between a holster and a hyperscaler is software, and the same is going to be true here. That GPD four point example I gave is all software, The optimization even in the last year. So we know how to use the software skills to take any piece of hardware and make it multiple X better. And so that's kind of where the yield will come. But as Amy said, while you're really going and building out the plant, you don't want to sort of You just want to go in parallel on all of these fronts, and that's sort of what will compound over time.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd I do think it's important when Plata talks about the software layer, he's talking about in his comments to connect this back to the compounding S curves. And so I would remind people that is something that we saw through the prior cloud transition. It's how we operated through that one. And the same sort of skills and logic done at an even faster pace is what will apply the same transition.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nSounds very encouraging. Thank you so much.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\n\n**Michael Turrin** (MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, great. Thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats from me as well on the metrics working in concert here. Amy, maybe on margin impressive to hear expectations for flat operating margin in the upcoming year as you absorb some of the mix shift towards Azure and some of the more AI focused offerings. Can you speak in more detail just around your ability to manage those trade offs and offset some of the mix shift? And I'm wondering specifically just on any productivity gains you're seeing from leveraging AI internally that you'd highlight or anything else you just mentioned in underpinning the full year expectation there? Thanks,\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nMichael. I think really, the area to focus on is when you think about margin. I think sometimes people get a lot of energy around cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus on making sure you deliver great product that's competitive and innovative and can take share because that drives revenue. And revenue itself and revenue growth, as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durable way to see margin improvement.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nIt builds on itself. That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked to Cash a little bit about before, Tati and I both mentioned it, is applying all of our skill set here to deliver efficiencies, whether that's at whatever layer of the stack that exists. The S curve is compound, and we are doing that work, and we're focused on it. At the same time, we're doing the build out. So you'll see improvements there even as we continue to invest.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd then, of course, it's about continuing to have great talent here, focus on products and opportunities where we have the biggest markets and the most likelihood of success. And so when we have those three things happen and the energy is right and the focus is there, it gives me confidence in terms of margin delivery. But make no mistake, it starts and ends really with product, which is what we're really focused on here and delivering that to customers.\n\n**Michael Turrin** (MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nThat all sounds pretty good. Thanks very much.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP - IR)\nThanks, Michael. That wraps up the Q and A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGreetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year twenty twenty five Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Nielsen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer Alex Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non GAAP items.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThe non GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rates only.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThese statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10 ks, Forms 10 Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThank you, Jonathan. It was a record quarter driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $42,000,000,000 in revenue, up 22% in constant currency. Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs and accelerate growth. Now I'll highlight examples starting with infrastructure. We continue to expand our data center capacity.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThis quarter alone, we opened DCs in 10 countries across four continents. Model capabilities are doubling in performance every six months, thanks to multiple compounding scaling laws. We continue to optimize and drive efficiencies across every layer from DC design to hardware and silicon to system software to model optimization all towards lowering costs and increasing performance. You see this in our supply chain where we have reduced dock to lead times for new GPUs by nearly 20% across our blended fleet where we have increased AI performance by nearly 30% ISO power and our cost per token, which is more than halved. When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand with customers in every industry from Abercrombie and French to Coca Cola and ServiceNow, expanding their footprints on Azure.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd we remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission critical VMware, SAP and Oracle workloads with more regional availability than any other hyperscaler. We're also excited about the next frontier in cloud systems with Quantum. In addition to putting our Quantum stack on machines from our partners, we're also making real progress on a path to a utility scale quantum computer with the introduction of Majorana One. When it comes to data and analytics, we have deeply integrated our AI platform with our data stack. PostgreSQL usage accelerated for the third consecutive quarter and it is now used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500, including companies like BMW and BNY Mellon.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nCosmos DB revenue growth also accelerated again this quarter and remains the go to database for globally distributed NoSQL workloads at any scale. It is used by customers in every industry like CarMax, DocuSign, NTT Data and OpenAI. This quarter, we also saw analytics consumption accelerate. Microsoft Fabric has more than 21,000 paid customers, up 80% year over year. Fabric brings together data workloads like data warehousing, data science, real time intelligence along with Power BI into one end to end solution.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nReal time intelligence is now the fastest growing workload in fabric with 40% of customers already using it in just five months since becoming generally available. All up more than 50% of fabric customers like AmorePacific, Louisiana State Government and Petrobras use three or more workloads. And the amount of data in our multi cloud data lake, OneLake has grown more than 6x over the past year. Now on to AI Platform and Tools. Foundry is the agent in AI app factory.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nIt's now used by developers at over 70,000 enterprises and digital natives from Atomic Work to Epic, Fujitsu and Gainsight to H and R Block and LG Electronics to design, customize and manage their AI apps and agents. We processed over 100,000,000,000,000 tokens this quarter, up 5x year over year, including a record 50,000,000,000,000 tokens last month alone. And four months in, over 10,000 organizations have used our new agent service to build, deploy and scale their agents. This quarter, we also made a new suite of fine tuning tools available to customers with industry leading reliability. And we brought the latest models from OpenAI along with new models from Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, Stability to Foundry.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd we've expanded our PHY family of SLMs with new multimodal and mini models. All up PHY has been downloaded 38,000,000 times. And our research teams are taking it one step further with BitNet B1.58, a billion parameter large language model that can run on just CPUs coming to the foundry. Now on to developer tools. We are evolving GitHub Copilot from pair to peer programmer.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWith agent mode in Versus Code, Copilot can now iterate on code, recognize errors and fix them automatically. This adds to other Copilot agents like AutoFix, which helps developers remediate vulnerabilities as well as Code Review Agent, which has already reviewed over 8,000,000 pull requests. And we are previewing a first of its kind SWE Agent capable of synchronously executing developer tasks. All up, we now have over 15,000,000 GitHub Copilot users up over 4x year over year. And both digital natives like Twilio and enterprises like Cisco, HPE, Skyscanner and Target continue to choose GitHub Copilot to equip their developers with AI throughout the entire dev life cycle. With Visual Studio and Versus Code, we have the world's most popular editor with over 50,000,000 monthly active users.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd with Power Platform, we have the leading low code platform for AI makers too. We now have 56,000,000 monthly active Power Platform users, up 27% year over year, who increasingly use our AI features to build apps and automate processes. Now on to future of work. Microsoft three sixty five Copilot is built to facilitate human agent collaboration. Hundreds of thousands of customers across geographies and industries now use Copilot, up 3x year over year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOur overall deal size continues to grow and this quarter we saw a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. And we are going further. Just last week, we announced a major update bringing together agents, notebooks, search and create into a new scaffolding for work. Our new researcher and analyst deep reasoning agents analyze vast amounts of web and enterprise data to deliver highly skilled expertise on demand directly within Copilot. Beyond horizontal knowledge work, we are introducing agents for every role and business process.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nOur sales agent turns contacts into qualified leads and with Sales Chat reps can quickly get up to speed on new accounts and our customer service agent is deflecting customer inquiries and helping service reps resolve issues faster. With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot and build their own agents with no code, low code. More than 230,000 organizations including 90% of the Fortune 500 have already used Copilot Studio. With deep reasoning and agent flows in Copilot Studio, customers can build agents that perform more complex tasks and also handle deterministic scenarios like document processing and financial approvals. And they can now build computer use agents that take action on the UI across desktop and web apps.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd with just a click they can turn any SharePoint site into an agent too. This quarter alone customers created over 1,000,000 custom agents across SharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130 quarter over quarter. When it comes to business applications, Dynamics three sixty five again took share as companies like Avaya, Brunswick, Softcat switched to Dynamics from legacy providers. Verizon for example chose Dynamics three sixty five sales to improve the efficiency of its sellers. In Healthcare, Dragon Co Pilot is off to a fast start.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nLast quarter alone we helped document nearly 9,500,000 physician patient encounters at providers like City of Hope, Ottawa Hospital, Tufts Medicine and Wellstar up over 50% quarter over quarter. In manufacturing, we introduced factory operations and safety agents at Hanover Massay and leading partners like Autodesk, PTC and Siemens have all built their own industrial AI solutions on our stack. And in retail, we have introduced agents to help customers like Bath and Body Works build more personalized shopping experience and improve store operations. When it comes to Windows Copilot plus PCs are faster and have better battery life than any other device in their category. We also continue to win new customers with best in class AI capabilities.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWe offer a growing number of AI apps from partners like Adobe, Canva and Zoom. Just last week, we rolled out exclusive AI experiences like Recall, Click to Do and Windows Search to all Copilot plus PCs. And we continue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end of support for Windows 10. Windows 11 commercial deployments increased nearly 75% year over year. Now on to security.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSecurity is our top priority and we have made significant progress against the engineering objectives we outlined a year and a half ago as part of our Secure Future initiative. We are now applying these learnings to deliver new innovation across our platform. Last month along with our partners, we introduced security copilot agents to help defenders autonomously handle high volume security and IT tasks informed by 84,000,000,000,000 daily threat signals. We also added new capabilities to Defender, Entra and Purview to help organizations secure and govern their AI deployments. All up, we now have 1,400,000 secondurity customers, over 900,000 including Global, ManpowerGroup, TriNet, Regions Bank have four or more workloads, up 21% year over year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd in Identity, Entra now has more than 900,000,000 monthly active users. Now on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Over 1,000,000,000 professionals use LinkedIn to connect, learn, hire and sell and our membership continues to grow at double digits year over year. Time spent watching videos on the platform was up 36% and comments were up 32% year over year. We're also seeing more members use AI to gain new skills and find jobs.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThe number of learners who have used AI powered coaching increased over 2x quarter over quarter. And we remain the market leader in hiring as customers like Equinix and Verizon use LinkedIn hiring assistance to find qualified candidates faster. When it comes to LinkedIn Premium, we saw over 75% quarter over quarter subscriber growth to our Premium Pages offering for SMBs. And LinkedIn marketing solution continues to be the best way to reach B2B decision makers with two consecutive quarters of accelerated revenue growth. More broadly, when it comes to advertising, we are transforming how people search, browse, discover content and use AI as a personal assistant.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWith Copilot Search in Bing, we are reimagining search results with overview pages curated by AI and embedded conversational capabilities. With Copilot Vision and Edge, Copilot sees what you see and gives you real time responses while you browse. With Copilot Discover, we are personalizing experience based on user interactions and preferences. And with our updated Copilot app, we are focused on building daily engagement and successful sessions across a range of modalities, whether it is conversing, searching, shopping or travel planning. All up, we again took share across Bing and Edge and our total advertising revenue across our businesses has surpassed $20,000,000,000 over the past twelve months.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nNow on to Gaming. We continue to transform the business and focus on margin expansion as we bring our games to over 500,000,000 monthly active users across devices. We ended the quarter as the top publisher by pre orders and pre installs on both Xbox and PlayStation Store. PC Game Pass revenue increased over 45% year over year with Xbox Play Anywhere players now can access more than 1,000 games they can play across console and PC. And just last week, we brought cloud gaming to LG TVs.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nCloud gaming set a new record surpassing 150,000,000 hours played for the first time this quarter. We are also integrating AI across the Xbox. New Copilot for Gaming is a personalized gaming companion that provides in game assistant and expert coaching and our first of its kind Muse model can generate gameplay in real time. Finally, it's fantastic to see the success of the Minecraft movie, which is the top grossing film of the year. In addition to monetizing our IP in new ways, we have seen a 75% plus increase in weekly active users of the game year over year since the release.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nIn closing, we are rapidly innovating opportunity across both consumer and commercial businesses. In just a few weeks at our BUILD conference, we'll share how we are creating the most powerful AI platform for developers and I encourage you to tune in. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter revenue was $70,100,000,000 up 1315% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 1113% in constant currency, while operating income increased 1619% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.46 an increase of 1819% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations driven by focused execution from our sales and partner teams.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nWe continue to see strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings as they help customers drive productivity, increase efficiencies and grow their businesses. And again this quarter revenue from our AI business was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 1817% in constant currency significantly ahead of expectations again this quarter driven by an Azure commitment from OpenAI. We also saw consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long term commitments to our platform. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $315,000,000,000 up 3433% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nRoughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next twelve months up 17% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next twelve months increased 47%. And this quarter our annuity mix was 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue and operating expense growth. FX decreased COGS growth by only one point, one point unfavorable to expectations.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $42,400,000,000 ahead of expectations and grew 2022% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 69% in line with expectations and decreased three points year over year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage was also 69% down one point year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 23% in constant currency lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies as well as investments that shifted to Q4. Operating margins increased one point year over year to 46% better than expected as we continue to focus on building high performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAt a total company level, headcount at the March was 2% higher than a year ago and was down slightly compared to last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29,900,000,000 and grew 1013% in constant currency ahead of expectations driven by LinkedIn, Microsoft three sixty five Commercial Products and Microsoft three sixty five Consumer. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 1215% in constant currency in line with expectations. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nWith M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth across customer segments and geos. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year to over $430,000,000 While we continue to see installed base expansion across all customer segments growth was primarily driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 58% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher than expected office transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 1012% in constant currency ahead of expectations driven by higher than expected subscription growth following the January price increase. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 9% to $87,700,000 LinkedIn revenue increased seven percent and eight percent in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nResults were ahead of expectations due to better than expected performance across all businesses. The Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics three sixty five revenue increased 1618% in constant currency in line with expectations with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 1013% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 12% in constant currency and operating income increased 1518% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26,800,000,000 and grew 2122% in constant currency ahead of expectations driven by Azure. In Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 3335% in constant currency including 16 points from AI services. Focused execution drove non AI services results where we saw accelerated growth in our enterprise customer segment as well as some improvement in our scale motions. And in Azure AI services we brought capacity online faster than expected.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nIn our on premises server business revenue decreased 64% in constant currency slightly below expectations driven by renewals with lower in period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. The year over year decline is reflective of the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue increased 56% in constant currency slightly ahead of expectations due to better than expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 1314% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased four points year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 67% in constant currency and operating income grew 1718% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nNow to more personal computing. Revenue was $13,400,000,000 and grew six percent and seven percent in constant currency ahead of expectations due to better than expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 3% year over year ahead of expectations as tariff uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventory levels that remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 2123% in constant currency. Results were significantly ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third party partnership, better than expected rate expansion and volume growth across Edge and Bing.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd in gaming, revenue increased 56% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue increased 89% in constant currency ahead of expectations driven by stronger than expected performance in third party and first party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 911% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased two points year over year driven by strong execution on margin improvement in Search and Gaming. Operating expenses increased 1%.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nOperating income increased 2123% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $21,400,000,000 slightly lower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases. Cash paid for PP and E was $16,700,000,000 roughly half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long lived assets that will support monetization over the next fifteen years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers both CPUs and GPUs to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog of $315,000,000,000 Cash flow from operations was $37,000,000,000 up 16% driven by strong cloud billings and collections partially offset by higher tax payments.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd this quarter free cash flow was $20,300,000,000 Other income and expense was negative $623,000,000 more favorable than anticipated primarily due to net gains on derivatives and investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were slightly higher than expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9,700,000,000 to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 15% year over year. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a U.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nS. Dollar basis. First, through April demand signals across our commercial businesses as well as in LinkedIn, gaming and search have remained consistent. Our outlook assumes those trends continue in Q4. If the environment changes, our results may be impacted.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nIn our Windows OEM business, our outlook assumes the elevated inventory levels from Q3 will come down in Q4. We have widened our guidance range in our More Personal Computing segment to account for some of this variability. Next, FX. With the weakening of the U. S.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nDollar in April, we now expect FX to increase total revenue growth by one point. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by one point in Productivity and Business Processes and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS operating expense growth by less than one point. In Commercial Bookings, we expect solid growth on a significant prior year comparable and a growing ex pre base. Bookings growth will be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long term commitments to our platform.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAs a reminder, larger longer term Azure contracts which are more unpredictable in their timing can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67% down year over year primarily driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. And now capital expenditures. We expect Q4 capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis. H2 CapEx in total remains unchanged from our January guidance.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAs a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of US32.05 billion dollars to US32.35 billion dollars or growth of 11% to 12% in constant currency. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. We expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot and some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nM365 Commercial Products revenue growth should be in the mid single digits. As a reminder, M365 Commercial Products includes both the Windows commercial on premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing both of which can be variable due to end period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid teens driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics three sixty five, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens with continued growth across all workloads.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $28,750,000,000 to $29,050,000,000 or growth of 20 to 22% in constant currency. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from in period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be between 3435% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. In our non AI services, we expect focused execution to continue driving healthy growth. And in our AI services, while we continue to bring data center capacity online as planned, demand is growing a bit faster.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nTherefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June. In our on premises server business, we again expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. And the Enterprise and Partner Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits driven by Enterprise Support Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12,350,000,000 to $12,850,000,000 Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue to decline in the low to mid single digits assuming OEM inventory levels come down through the quarter as noted earlier.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAlthough the range of potential outcomes is wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline in the high teens. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens even on a strong prior year comparable. We expect to see continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Overall search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the mid teens.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd in gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the high single digits driven by first party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of 23,600,000,000.0 to $23,800,000,000 or growth of 19% to 20% in constant currency and operating expense of $18,000,000,000 to $18,100,000,000 or growth of approximately 5% in constant currency. Therefore, even with ongoing AI investments as we scale, we continue to expect full year FY 2025 operating margins expected to be roughly negative $1,200,000,000 primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAs a reminder, we do not recognize mark to market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Now I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We remain committed to investing against the strong demand signals we see for our services. So as a reminder, our earlier comments on FY 2026 capital expenditures remain unchanged.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nWe expect CapEx to grow. It will grow at a lower rate than FY 2025 and will include a greater mix of short lived assets, which are more directly correlated to revenue than long lived assets. These investments along with focused execution that delivers near term value to our customers will ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead. With that, let's go to Q and A, Jonathan.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q and A. Out of respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\n**Operator**\nAnd our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Equity Analyst)\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. In what all of us are looking at as a difficult environment, a lot of uncertainty out there, so really impressive to put up the results that you guys did. One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media and press reports was changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoft walking away from some of those data center commitments. But it sounds like the AI demand is very strong.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Equity Analyst)\nYou're talking about not being able to hit all that demand with supply. So could you talk to us about what's going on with your data center strategy? Are there any shifts taking place? And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the comments that you had made about the potential risk for oversupply in GPUs out in the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about?\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Equity Analyst)\nAnd are you incorporating that risk into your data center strategy?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYes. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the question. The reality is we've always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build all through the last whatever, ten, fifteen years. It's just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays. Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our build and lease be positioned for what is the workload growth of the future.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nRight? So that's what you have to go and seek to. So there's a demand part to it. There is the shape of the workload part to it and there is a location part So you don't want to be upside down on having one big data center in one region when you have a global demand footprint.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYou don't want to be upside down when the shape of demand changes because after all with essentially pre training plus test time compute, that's a big change in terms of how you think about even what is training, right, forget inferencing. So fundamentally given all of that and then every time that there's great Moore's Law, but remember this is a compounding sort of S curve, right, which is Moore's Law, there's system software, there's model architecture changes, there's the app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we're building accounting for the latest and greatest sort of information we have on all of that. And that's what you see reflected. And I feel very, very good about the pace.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nIn fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so therefore but it's not power it's not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want. And so that's the sort of plan that we're executing to. Maybe Amy, you can add to that.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nYes. Maybe just to add a little bit to Satya's comments. Just a reminder, these are very long lead time decisions from land to build to build outs can be lead times of five to seven years, two to three years. So we're constantly in a balancing position as we watch demand curves and many of the things Satya watched. And the second part is just to maybe remind you when Satya talks about being short power, he's really talking about data center space.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so we've continued through the second half to put things in place. In fact, we talked a little bit about pulling even some of that space to be ready earlier and being able to deliver that earlier to customers this quarter, which is really good work by the teams as we continue to get more and more efficient at that process. And I look forward to being able to continue to do that in the future. I did talk about in my comments, we had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4. We did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSo, we are going to be a little short, still stay a little tight as we exit the year, but are encouraged by that.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Equity Analyst)\nExcellent. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\n**Brent Thill** (Tech Sector Leader, Software/Internet Research)\nThanks. Satya, on your comment about accelerating demand for cloud migrations, I'm curious if you could dig in and extrapolate a little more what you're seeing there? Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThanks, Brent. So yes, so I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud all in parallel and there's also a relationship between them. One is, I'll just say the classic migration of whether it's SQL, Windows Server. And so that sort of again got good steady state progress because the reality is, I think everyone's now perhaps there's another sort of kick in the data center migrations just because of the efficiency, the cloud provides. So that's sort of one part.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThe second piece is good data growth. You saw some like Postgres on Azure. I mean, forgetting even SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing, Cosmos is growing. The analytics stuff I talked about with Fabric. It's even the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSo we feel very good about Fabric, growth and our data growth. Then the cloud native growth. So this is again before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption of cloud native players is also pretty very healthy. It was healthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go moving forward as well.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThen the thing to notice is the ratio and I think we mentioned this multiple times before. If you look underneath even chat GPT, in fact that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI accelerators they need, they use Cosmos DB, they use Postgres, they use core compute and storage. And so there's even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator to others. So those are the four pockets, I'd say, or four different trend lines which all have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and I talk a lot about this, this time around there's nothing certain for sure in the future except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd the good news here is the next big platform shift builds on that. So it's not a complete rebuild. Having gone through some of these platform shifts where you have to come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here and is that we have a good business in Azure that continues to grow and the new platform depends on that. So we want to stay disciplined and execute super well on that.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThank you. Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (Managing Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst)\nThank you very much for taking my question and I will reiterate what my peers have said. Congratulations on the great quarter. Satya and Amy, Microsoft is a very different business than it was during the last recession. Incredible job you've done. If we get into a recession, I hope we don't, how do you think about the stability, the sustainability, revenue volatility of Microsoft today if we were to get into recession?\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (Managing Director, SVP and Senior Research Analyst)\nWould the business react early to recession or late? Would a recession have a more shallow impact on revenue? Any thoughts would\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nbe appreciated. Maybe I'll start and then Amy should add, Mark. The way at least I think we will approach it is quite frankly be very focused on how we help our customers. If there is any turbulence in the macro. Because one of the things that we feel we can't do just because of the efficiencies of the cloud And the footprint we have and the differentiated sort of layers of the stack from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nI think if you sort of buy into the argument that software is the most malleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super helpful in that. And so if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset is how do we make sure we are helping our customers. And then of course, we'll look to share gains.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director - Software Equity Research)\nOkay. Thanks. A number of metrics to applaud, but I think the one that stands out to me is the 16 growth rate lift to Azure from AI. Sachin, Amy, I just wanted to ask if you could unpack that a little bit. Of course, you mentioned that you got a bit of a kicker from capacity coming online. But I'm a little bit more interested in where the demand came in above expectations, like what workload type. It's hard for us to see that on the outside. Was it a surge in ChatGPT inference that landed in Azure?\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director - Software Equity Research)\nWas it an uptick in enterprise AI adoption? And Amy, do you think that 16 points could be higher in June? Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThanks, Carl, for the question. Just to provide some clarity, because I think your question implies something that we didn't mean to imply on the call. First, the real outperformance in Azure this quarter was in our non AI business. So then to talk about the AI business, really what was better was precisely what we said. We talked about this.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nWe knew Q3 that we had really matched supply and demand pretty carefully and so didn't expect to do much better than we had guided to on the AI side. We've been quite consistent on that. So the only real upside we saw on the AI side of the business was that we were able to deliver supply early to a number of customers. And being able to do that throughout the quarter creates quite a good benefit to us. But the majority of our outperformance versus where we had expected to be was on the non AI piece of the business.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nHi, thank you very much. One question for Amy. You've said in the past that you can attain better and better capital efficiency with the cloud business and probably cloud and AI business. Where do you stand today, Amy? Maybe, Satya, you can opine as well, that you've said before that you can slow down your CapEx growth rate while still accelerate Azure, which includes AI.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nCan we get a mark to market on that? Thank you so much.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nMaybe I'll I'll start, Kash, and let Satya add on. Because I really think when you go back and read some of Satya's comments on how the s curves build on themselves, that's actually the levers that go into the answer of the question that you're asking. And so the way, of course, you've seen that historically is, right, when we went through the prior cloud transitions, you see CapEx accelerate, you build out data center footprints, you slowly fill CPU capacity. And over time, you see software efficiencies and hardware efficiencies build on themselves. And you saw that process for us for, goodness, now quite a long time.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd what Tatya is talking about is how quickly that's happening on the AI side of the business and you add to that model diversity. So think about the same levers plus model efficiency, those compound. Now the one thing that's a little different this time is just the pace. And so when you're seeing that happen, pace in terms of efficiency side, but also pace in terms of the build out, So it can mask some of the progress, but we are working hard across all of the teams, hardware, software, even the build teams to get things in place as quickly as possible, dock to live times. All of that is improving and all of that actually is benefiting us.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd I'll go ahead and say, our margins on the AI side of the business are better than they were at this point by far than when we went through the same transition and the server to cloud transition.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYes. I mean, I think at a macro level, think the way to think about this is you can ask the question, what's the difference between a hosting business and a hyperscale business? It's software. That's I think the gist of it. We asked for sure it's a capital intensive business, but capital efficiency comes from that system wide software optimization.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nAnd that's what makes the hyperscale business attractive and that's what we want to just keep executing super well on.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nSuper. Thanks so much.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nOperator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (MD - Software Research)\nThank you so much. Satya, you had commented recently that the DeepSeek moment is a real thing. And you had said that software efficiencies mean that the fleet will be aged for a longer time. Can you comment on how those advances are affecting the pace and volume of AI experimentation and activity in the marketplace? And Amy, could we start to consider the possibility that software enhancements might extend the useful life assumption that you're using for GPUs?\n\n**Mark Murphy** (MD - Software Research)\nOr is it a little premature to be thinking that way?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nYeah. First of all, I think some of the work that actually OpenAI first pioneered and did with all of the reasoning models and of course DeepSeek has sort of added to it and done good work as well and others as well. The idea that you can have test time compute plus pre training and then some of the great optimization at inference time that has all happened has proven out. I mean if you look at it, I would say for every Moore's law change and movement, there's probably a 10x improvement because of software, right? That's sort of what's happening with these models.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nSome of it comes from model architecture, some of that comes from data efficiency, compute efficiency and what have you. So that's what we are riding and we feel that all up when you have a commodity that is getting that better then the question is how do you build out a fleet that's super balanced so that then the workloads can be built and can in fact take advantage of that efficiency at the underlying infrastructure. I mean it's kind of like virtualization. What is the difference between servers and sort of again client server with virtualization? It was efficiency.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nWhat is the difference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency. What is the difference between this generation of cloud and AI? It's efficiency. So the more you can kind of continue to think about software driving that efficiency is what drives demand ultimately.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd to your specific question, in terms of thinking about the depreciable life of an asset, we like to have a long history before we make any of those. We're focused on getting every bit of useful life we can, of course, out of assets. But to Tatya's point, that tends to be a software question more than a hardware one.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (MD - Software Research)\nThank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\n\n**Kirk Materne** (Senior Managing Director, Equity Research)\nYes, thanks very much and congrats on a great quarter. Amy, you mentioned that the upside in Azure came from the non AI services this time around. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. And I guess as you look forward, maybe what's different this go round versus what we saw a few years ago when obviously things like optimization weighed on the growth a little bit? It sounds like the product portfolio is much broader right now.\n\n**Kirk Materne** (Senior Managing Director, Equity Research)\nBut just wondering if you could add some color on that front. Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nSure. And thanks for the question, Kirk. When we go to non AI, I talked a little bit about this. In general, we saw better than expected performance across our segments, but we saw acceleration in our largest customers. We call that the enterprise segment in general.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd then in what we talked about of our scale motions where we had some challenges in Q2, things were a little better. And we still have some work to do in our scale motions, and we're encouraged by our progress. We're excited to stay focused on that as, of course, we work through the final quarter of our fiscal year. By geo, the performance was pretty consistent. Satya actually highlighted some of the workloads that came in a little better than we thought.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nObviously, just some good consistent work on migrations, good execution by the sales and partner teams, the data workloads he went through. And so in general, Kirk, I wouldn't say it's anything beyond that. I do think it was improved execution, And I was happy to see it, but there's still some work to do on our scale motions in particular.\n\n**Kirk Materne** (Senior Managing Director, Equity Research)\nThank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThanks, Kirk. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Operator**\nThe last question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Alex Zukin** (Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. And again, just amazing congratulations on those Azure numbers, which I think are quite honestly just inspiring. So so maybe to Amy, to to the point that you're making that the surprise factor was on the non Azure, non AI side of the house. And and it sounds like that there's confidence in that continuing, beyond.\n\n**Alex Zukin** (Analyst)\nHow much of that are you starting to see the pull pull in of the non AI driven by the AI portion of Azure? And on the AI portion specifically, as test time compute really just blows out kind of prior conceptions of scaling law challenges, how much does that change potentially the curve of the AI Azure growth as you go forward here over the next few quarters?\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nHi, Doc. Let me, first of all, say I think we've talked about this quite a bit. It's always good to have a chance to to iterate this. It's getting harder and harder to separate what an AI workload is from a non AI workload. And we've talked about it this way, I think, in most instances, to make sure people understood that when we were accelerating all of our CapEx spend over the past two point five three years now, that people had confidence that we were turning that into revenue and product in a way that was transparent and that everyone could understand really the goals that we had set for ourselves and for our partners and customers in terms of building product that turned to Revit. But if you take a step back from that, it's that these workloads are being built, GPU, CPU, storage, network, all the same things. And so I think, really, what we're talking about is really how Satya talked about in one of the earlier questions. You know, we're seeing digital natives. Digital natives build workloads. They do AI work.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThey do non AI work. Do they tend to do that work in the same cloud? Lots of times. Sometimes, it's all in the same place. Not all the time, but that relationship gets stronger and stronger as people pivot to more of AI heavy workloads.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so I think you're starting to see some of that relationship. I think we'll continue to see that as AI workloads continue to get built and experimented with and proof of concepts get expanded. And so I think I mostly focus on the fact that together we saw good performance in Q3 on Azure. Azure inclusive of both components in terms of our execution, in terms of the field and partner teams and backlog and conversion and interesting workloads and adding customer value and solving real problems and adding real value. And I think that's probably how I would approach that number more than trying to separate it in the way that even we have talked about it, but for very different reasons.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of IR)\nThanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q and A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman &amp; CEO)\nThank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (Executive VP &amp; CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGreetings and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iverson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Brett Iversen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jalla, Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Doliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Brett Iversen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nMore detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Brett Iversen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThey are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Brett Iversen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nWe will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded.\n\n**Brett Iversen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nIf you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events.\n\n**Brett Iversen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThese statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you, Brett. This quarter, we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year over year. Enterprises are beginning to move from proof of concepts to enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd our AI business has now surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year over year. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our approach to how we manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws continue to compound across both pre-training and inference-time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOn inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. And as AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the commercial cloud, we are focused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training and inference, as well as geo-distribution.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nFrom now on, it's a more continuous cycle governed by both revenue growth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects of software-driven AI scaling laws and Moore's Law. With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack. Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years, and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our data centers, networks, racks, and silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next generation AI workloads.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe continue to take advantage of Moore's Law and refresh our fleet, as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost, and HSM. When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloads encompassing nearly 400 billion records and two petabytes of data. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP, and VMware apps.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAt the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric break out. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from Hitachi to Johnson Controls to Schaeffler. Fabric is now the fastest-growing analytics product in our history. Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric, with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% since last year. Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or enterprise AI apps, you see the growth of raw storage, database services, and app platform services as these workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azure app services more than doubled year over year, driving significant growth in adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB. Now on to AI platform and tools. As we shared last week, we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure commitment.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThrough our strategic partnership, we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth. With OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure, customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models. OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAzure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, runtimes to build agents, multi-agent apps, AI ops, API access to thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users. We are well-positioned with our support of both OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of open-source models and SLMs. DeepSeek-R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and GitHub with automated red teaming, content safety integration, and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige, Rockwell Automation, and Siemens to address industry-specific use cases. With AI, how we build, deploy, and maintain code is fundamentally changing. And GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify, as well as the world's largest enterprises like HP, HSBC, and KPMG.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe have been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot in VS Code with more than a million sign-ups in just the first week post-launch. All up, GitHub now is home to 150 million developers, up 50% over the past two years. Now on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of existing enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats. When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than 10x over the past 18 months.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nTo share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each quarter over the past year and now have 40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson, and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this quarter, and overall, the number of people who use Copilot daily again more than doubled quarter over quarter. Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensity increased more than 60% quarter over quarter, and we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat, which was announced earlier this month.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nCopilot Chat, along with Copilot Studio, is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work. With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet. More than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio, and they collectively created more than 400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone, up over 2x quarter over quarter.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe have also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings, manage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries, and access SharePoint data. We also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot. What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI, as well as our momentum with agents, is our rich data cloud, which is the world's largest source of organizational knowledge.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nBillions of emails, documents, and chats, hundreds of millions of Teams meetings, and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the enterprise knowledge cloud. It is growing fast, up over 25% year over year. More broadly, what we are seeing is Copilot plus agents disrupting business applications, and we are leaning into this. With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo, RTX, TotalEnergies, and Vaisala switched to our AI-powered apps from legacy providers.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nIn healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician-patient encounters, up 54% quarter over quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase productivity of their physicians. When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for Windows 10. Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\n15% of premium-priced laptops in the U.S. this holiday were Copilot plus PCs. And we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilot plus PCs. We also see more and more developers from Adobe and CapCut to WhatsApp build apps that leverage built-in NPUs.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd they will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 Distill models locally on Copilot plus PCs, as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. And beyond Copilot plus PCs, the most powerful AI workstation for local development is a Windows PC running WSL2 powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Now on to security.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe continue to make progress with our Secure Future initiative, and we are applying what we have learned, introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year. With Security Copilot, organizations across private and public sector, like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia Bank, NTT, can resolve incidents 30% faster.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nData governance is increasingly critical, and customers now use Microsoft Purview to audit over two billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use. Now on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high-value conversations on LinkedIn, with comments up 37% year over year. Short-form video continues to grow on the platform, with video creation all up, growing at twice the rate of other post formats.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe're also innovating with agents to help recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster, and our hiring business again took share in subscriptions. LinkedIn Premium surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years, and nearly 40% of subscribers have used our AI features to improve their profiles, and LinkedIn Marketing Solution remains the leader in B2B advertising.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nNow on to search advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge. Edge surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters. The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off, and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize ROI, and our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, first-of-its-kind features like Copilot Vision.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nJust today, we made Think Deeper, powered by O1, free for all Copilot users globally. Now on to gaming. We are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth driven by higher margin content and platform services. And we are delivering on this plan. Black Ops 6 was a top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in the franchise history.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than 4 million people. We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. All up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30% as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints. In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help our customers in this AI era. And I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $69.6 billion, up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.23, an increase of 10%.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage with higher-than-expected operating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above expectations.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nCommercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions, with growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nRoughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45% and this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, More Personal Computing revenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased revenue more than expected in our commercial segments.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations, and decreased 2 points over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year to 69%, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses, as well as improvement in gaming and search, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOperating expenses increased 5%, lower than expected, and operating margins increased 2 points year over year to 45%. The better-than-expected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across our businesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications. At a total company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% higher than a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nNow to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $29.4 billion and grew 14% and 13% in constant currency, even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nMicrosoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continued to see growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. Our growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 7% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nM365 Commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by higher-than-expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024, as well as the Windows Commercial on-premises components from the better-than-expected performance of M365 Suite noted earlier.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nM365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw continued momentum in M365 Consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 86.3 million, with mix shift to M365 Basic. LinkedIn revenue increased 9%, with continued growth across all lines of business. In our Talent Solutions business, results were slightly below expectations, driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key verticals.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nDynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, with growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6%, and operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nRevenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19%, with more unfavorable FX impact than expected. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-prem server, and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better-than-expected results in Azure AI services.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year over year and was ahead of expectations, even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market execution challenges, particularly with our customers that we primarily reached through our scale motions, as we balanced driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations, driven by slower-than-expected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1%, below expectations, with lower-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10%, and operating income grew 14%. Now to more personal computing.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nRevenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year over year, with better-than-expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM pre-builds, usage from a third-party partnership in search, as well as Call of Duty launch performance in gaming.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWindows OEM and devices revenue increased 4% year over year, ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 and support, as well as uncertainty around tariffs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nIn gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency, as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 6 points year over year, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses, as well as strong execution on margin improvement in gaming and search. Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased 32% and 30% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI-related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals, including our customer contracted backlog.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nCash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee, and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year over year, reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3 billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our cruise investment. Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nNow, moving to our Q3 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by 2 points in productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud, and roughly 1 point in more personal computing.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWhen compared to our October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 2 points and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOur outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. Demand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth. In commercial bookings, with a relatively flat expiry base and a strong prior-year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be roughly flat year over year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%, down year over year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nNext, to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11%-12% in constant currency, or $29.4-$29.7 billion USD. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth should be between 14%-15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better-than-expected Q2 results.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot, and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. For M365 Commercial products, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year over year. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products include Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 Suites. So our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nM365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high single digits, driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid single digits. Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in Talent Solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency, or $25.9-$26.2 billion US dollars. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAs we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services, healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier, and while we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY25, we should be roughly in line with near-term demand, given our significant capital investments.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits, driven by a decrease in transactional purchasing. And in enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4-$12.8 billion US dollars, with continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWindows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low to mid single digits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year over year, as our outlook assumes inventory levels will normalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nDevices revenue will decline. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-teens, from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, with share gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to moderate from last quarter, primarily due to additional FX impact, and as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier returns to more normal levels.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nSearch ex-TAC growth will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high single digits. In gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits, driven by first-party content, as well as Xbox Game Pass. Hardware revenue will decline year over year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency, or to be between $21.65-$21.85 billion, and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant currency, or to be between $16.4-$16.5 billion.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOther income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion, primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nFirst, FX. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth by roughly one point. Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals, including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nHowever, the growth rate will be lower than FY25, and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets, which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud, including AI workloads.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAs always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. And given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI solutions, we now expect FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd finally, our FY25 full-year effective tax rate should be between 18%-19%. In closing, we are committed to delivering real-world AI solutions that help customers grow and improve their results. We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our customers . Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Brett Iverson is moving to a new role here as the head of our Americas Sales Finance Team. On behalf of the company, thank you for your tremendous impact leading investor relations for the past four years and for the partnership with both Satya and me. And I'd like to welcome Jonathan Nielsen, the former head of finance for our security products, who is returning to investor relations to lead the team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tool will indicate your line's in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed . Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Echoing Amy's comments, Brett, congratulations on the new role. It's been a pleasure working with you, and best of luck in that new role. Looking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings. But again, we were a little bit disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAmy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what the resolutions to those issues were, and do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter? Thank you very much.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Keith. Let me spend a little time on that, about what we saw in Q2, and give you some additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about. First, let me be very specific. They are in the non-AI ACR component.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOur Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by the operating teams pulling in some delivery dates, even by weeks. When you're capacity constrained, weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and you see that in the revenue results. On the non-AI side, really the challenges were in what we call the sales motions.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nSo think about primarily, these are customers we reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the art form there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals. We then took our sales motions in the summer and really changed to try to balance those two.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAs you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars, and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. And I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts and whether you have that balance right.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd so the teams are working through that. They're already making adjustments. And I expect, well, we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through the scale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust. I feel good that the teams understand and are working through that, so hopefully that's just helpful on that, then we've talked a little bit about Q3, and so we've talked about 31%-32% after publishing a 31% this quarter.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOur AI results that we had felt good about and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same, so again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place, and that's no different than it was our expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all, and when I talk about being in a capacity constraint, it takes two things. You have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right? That's the infrastructure and the land, and then you have to have kits.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWe're continuing, and you've seen that's why our spend has pivoted this way, to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short power and space. And so as you see those investments land that we've made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd so the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize, and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that's changed is really that scale motion from my seat. Keith, hope that's helpful, Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nYeah. I think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, the AI growth rate is actually better than what we expected, and we worked through some of the supply stuff, and more importantly, some of the workloads are scaling well.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd when you look underneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is the ratio of even what we would call just regular storage, data services, app services. So underneath a ChatGPT or a Copilot or even the emerging AI workloads in the enterprise. So that's all good. The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, that's also in good shape. And it's just the sales pace where Amy talked about this nuance, right? How do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAt a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation. That's the art form Amy was referencing to make sure you get the right balance. Let me put it this way. You would rather win the new than just protect the past. That's sort of one of the things that we definitely will lean into always.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moordler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you very much for taking my question. Can you give more color on what drove the far larger-than-expected Microsoft AI revenue? We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it, but can you give more color on that? Our estimates are that the Copilot was much bigger than we expected and growing much faster. Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI beat would be great. Thanks.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Mark, for the question. Yes, that was, as we talked about, better than expected. A couple of pieces to that, which you've correctly identified. Number one is the Azure component we just talked about. And the second piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd what was important about that, it was we saw strength both in seats, both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about, and usage, which doesn't directly impact revenue, but of course, indirectly does as people get more and more value out of it. And also, price per seat was actually quite good, which doesn't have a good signal for value. So those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that sort of outperformance in terms of our expectations.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOperator, next question, please.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks. Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek a couple of times in your prepared remarks. I think everyone would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And are we seeing AI scale now at lower cost? Are we reaching a mark where you can see that, or do we still have some time to go? Thanks for your thoughts on this.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nYeah. Thanks, Brent. So yeah, in my remarks, I talked about how, in some sense, what's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle. It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. So there's Moore's Law that's working and HyperDrive.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThen on top of that, there are the AI scaling laws, both the pretraining and the inference time compute that compound. And that's all software. You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we've observed for a while, which is 10x improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference. And so that's what you see.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd then to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in o1. And so we are going to obviously now that's all gets commoditized and it's going to get broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right? Because at the end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client-server to cloud? More people bought servers, except it was called cloud. And so when token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll be more apps written.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd it's interesting to see that when I reference these models that are pretty powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of 2025, where on the PC you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure. So that type of optimizations means AI will be much more ubiquitous. And so therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I'm concerned.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Brett. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThe next question comes from the line of Carl Kearstedt with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you. Maybe this one as well for Satya, and it's also away from the numbers. But Satya, I wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft for sure remaining very committed to OpenAI's success, but electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training CapEx needs.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nI was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about CapEx needs over the next several years. Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nYeah. No, thanks for the question. So we remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI. And as you saw, they've committed in a big way to Azure, and even in the bookings, what we recognized is just the first tranche of it. And so you'll see, given the role that we have, more benefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their success is our success because of even all the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with that announcement.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nBut your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right? We're making sure that there's the right balance between training and inference. It's geo-distributed. We are working super hard on all the software optimizations, right? I mean, not just the software optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models over the years in partnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it, and that's been key to driving, right? One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model, but if it's too expensive to serve, it's no good, right? It won't generate any demand. So you've got to have that optimization so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd so that's the fleet physics we're managing. And also, remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x. Your optimization is going to give you 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of as the training expense. So I feel very good about the investment we are making, and it's fungible, and it just allows us to scale more long-term business.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nMaybe, Carl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on CapEx because I think it's helpful to ground a bit more in what Satya is saying a fungible fleet means. We have, and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO. That is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on. And the faster we can do that, and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are, not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference, but there is some training, post-training, which is a key component. And then there's just running the commercial cloud, which at every layer under every modern AI app that's going to be built will be required. It'll be required to be distributed, and it'll be required to be global. And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd so the investment you see is making CapEx. You're right. The front end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets us really catch up, not just on the AI infrastructure we needed. Think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do on the commercial cloud side. And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue, and it'll be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others. And so I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the CapEx growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Carl. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brad Zellnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you very much for taking my question, and I'll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as well. Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer requirements out there? Thanks.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nNo, thanks, Brad, for the question. In fact, you saw us make two announcements recently. One is on the M365 Copilot side. We now have Copilot Chat. So this is now going to be broadly deployed across the entire install base, effectively, because you can go have this now turned on by IT, and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right away.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd it has Copilot Studio built in, and so that means they can start building agents. So we think of that, plus the full Copilot as a good combination that I think will accelerate, quite frankly, in terms of just seat usage and agent building and what have you. So that's sort of one. And the other thing is you also see even on the consumer side, we just yesterday launched o1, the Think Harder feature on Copilot now that's powered by o1. It's available globally, right? So you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost coming down means you can drive more ubiquity of what were features that once were sort of premium tier. And that's all definitely something that we will do across, right? The same thing is happening in GitHub Copilot, same thing in Security Copilot. So across the length and breadth of our portfolio, you'll see that.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Rebeck with Stifel. Please proceed.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThat's great. Thank you very much. Satya, if you look at several years, any sense of what % of inference done on Azure will be done on proprietary models versus open models? And with that said, does it matter to Microsoft at the end of the day? Thanks.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nYeah, it's a good question because at some level, what you're seeing is effectively lots of models that get used in any application, right? When you look underneath even a Copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what have you, you already see lots of many different models.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nYou build models, you fine-tune models, you distill models. Some of them are models that you distill into an open-source model. So there's going to be a combination. So we've always maintained that it's always good to have frontier models. You want to always build your application with high ambition using the best model that is available and then optimize from there on. So that's also another side. There's a temporality to it, right? What you start with as a given COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency and COGS and putting in different models.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nIn fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So one of the things that we are investing heavily on is Foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with these flurry of models that are coming in, and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to benefit from all that innovation, but not have all the dev cost or the dev ops cost or what people talk about AI ops cost. So we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to benefit from all these different models, open-source, closed-source, different weight classes. And at the same time, from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you . Great. Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOh, wonderful. Thank you so much. Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength. Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof of concept to departmental deals, maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise? And you mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that confidence that that will ramp into monetization later. Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nYeah. I mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in immediate productivity, a sales team, in finance or in supply chain where there is a lot of, for example, SharePoint-grounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web data and have it produce results that are beneficial.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nBut then what's happening, very much like what we've seen in these previous generation productivity things, is that people collaborate across functions, across roles, right? For example, even in my own daily habit, I go to chat, I use work tab, I get results, and then I immediately share using pages with colleagues. I sort of call it think with AI and work with people.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd that pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard issue across the enterprise. And so that's what we're seeing. It starts maybe at a departmental level. Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across. You can do it by cohort and what have you. And so what we've made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat plus this. And so that gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have something that's more ubiquitous.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nWonderful. Thank you so much.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd the last question will come from the line of Brent Braceland with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThank you for the good question here. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to commercial bookings. Commercial RPO, I think, increased $39 billion sequentially. That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis. Commercial bookings growth, 75% constant currency.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThat's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade.I appreciate there's some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Brent. It's a great question. We talked a little bit about one of the main drivers, which was one of the Azure commitments that OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, while that is obviously a big component, you'll continue to see OpenAI make commitments. So I want to separate the concept that it's one time versus an ongoing relationship that'll grow as they grow, which it absolutely will.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nAnd to your question on what else is participating in that number, first, we did have very good core motions. Our core motions are things like, to your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-ons to those contracts, upsells, like for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes. And I think that's important. We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about suite momentum. And we saw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about. And then the final component is large Azure commitments. And those really did look as we expected, which is good. To your point, in that you're seeing a really broad-based growth, those Azure commitments take two forms.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nOne, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are making larger commitments, which is a good commitment sign for the platform. And then you have new customers making commitments. And we also saw that this quarter. And so to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think it's just one thing. I think you're right. Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently across the workloads.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nCouple of color. Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you. Thank you all.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (CEO)\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",
