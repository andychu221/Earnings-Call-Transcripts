      "content": "**Operator**\nGreetings and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2026 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press *0 on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Neilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, we will provide an earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed Outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThey are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website. Today's call is being recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nYou can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made in this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong start to our fiscal year. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $49 billion, up 26% year over year, and our commercial RPO increased over 50% to nearly $400 billion with a weighted average duration of only two years. We are seeing increasing demand and diffusion of our AI platform and family of Copilots, which is fueling our investments across both capital and talent. When it comes to infrastructure, we're building a planet-scale cloud and an AI factory, maximizing tokens per dollar per watt while supporting the sovereignty needs of customers and countries. We're innovating rapidly across the family of Copilots, spanning the high-value domains of information work, coding, security, science, health, and consumer.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAs you saw yesterday, we closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, marking the next chapter in what is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has ever seen. This is a great milestone for both companies, and we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth across multiple dimensions. Already, we have roughly 10x our investment. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services. Our rev share, exclusive IP rights, and API exclusivity for Azure continue until AGI or through 2030, and we have extended the model and product IP rights through 2032. We are also energized to innovate and pursue AI advancements with both talent and compute investments that have real-world impact. With that, let's turn to our momentum across our AI platform and Copilots, as well as with agents.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe have the most expansive data center fleet for the AI era, and we are adding capacity at an unprecedented scale. We will increase our total AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next two years, reflecting the demand signals we see. Just this quarter, we announced the world's most powerful AI data center, Fairwater in Wisconsin, which will go online next year and scale to 2 gigawatts alone. We have deployed the world's first large-scale cluster of NVIDIA GB300s. We are building a fungible, global fleet that's being continuously modernized and spans all stages of the AI lifecycle, from pre-training to post-training to synthetic data generation and inference. It also goes beyond Gen AI workloads to recommendation engines, databases, and streaming. We're optimizing this fleet across silicon, systems, and software to maximize performance and efficiency.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt's this combination of fungibility and continuous optimization that allows us to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and our customers. For example, during the quarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4-1 and GPT-5, two of the most widely used models, by over 30% per GPU. We also have the most comprehensive digital sovereignty platform. Azure customers in 33 countries are now developing their own cloud and AI capabilities within their borders to meet local data residency requirements. In Germany, for example, OpenAI and SAP will rely on Azure to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector. On top of this infrastructure, we're building Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and agents. We have 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 500.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe offer developers and enterprise access to over 11,000 models, more than any other vendor, including, as of this quarter, OpenAI's GPT-5, as well as xAI's Grok-4. For example, Ralph Lauren used Foundry to build a conversational shopping experience in its app, enabling customers to describe what they're looking for and get personalized recommendations. Open Evidence used Foundry to create its AI-powered clinical assistant, which surfaces relevant medical information to physicians and helps streamline charting. When it comes to our first-party models, we're excited by the performance of our new MAI models for text, voice, and image generation, which debuted among the top in the industry leaderboards. We continue to make great progress with our Phi-3 family of SLMs, which now have been downloaded over 60 million times, up 3x YoY.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nBeyond models in Foundry, we are providing everything developers need to design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Our new Microsoft Agent Framework helps developers orchestrate multi-agent systems with compliance, observability, and deep integration out of the box. For example, KPMG used the framework to modernize the audit process, connecting agents to internal data with enterprise-grade governance and observability. These kinds of real production-scale AI deployments are driving Azure's overall growth, and once again, this quarter, Azure took share. Now let's turn to applications and agents we ourselves are building on this platform. We now have 900 million monthly active users of our AI features across our products. Our first-party family of Copilots now has surpassed 150 million monthly active users across information work, coding, security, science, health, and consumer. When it comes to information work, we continue to innovate with Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nCopilot is becoming the UI for the Agentic AI experience. We have integrated chat and Agentic workflows into everyday tools like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams. Just nine months since release, tens of millions of users across the Microsoft 365 customer base are already using chat. Adoption is accelerating rapidly, growing 50% quarter over quarter, and we continue to see usage intensity increase. This quarter, we also introduced Agent Mode, which turns single prompts into expert-quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and then iterates to deliver the final product, much like Agent Mode in coding tools today. We're thrilled by the early response, including third-party benchmarks that rank it best in class. Beyond individual productivity, Copilot is multiplayer with Teams Mode announced this week.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou can now invite colleagues into a Copilot conversation, and our collaborative agents like Facilitator and Project Manager prep meeting agendas, take notes, capture decisions, and kick off group tasks. We are seeing a growing Copilot agent ecosystem with top ISVs like Adobe, Asana, Jira, LexisNexis, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake, and Workday all building their own agents that connect to Copilot. Customers are also building agents for their mission-critical business processes and workflows using tools like Copilot Studio and integrating them into Copilot. The overall number of agent users doubled quarter over quarter, and just yesterday, we announced App Builder, a new Copilot agent that lets anyone create and deploy task-specific apps and agents in minutes grounded in Microsoft 365 context. All this innovation is driving our momentum. Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAll up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot. Accenture, Bristol-Myers Squibb, EY Global, and the UK's Tax and Payment and Customs Authority all purchased over 15,000 seats this quarter. Lloyd’s Banking Group has deployed 30,000 seats, saving each employee an average of 46 minutes daily. A large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats. Our partner, PwC, alone added 155,000 seats this quarter and now has over 200,000 deployed across its global operations. In just six months, PwC employees interacted with Microsoft 365 Copilot over 30 million times, and they credit this agentic transformation with saving millions of hours in employee productivity. When it comes to coding, GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI pair programmer now with over 26 million users.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nFor example, tens of thousands of developers at AMD use GitHub Copilot, accepting hundreds of thousands of lines of code suggestions each month and crediting it with saving months of development time. All up, GitHub is now home to over 180 million developers, and the platform is growing at the fastest rate in its history, adding a developer every second. 80% of new developers on GitHub start with Copilot within the first week. Overall, the rise of AI coding agents is driving record usage with over 500 million pull requests merged over the past year. Just yesterday at GitHub Universe, we introduced Agent HQ. GitHub Copilot and Agent HQ are the organizing layer for all coding agents, extending the GitHub primitives like PRs, issues, and actions to coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cognition, xAI, as well as OSS and in-house models.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nGitHub now provides a single mission control to launch, manage, and review these agents, each operating from its own branch with built-in controls, observability, and governance. We're building a similar system in security with over three dozen agents in Copilot integrated across Entra, Defender, Purview, and Intune. For example, with our phishing triage agent in Defender, studies show that analysts can be up to 6.5 times more efficient in detecting malicious mails. In health, Dragon Copilot helps providers automate critical workflows. This quarter alone, we helped document over 17 million patient encounters, up nearly 5x year over year. More than 650 healthcare organizations have purchased our ambient listening tech to date, including University of Michigan Health, where over 1,000 physicians are actively using it. Finally, when it comes to AI consumer experiences, we are excited about all the progress Copilot is making, starting with Windows.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nEvery Windows 11 PC now is an AI PC. Two weeks ago, we introduced new ways to speak naturally to your computer, including a Copilot wake word. With Vision, Copilot sees what you see on your screen, and you can have a real-time conversation about it. With Action, it takes real action on your behalf, interacting with both web and desktop apps. In Edge, we are introducing first-of-its-kind AI features to automate multi-step workflows within the browser and help you pick up right where you left off. Edge now has taken share for 18 consecutive quarters. In Bing, our overview pages now include embedded conversational capabilities. We took share again in search. Daily users of our Copilot consumer app increased nearly 50% quarter over quarter. Among many updates we made last week is Groups, which turns Copilot for the first time into a shared experience.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe also are creating a great consumer subscription offer with Microsoft 365 Premium. It brings together our Office applications and advanced Copilot features with high usage limits, giving individuals the flexibility to bring their own AI to work in a secure way. Finally, in gaming, Copilot provides a voice-first immersive experience across PC, mobile, and our new Xbox Ally. Beyond our family of Copilots and AI platform, we are seeing strong momentum across the portfolio. Cloud migrations are accelerating. In data and analytics, Fabric revenue grew 60%, which is faster than any other data and analytics platform in the industry. We now have 28,000 paid Fabric customers. In databases, SQL DB hyperscale revenue was up nearly 75%, 50% in Cosmos DB. In business applications, Dynamics 365 gained share.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIn security, our end-to-end stack is now informed by 100 trillion daily signals, 1 billion monthly active users of Entra, 16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter over quarter, 40,000 Sentinel customers. We took share across all categories we serve in security. In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3 billion members. In gaming, we expanded our reach across every endpoint focused on our high-margin content and services. We launched critically acclaimed games like Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Outer Worlds 2, reaching 155 million monthly active users in Minecraft, an all-time high, and set new records for overall content and services revenue for the quarter. We also saw a great response to Xbox Ally launch two weeks ago and set new records for players on PC. In closing, our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook. I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI yesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their workloads, and together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real-world needs. Our Q1 results were not impacted by the deal signed this week. Now, on to the quarter. We delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses, demonstrating our leadership position in key markets. This quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nEarnings per share was $4.13, an increase of 23% and 21% in constant currency when adjusted for the impact of our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down slightly year over year, driven by investments in AI, including the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. This was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 commercial cloud. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud and AI engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio. Operating margins increased year over year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger than anticipated results in high-margin businesses this quarter.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWhen adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million, as interest income more than offset interest expense, which includes the interest payments related to data center finance leases. Capital expenditures were $34.9 billion, driven by growing demand for our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand, growing first-party apps and AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams, as well as continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large data center sites. Cash paid for PP&E was $19.4 billion.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAs a reminder, the difference between total CapEx and cash paid for PP&E is primarily due to finance leases, as well as the normal timing of goods received but not yet paid. Cash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. Free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion, with minimal impact from a sequential increase in CapEx, given the higher mix of finance leases. Finally, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI, as well as continued growth in the number of $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and M365.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThese results do not include any impact from the incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $392 billion and was up 51% year over year. The balance has nearly doubled over the past two years. Even with this growth, our weighted average duration has been relatively stable at approximately two years. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion ahead of expectations and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68% and down year over year due to the investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, as noted earlier. Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion and grew 17% and 14% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nM365 commercial cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency, with one point of benefit from end-period revenue recognition. Year over year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats, with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher than expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by marketing solutions. The talent solutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nDynamics 365 revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased, driven by efficiency gains in M365 commercial cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI, including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot chat. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 24% and 20% in constant currency. Operating margins increased three points year over year to 62%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, as well as improved operating leverage. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. In Azure and other cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating demand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nResults were ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations, and this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads, even as we brought more capacity online. In our on-premise server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year over year, driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year over year, as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nRevenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 6% year over year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support, as well as a benefit from inventory levels that remain elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, driven by growth in volume, as well as a continued benefit from third-party partnerships that was better than expected. In gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Against a strong prior year comparable, Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by better than expected performance from third-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year over year, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nOperating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency, and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating margins increased three points year over year to 30%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by two points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and one point in More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by one point. Starting with the total company, we expect revenue of $79.5 to $80.6 billion U.S. dollars, or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of $26.35 to $26.55 billion U.S.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\ndollars, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of $17.3 to $17.4 billion U.S. dollars, or growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality. Now, other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI's conversion to a public benefit corp and the ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, we'll provide our outlook excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is estimated to be roughly $100 million, as interest income will more than offset interest expense. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Next, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we're increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nTherefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY26 growth rate to be higher than FY25. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low expiry base, when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. We expect commercial bookings will be positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year over year, driven by the continued investments in AI, as well as the mix shift to Azure. Now to segment guidance.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $33.3 to $33.6 billion, or growth of 13% to 14%. In M365 commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter over quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products include components that can be variable due to the end-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-20s, driven by growth in ARPU. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. In Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens, with continued growth across all workloads.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $32.25 to $32.55 billion, or growth of 26% to 27%. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, as demand remains significantly ahead of the capacity we have available. While we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first-party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts, and the end-of-life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect to be capacity-constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in the year-over-year growth rates, depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from end-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits, with ongoing customers' shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be in the $13.95 to $14.45 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows 10 end of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year over year. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low double digits, down sequentially as growth rates normalize, following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nGrowth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. In Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. Hardware revenue should decline year over year. In closing, demand signals across bookings, RPO, and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected. We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent, and product innovation to capture that momentum and expand our leadership position. We remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable revenue growth for the long term. With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\n**Operator**\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your headset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Managing Director)\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on another outstanding quarter. If I'm looking at Microsoft, this is two quarters in a row. We're really seeing results that are well ahead of anybody's expectations. When we were thinking about this company a year ago or five years ago, 111% commercial bookings growth was not on anybody's bingo card, if you will. Yet the stock is underperforming the broader market. The question I have is kind of getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock, and it's something about to change. I think AGI is kind of a nomenclature or a shorthand for that. It's something that's still included in your OpenAI agreement.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Managing Director)\nSatya, when we think about AGI or we think about how application and computing architectures are changing, is there anything that you see on the horizon, whether it's AGI or something else, that could potentially change what appears to be a really strong positioning for Microsoft in the marketplace today, or that strength will perhaps weaken on a go-forward basis? Is there anything that you're worrying about in that evolution, and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nNo, thank you, Keith, for the question. Here's how I would say that I think there are two parts. We feel very, very good about even this, I would say, the new agreement that we now have with OpenAI, because I think even it just creates more certainty to all of the IP relationship we have as it relates to even this definition of AGI. Beyond that, I think your question touches on something that's pretty important, which is how are these AI systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and make a real difference and make a return for both the customers who are deploying them and obviously the providers of these systems?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nI think the best way to characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let's even say exponentially, like model version over model version, the problem is it's always going to still be jagged. I think the term people use is the jagged intelligence, even it or spiky intelligence. You may even have a capability that's fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow. What is required is, in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or the Microsoft 365 Copilot system, don't think of this as a product. Think of it as a system that in some sense smooths out those jagged edges and really helps the capability. Just to give you a flavor for it, if I am in Microsoft 365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThe good news is now an Excel spreadsheet does understand Office JS, has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is a great spreadsheet created by a good modeler. The more interesting thing is I can go into agent mode in Excel and iterate on that model, and yet it'll stay on rails. It won't go off rails. It'll be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to the analyst agent, and then it'll even make sense of it like a data analyst would of an Excel model. The reason I say all of that is because that's the type of construction that'll be needed, even when the model is magical, all-powerful. I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nOne of the fundamental things that these, whether it's GitHub, whether it's security, whether it's Microsoft 365, the three main domains we're in, we feel very, very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to help customers. By the way, that's the same thing that we're going to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. That's kind of how people will build these multi-agent systems. I feel actually pretty good about both the progress in AI. I don't think AGI, as defined at least by us in our contract, is ever going to be achieved anytime soon. I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with advances in AI models by building these systems. It's kind of the real question that needs to be well understood. I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Managing Director)\nExcellent. That's super helpful.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\n**Brent Thill** (Managing Director and Tech Sector Leader)\nThanks. Amy, on the bookings blowout, I guess many are somewhat concerned about concentration risk. I think you noted a number of $100 million contracts. Not to go into a lot of detail, can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing on that 51% RPO and 110%+ bookings growth that gives you confidence about what you're seeing in terms of the breadth and extent of some of these deals on a global basis? Thanks.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThanks, Brett. A couple of things to maybe take a step back on RPO. With a nearly $400 billion balance, we've been trying to help people understand sort of how to think about really the breadth of that. It covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. That's been a balance that we've been growing, obviously, at a good clip. What people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya is talking about around creating systems and where we're investing. If you're going to have that type of balance, and then more importantly, have the weighted average duration be two years, it means that most of that is being consumed in relatively short order. People are not consuming, and I say this broadly, unless there's value.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI think this is why we keep coming back to are we creating real-world value in our AI platforms, in our AI solutions and apps and systems. I think the way to think about RPO is it's been building across a number of customers. We're thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We're learning a ton and building leading systems because of it that are being used at scale that benefits every other customer. It's why we've tried to give a little bit more color to that RPO balance, because I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about is it long-dated? Is it coming over a long period of time? Hopefully, this is helpful for people to realize that these are contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAt that type of scale, I think that's a pretty remarkable execution.\n\n**Brent Thill** (Managing Director and Tech Sector Leader)\nThank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brett. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (SVP, Managing Director, and Senior Global Software Research Analyst)\nThank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. It's pretty amazing what you guys are doing. Satya and Amy, I'd like to ask you the number one question I receive, whether from investors or at AI conferences I attend. How much confidence do you have that the software and even the consumer internet business can monetize all the investments we're seeing globally, or frankly, are we in a bubble? In fact, Amy, what would be the factors you'd be watching for to assure that you're not overbuilding for current demand and that demand will sustain? Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nMaybe I'll start, Satya, and then you could add. Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots, because with $400 billion of RPO that's sort of short-dated, as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out the infrastructure are very high. That's for booked business today. That is not any new booked business we started trying to accomplish on October 1, right? The way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular, and as we talked about 2026, the remainder. Number one, we're pivoting toward increasingly, we talked about this, short-lived assets, both GPUs and CPUs. Again, we talk about all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building. Now, when that happens, short-lived assets generally are done to match sort of the duration of the contracts or the duration of your expectation of those contracts.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI sometimes think when people think about risk, they're not realizing that most of the lifetimes of these and the lifetimes of the contracts are very similar. When you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet and the depreciation of short-lived assets, they're actually quite matched, Mark. As you know, we have spent the past few years not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se. We were short the space or the power, is the language we use to put them in. We spent a lot of time building out that infrastructure. Now we're continuing to do that, also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we've talked about, 15 to 20 years. Over that period of time, do I have confidence that we'll need to use all of that? It is very high.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWhen I think about sort of balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPU, CPU short-lived, seeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are, and I said this now, we've been short now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch up. We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places. We're seeing usage increases in products. We are seeing new products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing usage very quickly. When people see real value, they actually commit real usage. I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be thought through completely, is that when you see these kind of demand signals and we know we're behind, we do need to spend.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWe're spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in bookings, and I feel very good about that. I have said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest in product R&D, and we're doing end-of-life replacements in the fleet. We're going to spend to make sure that happens. It's about modernization, high quality, service delivery, and meeting demand. I feel good about doing that, and I feel good that we've been able to do it so efficiently and with a growing book of business behind it.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, the only thing I would add to what Amy captured was if you sort of look out, there are two things that matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D. One is how efficient is our planet-scale token factory? I mean, that's at the end of the day what you have to do. In order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible, global fleet. It's not like we're building one data center in one region in the world that's mega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training, for RL, for data synth, what have you. Therefore, the fungibility is super important. The second thing that we're also doing is continually modernizing the fleet.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt's not like we buy one version of, say, NVIDIA and load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year you buy, you ride the Moore's Law, you continuously modernize and depreciate it. That means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-4.1 and 5.0. That's software. By the way, it's helpful on A100s. It's helpful on GB200s, and it'll be helpful on GB300s. That's the beauty of having the efficiency of the fleet. Keep improving utilization, keep improving the efficiency. That's what you do in the token factory. The other aspect, which Amy spoke to, is we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high-value domains. It's in information work. That's the Copilot system. Coding.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nI mean, I should also say one of the things I like about Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPUs compared to M365 ARPUs. It's expansive. The same thing that happened between server and cloud, like we used to always say, is it zero sum? It turned out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market. The same thing is happening in AI, because first, you could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to M365, or you could say we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expansive. Same thing with tools. I mean, tools business was not like a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one of the most expansive AI systems. We feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security. Same thing with health.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIn consumer, one of the things is it's not just about ads. It's ads plus subscriptions. That also opens up opportunity for us. When I look at the entirety of these high-value agent systems and when we look at the efficiency and fungibility of our fleet, that's what gives us the confidence to invest both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (SVP, Managing Director, and Senior Global Software Research Analyst)\nThat was pretty amazing. I really appreciate all the detail.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nOK, yeah, thank you. This one is for Amy. Amy, I certainly don't want to take you down too complex an accounting path with this question, but the investment in OpenAI that sits in other income at $4.1 billion is so large that I think the audience listening in could benefit from a little bit more color about what that is. It feels like it's so much larger than you were running through other income in prior quarters that it mustn't just be your share of the OpenAI losses. Could you just describe that and what we can expect in subsequent quarters and whether this signals any kind of accounting change? Thanks so much.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe Q1 number was not impacted at all by the new agreement that was put in place. Let me first say that. Secondly, that increased loss was all due to our percentage of losses in OpenAI's debt equity method. Just to be very clear, there is not anything there that is not the increased losses from OpenAI.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nOK, understood. Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThanks, Karl.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (Executive Director)\nThank you so much. We seem to be entering into a new era where the contractual commitments from a small number of AI natives are just incredibly large, not only in absolute terms, but sometimes relative to the size of the companies themselves. For instance, contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars that are 20 times their current revenue scale. Philosophically, how do you evaluate the ability of those companies to follow through on these commitments? How do you think about placing guardrails on customer concentration for any single entity?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, maybe I'll start, and then Amy, you can add. It goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about building first the asset itself such that it's most fungible. Then to recognize the strength of even sort of our portfolio. We have a third-party business. We have a first-party business. We have third-party also spread between enterprise, digital natives. I always felt that we need a balance there, because it may start with digital natives. They're always going to be the early adopters. You always have the hit app of the generation. Then essentially, it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting. Therefore, having over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt's great to have the hit first-party apps in the beginning, because you can build scale that then if it's fungible, and that's where the key is. You don't want to build for a digital native as if you're just doing hosting for them. You want to build. That's where I think some of the decision-making of ours is probably getting better understood. What do we say yes to? What do we say no to? I think there was a lot of confusion. Hopefully, by now, anyone who switched on would figure this out. That's, I think, one thing we're doing on the third party. The first party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes. It's not even about one hit app on our first party even.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nOur portfolio of stuff, which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us again the confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum. Remember, these assets, especially the data centers and so on, are long assets. There will be many refresh cycles for any one of these when it comes to the gear. I feel that once you think about all those dimensions, the concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nMaybe just to help with another angle of that, because I think Satya's helped a lot, when you think about concentration risk or delivering to any customer, you have to remember that because we're talking about this very large flexible fleet that can be used for anyone and for any purpose, 1P, 3P, and including our commercial cloud, by the way, which I should be quite clear on, it is pretty flexible in every regard. You have to remember that the CPU and GPU and the storage gear doesn't come into play until the contracts start happening. You're right, some of these large contracts have delivery dates over time, so you get a lot of lead time in being able to say, oh, what's the status? I think we're pretty thoughtful around what's always gone in our RPO balance and been considerate of that.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThere's always been that taken into account when we publish that bookings number and publish the RPO balance.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (Executive Director)\nThank you very much.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. I'll echo my congrats on an amazing start to the year. Amy, is there any way to quantify or frame the revenue impact of Azure being short on capacity? I appreciate the constraints you face are broad across the industry. Is there risk of workloads going elsewhere? How do you mitigate that?\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nYeah, Brad, it's a great question. It's always hard to quantify precisely what would have been the revenue impact in quarter. I would offer a way to think about it is Azure probably does bear most of the revenue impact, because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first, it's obviously the increasing usage and adoption and sales we've seen of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the usage of Copilot Chat, which we've seen very different patterns, which we're encouraged by. It's the adoption of security features. It's the GitHub momentum. When you're thinking about it, that is where, and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there first. You're all right to ask, how do I think about that?\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWe've worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure, and we've been clear on it. I would say the other two priorities that I haven't mentioned maybe as much before is also just making sure our product teams and the AI talent that we've been able to hire into the company really over the past year and a half have access also to significant capacity, because we're seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding great benefit today into products people are using today for real-world work. We are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that, as well as our product engineering teams. Yes, it does impact Azure directly. That is the place where you see that prioritization.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI think it's probably hard for me to give an exact number, but it is safe to say that the number could be higher.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Managing Director of Software Equity Research)\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Operator**\nThe last question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nThank you very much. Amy, I just wanted to congratulate you. I think you said before that it is possible to accelerate Azure growth while getting efficient margins, and you've done it. Congrats on that. I have one for you, Satya. With respect to the elephant in the room, following just being a little more direct, following up on Keith Weiss's question, there's talk that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business that was rightfully Microsoft. I'm sure that there is a different point of view here. I'm wondering if you could offer some perspective on your criteria. Is it about a certain volume of business that you wish to execute on the Microsoft paper? Or is it something broader than that?\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nI don't think maybe people fully appreciate the terminal value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts, which I think is probably being underestimated as you have a full stack and you've got the multiple vectors to monetize the databases, Foundry. To your point that you are a platform company, not just a hyperscaler, maybe that's what it is all about. Or maybe there's another story about you letting the other hyperscaler company come in from nowhere and claiming a big piece of that four to five-year puzzle. Thank you so much once again. Really appreciate it. Congratulations.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you, Kash. For us, again, it just always goes back to, I think, the core principle, which is build a fleet that is fungible across the planet and works for third-party and first-party and research. That's essentially what we have done.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWhen some demand comes in shapes that don't fit that goal, where it's too concentrated, not just by customer, by location, by type of skewing, I think Amy mentioned some very key things. When you think about the margin profile of a hyperscaler, you've got to remember there's the AI accelerator piece, but there's compute, there's storage. If all of the demand just comes for just one meter, that's really not a long-term business we want to be in. That's even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first-party stuff, because that's after all a different margin stack for us. We have to fund our own R&D and model capability, because in the long run, that's what's going to differentiate us. I look at all of those.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe sort of use all of that to make sure we are saying yes to all the demand that we want. We say no to some of the demand that may be something that we could serve, but it's not in our long-term interest. That's sort of the decision-making we've done. We feel very, very good about the decisions. In some sense, I feel even each time we say no to, the day after I feel better.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCash, maybe just.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCash, I think this is our last call with you. I just want to say thanks and congratulations. It's been a privilege to work with you, and best of luck.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nLet me add to that. Best of luck, Kash.\n\n**Kash Rangan** (Managing Director)\nThanks. Thank you so much. Very kind of you.\n\n**Jonathan Neilson** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Cash. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you all.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Nielsen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThey are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nYou can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you very much, Jonathan. This quarter, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, up 26% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our platform and accelerating demand. We are in the beginning phases of AI diffusion and its broad GDP impact. Our TAM will grow substantially across every layer of the tech stack as this diffusion accelerates and spreads. In fact, even in this early innings, we have built an AI business that is larger than some of our biggest franchises that took decades to build. Today, I'll focus my remarks across the three layers of our stack: cloud and token factory, AI and platform, and high-value agentic experiences. When it comes to our cloud and token factory, the key to long-term competitiveness is shaping our infrastructure to support new high-scale workloads.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe are building this infrastructure out for the heterogeneous and distributed nature of these workloads, ensuring the right fit with the geographic and segment-specific needs for all customers, including the long tail. The key metric we are optimizing for is tokens per watt per dollar, which comes down to increasing utilization and decreasing TCO using silicon systems and software. A good example of this is the 50% increase in throughput we were able to achieve in one of our highest volume workloads, OpenAI inferencing, powering our copilots. Another example was the unlocking of new capabilities and efficiencies for our Fairwater data centers. In this instance, we connected both Atlanta and Wisconsin site through an AI WAN to build a first-of-its-kind AI super factory. Fairwater's two-story design and liquid cooling allow us to run higher GPU densities and thereby improve both performance and latencies for high-scale training.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAll up, we added nearly 1 GW of total capacity this quarter alone. At the silicon layer, we have NVIDIA and AMD and our own Maia chips, delivering the best all-up fleet performance, cost, and supply across multiple generations of hardware. Earlier this week, we brought online our Maia 200 accelerator. Maia 200 delivers 10+ petaflops at FP4 precision with over 30% improved TCO compared to the latest generation hardware in our fleet. We will be scaling this, starting with inferencing and synthetic data gen for our super intelligence team, as well as doing inferencing for Copilot and Foundry. And given AI workloads are not just about AI accelerators, but also consume large amounts of compute, we are pleased with the progress we are making on the CPU side as well.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nCobalt 200 is another big leap forward, delivering over 50% higher performance compared to our first custom-built processor for cloud-native workloads. Sovereignty is increasingly top of mind for customers, and we are expanding our solutions and global footprint to match. We announced DC investments in seven countries this quarter alone, supporting local data residency needs. We offer the most comprehensive set of sovereignty solutions across public, private, and national partner clouds, so customers can choose the right approach for each workload with the local control they require. Next, I want to talk about the agent platform. Like in every platform shift, all software is being rewritten. A new app platform is being born.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou can think of agents as the new apps, and to build, deploy, and manage agents, customers will need a model catalog, tuning services, harness for orchestration, services for context engineering, AI safety, management, observability, and security. It starts with having broad model choice. Our customers expect to use multiple models as part of any workload that they can fine-tune and optimize based on cost, latency, and performance requirements. We offer the broadest selection of models of any hyperscaler. This quarter, we added support for GPT-5 too, as well as Claude 4.5. Already, over 1,500 customers have used both Anthropic and OpenAI models on Foundry. We are seeing increasing demand for region-specific models, including Mistral and Cohere, as more customers look for sovereign AI choices.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe continue to invest in our first-party models, which are optimized to address the highest value customer scenarios, such as productivity, coding, and security. As part of Foundry, we also give customers the ability to customize and fine-tune models. Increasingly, customers want to be able to capture the tacit knowledge they possess inside of model weights as their core IP. This is probably the most important sovereign consideration for firms as AI diffuses more broadly across our GDP, and every firm needs to protect their enterprise value. For agents to be effective, they need to be grounded in enterprise data and knowledge. That means connecting their agents to systems of record and operational data, analytical data, as well as semi-structured and unstructured productivity and communications data. And this is what we are doing with our Unified IQ layer, spanning Fabric, Foundry, and data powering Microsoft 365.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIn the world of context engineering, Foundry Knowledge and Fabric are gaining momentum. Foundry Knowledge delivers better context with automated source routing and advanced agentic retrieval while respecting user permissions. Fabric brings together end-to-end operational, real-time, and analytical data. Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion, with over 31,000 customers, and it continues to be the fastest-growing analytics platform on the market, with revenue up 60% year-over-year. All up, the number of customers spending $1 million plus per quarter on Foundry grew nearly 80%, driven by strong growth in every industry. Over 250 customers are on track to process over 1 trillion tokens on Foundry this year. There are many great examples of customers using all of this capability on Foundry to build their own agentic systems.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAlaska Airlines is creating natural language flight search, BMW is speeding up design cycles, Land O'Lakes is enabling precision farming for co-op members, and SymphonyAI is addressing bottlenecks in the CPG industry. And of course, Foundry remains a powerful on-ramp for the entire cloud. The vast majority of Foundry customers use additional Azure solutions like developer services, app services, databases as they scale. Beyond Fabric and Foundry, we are also addressing agent building by knowledge workers with Copilot Studio and Agent Builder. Over 80% of the Fortune 500 have active agents built using these low-code, no-code tools. As agents proliferate, every customer will need new ways to deploy, manage, and protect them. We believe this creates a major new category and significant growth opportunity for us.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThis quarter, we introduced Agent 365, which makes it easy for organizations to extend their existing governance, identity, security, and management to agents. That means the same controls they already use across Microsoft 365 and Azure now extend to agents they build and deploy on our cloud or any other cloud. And partners like Adobe, Databricks, Genspark, Glean, NVIDIA, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday are already integrating Agent 365. We are the first provider to offer this type of agent control plane across clouds. Now, let's turn to the high-value agentic experiences we are building. AI experiences are intent-driven and are beginning to work at task scope. We are entering an age of macro delegation and micro steering across domains. Intelligence using multiple models is built into multiple form factors.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou see this in chat, in new agent inbox apps, coworker scaffoldings, agent workflows embedded in applications and IDEs that are used every day, or even in our command line with file system access and skills. That's the approach we are taking with our first-party family of Copilot spanning key domains. In consumer, for example, Copilot experiences span chat, news, feed, search, creation, browsing, shopping, and integrations into the operating system, and it's gaining momentum. Daily users of our Copilot app increased nearly 3x year-over-year, and with Copilot Checkout, we have partnered with PayPal, Shopify, and Stripe so customers can make purchases directly within the app.... With Microsoft 365 Copilot, we are focused on organization-wide productivity. Work IQ takes the data underneath Microsoft 365 and creates the most valuable stateful agent for every organization.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nIt delivers powerful reasoning capabilities over people, their roles, their artifacts, their communications, and their history and memory, all within an organization's security boundary. Microsoft 365 Copilot's accuracy and latency, powered by Work IQ, is unmatched, delivering faster and more accurate work-grounded results than competition. We have seen our biggest quarter-over-quarter improvement in response quality to date. This has driven record usage intensity, with average number of conversations per user doubling year-over-year. Microsoft 365 Copilot also is becoming true daily habit, with daily active users increasing 10x year-over-year. We are also seeing strong momentum with Researcher Agent, which supports both OpenAI and Claude, as well as agent mode in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. All up, it was a record quarter for Microsoft 365 Copilot seat adds, up over 160% year-over-year.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe saw accelerating seat growth quarter-over-quarter, and now have 15 million paid Microsoft 365 Copilot seats and multiples more enterprise chat users. We are seeing larger commercial deployments. The number of customers with over 35,000 seats tripled year-over-year. Fiserv, ING, NASA, University of Kentucky, University of Manchester, US Department of Interior, and Westpac all purchased over 35,000 seats. Publicis alone purchased over 95,000 seats for nearly all its employees. We are also taking share in Dynamics 365 with built-in agents across the entire suite. A great example of this is how Visa is turning customer conversations data into knowledge articles with our Customer Knowledge Management Agent in Dynamics, and how Sandvik is using our Sales Qualification Agent to automate lead qualification across tens and thousands of potential customers. In coding, we are seeing strong growth across all paid GitHub Copilot.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nCopilot Pro plus subs for individual devs increased 77% quarter-over-quarter, and all up now, we have 4.7 million paid Copilot subscribers, up 75% year-over-year. Siemens, for example, is going all in on GitHub, adopting the full platform to increase developer productivity after a successful Copilot rollout to 30,000+ developers. GitHub Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agents like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI in the context of customers' GitHub repos. With Copilot CLI and VS Code, we offer developers the full spectrum of form factors and models they need for AI-first coding workflows. And when you add Work IQ as a skill or an MCP to our developer workflow, it's a game changer, surfacing more context like emails, meetings, docs, projects, messages, and more.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYou can simply ask the agent to plan and execute changes to your code base based on an update to a spec in SharePoint or using the transcript of your last engineering and design meeting in Teams. We are going beyond that with GitHub Copilot SDK. Developers can now embed the same runtime behind Copilot CLI, multi-model, multi-step planning tools, MCP integration, auth, streaming directly into their applications. In security, we added a dozen new and updated Security Copilot agents across Defender, Entra, Intune, and Purview. For example, Icertis's SOC team used Security Copilot agent to reduce manual triage time by 75%, which is a real game changer in an industry facing a severe talent shortage.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nTo make it easier for security teams to onboard, we are rolling out Security Copilot to all our E5 customers, and our security solutions are also becoming essential to manage organizations' AI deployments. 24 billion Copilot interactions were audited by Purview this quarter, up 9x year-over-year. Finally, I want to talk about two additional high-impact agentic experiences. First, in healthcare, Dragon Copilot is the leader in its category, helping over 100,000 medical providers automate their workflows. Mount Sinai Health is now moving to a system-wide Dragon Copilot deployment for providers after a successful trial with its primary care physicians. All up, we helped document 21 million patient encounters this quarter, up 3x year-over-year. And second, when it comes to science and engineering, companies like Unilever in consumer goods and Synopsys in EDA are using Microsoft Discovery to orchestrate specialized agents for R&D end-to-end.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThey're able to reason over scientific literature and internal knowledge, formulate hypotheses, spin up simulations, and continuously iterate to drive new discoveries. Beyond AI, we continue to invest in all our core franchises and meet the needs of our customers and partners, and we are seeing strong progress. For example, when it comes to cloud migrations, our new SQL Server has over 2x the IaaS adoption of the previous version. In security, we now have 1.6 million security customers, including over 1 million who use four or more of our workloads. Windows reached a big milestone, 1 billion Windows 11 users, up over 45% year-over-year. We had share gains this quarter across Windows, Edge, and Bing.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nDouble-digit member growth in LinkedIn with 30% growth in paid video ads. In gaming, we are committed to delivering great games across Xbox, PC, Cloud, and every other device, and we saw record PC players and paid streaming hours on Xbox. In closing, we feel very good about how we are delivering for customers today and building the full stack to capture the opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. With growing demand for our offerings and focused execution by our sales teams, we again exceeded expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share while investing to fuel long-term growth. This quarter, revenue was $81.3 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 14% in constant currency, while operating income increased 21% and 19% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $4.14, an increase of 24% and 21% in constant currency when adjusted for the impact from our investment in OpenAI. FX increased reported results slightly less than expected, particularly in Intelligent Cloud revenue.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCompany gross margin percentage was 68%, down slightly year-over-year, primarily driven by continued investments in AI infrastructure and growing AI product usage that was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial Cloud, as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by R&D investments in compute capacity and AI talent, as well as impairment charges in our gaming business. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 47% ahead of expectations. As a reminder, we still account for our investment in OpenAI under the equity method, and as a result of OpenAI's recapitalization, we now record gains or losses based on our share of the change in their net assets on their balance sheet, as opposed to our share of their operating profit or losses from their income statement.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nTherefore, we recorded a gain which drove other income and expense to $10 billion in our GAAP results. When adjusted for the OpenAI impact, other income and expense was slightly negative and lower than expected, driven by net losses on investments. Capital expenditures were $37.5 billion, and this quarter, roughly two-thirds of our CapEx was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs. Our customer demand continues to exceed our supply. Therefore, we must balance the need to have our incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand with expanding first-party AI usage across services like M365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, increasing allocations to R&D teams to accelerate product innovation, and continued replacement of end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThis quarter, total finance leases were $6.7 billion and were primarily for large data center sites, and cash paid for PP&E was $29.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $35.8 billion, up 60%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $5.9 billion and decreased sequentially, reflecting the higher cash capital expenditures from a lower mix of finance leases. Finally, we returned $12.7 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases, an increase of 32% year-over-year. Now to our commercial results.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nCommercial bookings increased 230% and 228% in constant currency, driven by the previously announced large Azure commitment from OpenAI that reflects multiyear demand needs, as well as the previously announced Anthropic commitment from November and healthy growth across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation, which continues to be reported net of reserves, increased to $625 billion and was up 110% year-over-year, with a weighted average duration of approximately 2.5 years. Roughly 25% will be recognized in revenue in the next twelve months, up 39% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next twelve months, increased 156%. Approximately 45% of our commercial RPO balance is from OpenAI.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe significant remaining balance grew 28% and reflects ongoing broad customer demand across the portfolio. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $51.5 billion and grew 26% and 24% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 67% and down year over year due to continued investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $34.1 billion and grew 16% and 14% in constant currency. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, with consistent execution in the core business and increasing contribution from strong Copilot results.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nARPU growth was again led by E5 and M365 Copilot, and paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year to over 450 million, with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 13% and 10% in constant currency ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 29% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth…. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 6%. LinkedIn revenue increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, driven by marketing solutions. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 17% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased, again, driven by efficiency gains at M365 Commercial Cloud that were partially offset by continued investments in AI, including the impact of growing Copilot usage. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 22% and 19% in constant currency. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 60%, driven by improved operating leverage, as well as the higher gross margins noted earlier. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $32.9 billion and grew 29% and 28% in constant currency.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, with ongoing efficiency gains across our fungible fleet, enabling us to reallocate some capacity to Azure that was monetized in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, we continued to see strong demand across workloads, customer segments, and geographic regions, and demand continues to exceed available supply. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, including a benefit from the launch of SQL Server 2025, as well as higher transactional purchasing ahead of memory price increases. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year, driven by continued investments in AI and sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nOperating expenses increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, and operating income grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. Operating margins were 42%, down slightly year-over-year, as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.3 billion and declined 3%. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Windows OEM grew 5% with strong execution, as well as a continued benefit from Windows 10 end of support. Results were ahead of expectations as inventory levels remained elevated, with increased purchasing ahead of memory price increases. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly below expectations, driven by some execution challenges. As expected, the sequential growth rate moderated as the benefit from third-party partnerships normalized.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn gaming, revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency and was below expectations, driven by first-party content with impact across the platform. Segment gross margin dollars increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, driven by the impairment charges in our gaming business noted earlier, as well as R&D investments in compute capacity and AI talent. Operating income decreased 3% and 4% in constant currency, and operating margins were relatively unchanged year-over-year at 27%, as higher operating expenses were mostly offset by higher gross margins. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nBased on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by three points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by four points in Productivity and Business Processes and two points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by two points. As a reminder, this impact is due to the exchange rates a year ago. Starting with the total company, we expect revenue of $80.65 billion-$81.75 billion, or growth of 15%-17%, with continued strong growth across our commercial businesses, partially offset by our consumer businesses.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nWe expect COGS of $26.65 billion-$26.85 billion, or growth of 22%-23%, and operating expense of $17.8 billion-$17.9 billion, or growth of 10%-11%, driven by continued investment in R&D, AI compute capacity, and talent against a low prior year comparable. Operating margins should be down slightly year-over-year. Excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense is expected to be roughly $700 million, driven by a fair market gain in our equity portfolio and interest income, partially offset by interest expense, which includes the interest payments related to data center finance leases. We expect our adjusted Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nNext, we expect capital expenditures to decrease on a sequential basis due to the normal variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. As we work to close the gap between demand and supply, we expect the mix of short-lived assets to remain similar to Q2. Now, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a growing ex-pre base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. As a reminder, the significant OpenAI contract signed in Q2 represents multiyear demand needs from them, which will result in some quarterly volatility in both bookings and RPO growth rates going forward. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 65%, down year-over-year, driven by continued investments in AI. Now to segment guidance.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $34.25 billion-$34.55 billion, or growth of 14%-15%. In M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13%-14% in constant currency, with continued stability in year-over-year growth rates on a large and expanding base. Accelerating Copilot momentum and ongoing E5 adoption will again drive ARPU growth. M365 Commercial Products revenue should decline in the low single digits, down sequentially, assuming Office 2024 transactional purchasing trends normalize. As a reminder, M365 Commercial Products include components that can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid- to high-20% range, driven by growth at ARPU, as well as continued subscription volume.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nFor LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth to be in the low double digits, and in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens, with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $34.1 billion-$34.4 billion, or growth of 27%-29%. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 37% and 38% in constant currency against a prior year comparable that included significantly accelerating growth rates in both Q3 and Q4. As mentioned earlier, demand continues to exceed supply, and we will need to continue to balance the incoming supply we can allocate here against other priorities.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAs a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as growth rates normalize following the launch of SQL Server 2025. Though increased memory pricing could create additional volatility in transactional purchasing. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.3 billion-$12.8 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low teens. Growth rates will be impacted as the benefit from Windows 10 end of support normalizes and as elevated inventory levels come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline roughly 10%.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal, in part due to the potential impact on the PC market from increased memory pricing. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high single digits. Even as we work to improve execution, we expect continued share gains across Bing and Edge, with growth driven by volume, and we expect sequential growth moderation as the contribution from third-party partnerships continues to normalize. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited from strong content performance, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass, and hardware revenue should decline year-over-year. Now, some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nBased on current rates, we expect FX to increase Q4 total revenue and COGS growth by less than 1 point, with no impact to operating expense growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 1 point in Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing and less than 1 point in Intelligent Cloud. With the strong work delivered in H1 to prioritize investment in key growth areas and the favorable impact from a higher mix of revenue in our Windows OEM and commercial on-prem businesses, we now expect FY 2026 operating margins to be up slightly. We mentioned the potential impact on Windows OEM and on-premises server markets from increased memory pricing earlier. In addition, rising memory prices would impact capital expenditures, though the impact on Microsoft Cloud gross margins will build more gradually as these assets depreciate over six years.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIn closing, we delivered strong top-line growth in H1 and are investing across every layer of the stack to continue to deliver high-value solutions and tools to our customers. With that, let's go to Q&A. Jonathan?\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad, and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Analyst)\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. I'm looking at a Microsoft print where earnings is growing 24% year-on-year, which is a spectacular result. Great execution on your part. Top line growing well, margins expanding. But I'm looking at after-hours trading, and the stock is still down. And I think one of the core issues that is weighing on investors is CapEx is growing faster than we expected, and maybe Azure is growing a little bit slower than we expected. And I think that fundamentally comes down to a concern on the ROI on this CapEx spend over time. So I was hoping you guys could help us fill in some of the blanks a little bit in terms of how should we think about capacity expansion and what that can yield in terms of Azure growth going forward?\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Analyst)\nMore to the point, how should we think about the ROI on this investment as it comes to fruition? Thanks, guys.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\n... Thanks, Keith. And let me start, and Satya can add some broader comments, I'm sure. I think the first thing, I think you really asked a very direct correlation that I do think many investors are doing, which is between the CapEx spend and seeing an Azure revenue number. And, you know, we tried last quarter, and I think again this quarter, to talk more specifically about all the places that the CapEx spend, especially the short-lived CapEx spend across CPU and GPU, and where that'll show up. Sometimes I think it's probably better to think about the Azure guidance that we give as an allocated capacity guide about what we can deliver in Azure revenue. Because as we spend the capital and put GPUs specifically, it applies to CPUs, but GPUs more specifically, we're really making long-term decisions.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe first thing we're doing is solving for the increased usage in sales and the accelerating pace of M365 Copilot, as well as GitHub Copilot, our first-party apps. Then we make sure we're investing in the long-term nature of R&D and product innovation. And much of the acceleration that I think you've seen from us in products over the past bit is coming because we are allocating GPUs and capacity to many of the talented AI people we've been hiring over the past years. You end up with the remainder going towards serving the Azure capacity that continues to grow in terms of demand.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nA way to think about it, because I think I get asked this question sometimes, is, you know, if I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2, in terms of GPUs, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40. And I think the most important thing to realize is that this is about investing in all the layers of the stack that benefit customers, and I think that's hopefully helpful in terms of thinking about capital growth. It shows in every piece. It shows in revenue growth across the business and shows as OpEx growth as we invest in our people.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, I think you, Amy, covered it. But basically, as an investor, I think when you think about our capital, and you think about the GM profile of our portfolio, you should obviously think about Azure, but you should think about M365 Copilot, and you should think about GitHub Copilot. You should think about Dragon Copilot, Security Copilot. All of those have a GM profile and lifetime value. I mean, if you think about it, acquiring an Azure customer is super important to us, but so is acquiring an M365 or a GitHub or a Dragon Copilot, which are all, by the way, incremental businesses and TAMs for us. And so we don't want to maximize just one business of ours.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWe want to be able to allocate capacity while we're sort of supply constrained in a way that allows us to essentially build the best LTV portfolio. That's on one side, and the other one that Amy mentioned is also R&D. I mean, you got to think about compute is also R&D, and that's sort of the second element of it. And so we're using all of that, obviously, to optimize for the long term.\n\n**Keith Weiss** (Analyst)\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (Analyst)\nThank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. One of the other questions we believe investors want to understand is how to think about your line of sight from hardware CapEx investment to revenue and margins. You capitalize servers over six years, but the average duration of your RPO is 2.5 years, up from two years last quarter. How do investors get comfortable that since this is a lot of this CapEx is AI-centric, that you'll be able to capture sufficient revenue over the 6-year useful life of the hardware to deliver solid revenue and gross profit dollars growth? Hopefully, one similar to the CPU revenue. Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThanks, Mark. Let me start with at a high level, and Satya can add as well. I think, you know, when you think about average duration, I think what you're getting to is, and we need to remember, is that average duration is a combination of a broad set of contract arrangements that we have. A lot of them around things like M365 or our BizApp portfolio are shorter dated, right? Three-year contracts, and so they have, quite frankly, a short duration. The majority then, that's remaining are Azure contracts that are longer duration, and you saw that this quarter when we saw the extension of that duration from around 2 years to 2.5.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe way to think about that is, you know, the majority of the capital that we're spending today, and a lot of the GPUs that we're buying, are already contracted for most of their useful life. So a way to think about that is, you know, much of that risk that I think you're pointing to isn't there because they're already sold for the entirety of their useful life. So part of it exists because you have this shorter dated RPO because of some of the M365 stuff. If you look at the Azure-only RPO, it's a little bit more extended. A lot of that is CPU basis. It's not just GPU.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nOn the GPU contracts that we've talked about, including for some of our largest customers, those are sold for the entire useful life of the GPU, and so there's not the risk to which I think you may be referring. Hopefully, that's helpful.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\n... Yeah, and just one other thing I would add, to it is, in addition to sort of what Amy mentioned, which is it's already contracted for the useful life, is we do use software to continuously run even the latest models on, the fleet, that is aging, if you will. So that's sort of what gives us that duration. And so, at the end of the day, we want to have— That's why we even think about aging the fleet constantly, right? So it's not about buying a whole lot of gear one year. It's about each year you ride the Moore's Law, you add, you use software, and then you optimize across all of it.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nAnd Mark, maybe to state this, in case it's not obvious, is that as you go through the useful life, actually, you get more and more and more efficient at its delivery. So where you've sold the entirety of its life, the margins actually improve with time. And so I think that may be a good reminder to people as we see that, obviously, in the CPU fleet all the time.\n\n**Mark Moerdler** (Analyst)\nThat's a great answer. I really appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please, please proceed.\n\n**Brent Thill** (Analyst)\nThanks, Amy. On 45% of the backlog being related to OpenAI, I'm just curious if you can comment. There's obviously concern about the, you know, the durability, and I know maybe there's not much you can say on this, but I think everyone's concerned about the exposure and if you could maybe talk through your perspective on what both you and Satya are seeing.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nI think maybe I would have thought about the question quite differently, Brent. The first thing to focus on is the reason we talked about that number is because 55% or roughly $350 billion is related to the breadth of our portfolio, a breadth of customers across solutions, across Azure, across industries, across geographies. That is a significant RPO balance, larger than most peers, more diversified than most peers, and frankly, I think we have super high confidence in it. When you think about that portion alone growing 28%, it's really impressive work on the breadth as well as the adoption curve that we're seeing, which is I think what I get asked most frequently. It's grown by customer segment, by industry, and by geo, and so it's very consistent.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nIf you're asking me about how do I feel about OpenAI and the contract and the health, listen, it's a great partnership. We continue to be their provider of scale. We're excited to do that. We sit under one of the most successful businesses built, and we continue to feel quite good about that. It's allowed us to remain a leader in terms of what we're building and being on the cutting edge of app innovation.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Analyst)\nOkay, thank you very much. Satya, Amy, regardless of how you allocate the capacity between first party and third party, can you comment qualitatively on the amount of capacity that you have coming on? I think the 1 GW added in the December quarter was extraordinary and hints that the capacity adds are accelerating. But I think a lot of investors have their eyes on Fairwater, Atlanta, Fairwater, Wisconsin, and would love some comments about the magnitude of the capacity adds, regardless of how they're allocated in the coming quarters. Thank you.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nYeah, Karl, I think we've said a couple of things. We're working as hard as we can to add capacity as quickly as we can. You've mentioned specific sites like Atlanta or Wisconsin. Those are multi-year deliveries, so I wouldn't focus necessarily on specific locations. The real thing we've got to do, and we're working incredibly hard at doing it, is adding capacity globally. A lot of that will be added in the United States, the two locations you've mentioned, but it also needs to be added across the globe to meet the customer demand that we're seeing and the increased usage. You know, we'll continue to add both long-lived assets, infrastructure.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThe way to think about that is we need to make sure we've got power and land and facilities available, and we'll continue to put GPUs and CPUs in them when they're done, as quickly as we can. And then finally, we'll try to make sure we can get as efficient as we possibly can on the pace at which we do that and how we operate them so that they can have the highest possible utility. And so I think, it's not really about, you know, two places, Karl. I, I would definitely abstract away from that. Those are multi-year delivery timelines, but really, we just need to get it done every location where we're currently in a build or, or starting to do that. We're working as quickly as we can.\n\n**Karl Keirstead** (Analyst)\nOkay, got it. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\n\n**Mark Murphy** (Analyst)\nThank you so much. Satya, the performance achievements of the Maia 200 accelerator for inference looked quite remarkable, especially in comparison to TPUs and Trainium and Blackwell, which have just been around a lot longer. Can, can you put that accomplishment in perspective, in terms of how much of a core competency you think silicon might become for Microsoft? And Amy, are there any ramifications worth mentioning there in terms of supporting your gross margin profile for inference costs going forward?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, no, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. One is we've been at this, in a variety of different forms, for a long, long time in terms of building our own silicon. And, so we're very, very thrilled about the progress with Maia 200. And, you know, especially when we think about running a GPT-5 too and the, the performance we're able to get in the GEMMs, at FP4, just proves the point that, when you have, a new workload, a new shape of a workload, you can start innovating end-to-end, between the model and, and, and the silicon. And the entire system is just not even about just the silicon, the way, the networking works at, at rack scale that's optimized, with memory for, this particular workload.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThe other thing is we are obviously round-tripping and working very closely with our own super intelligence team with all of our models. As you can imagine, whatever we build will be all optimized for Maia. We feel great about it, and I think the way to think about all up is we're in such early innings. I mean, even just look at the amount of silicon innovation and systems innovation. Even since December, I think the new thing is everybody's talking about low latency inference. Right? One of the things we want to make sure is we're not locked into any one thing. If anything, we have great partnership with NVIDIA, with AMD. They're innovating, we're innovating. We want to fleet at any given point in time to have access to the best TCO.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nAnd it's not a one-generation game. I think a lot of folks just talk about who's ahead. It's just remember, you have to be ahead all the—for all time to come. And that means you really want to think about, you know, having a lot of innovation that happens out there to be in your fleet so that your fleet is fundamentally advantaged at the TCO level. So that's kind of how I look at it, which is we are excited about Maia, we're excited about Cobalt, we're excited about DPU, our next. So we have a lot of systems capability. That means we can vertically integrate, and because we can vertically integrate doesn't mean we just only vertically integrate. And so we want to be able to have the flexibility here, and that's what you see us do.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you very much. Satya, we heard a lot about frontier transformations from Judson at Ignite, and we've seen customers realize breakthrough benefits when they adopt the Microsoft AI stack. Can you help frame for us the momentum in enterprises embarking on these journeys, and any expectation for how much their spend with Microsoft can expand in becoming frontier firms? Thanks.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, thank you for that. So I think, one of the things that we are seeing, is the adoption across the three major suites of ours, right? So if you take M365, you take, what's happening with security, and you take GitHub. In fact, it's, it's fascinating. I mean, you know, these three things had effectively compounding effects for our customers in the past, like something like Entra as an identity system or Defender as the protection system, across all three was sort of super helpful. But so what now you're seeing is something like Work IQ, right? So, I mean, just to give you a flavor for it, the most important database underneath, for any company that uses Microsoft today is the data underneath Microsoft 365, and the reason is because it has all this tacit information, right? Who are your people?\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nWhat are their relationships? What are the projects they're working on? What are their artifacts, their communications? So that's a super important asset for any business process, business workflow context. In fact, the scenario I even had in my transcript around, you can now take Work IQ as an MCP server and, you know, GitHub repo and say, \"Hey, please look at my design meetings for the last month in Teams and tell me if my repo reflects it.\" I mean, that's a pretty high-level way to think about how what is happening previously, perhaps with our tools business and our GitHub business, are suddenly now being transformative, right? That agentic plane is really transforming companies in some sense, right? That's, I think, the most magical thing, which is you deploy these things, and suddenly the agents are helping you coordinate, bring more leverage to your enterprise.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThen on top of it, of course, there is the transformation, which is what businesses are doing. How should we think about customer service? How should we think about marketing? How should we think about finance? How should we think about that and build our own agents? That's where all the services in Fabric and Foundry, and of course, the GitHub tooling is helping them, or even the low-code, no-code tools. I had some stats on how much that's being used. But one of the more exciting things for me is these new agents systems, M365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot, all coming together to compound the benefits of all the data and all the deployment. I think is probably the most transformative effect right now.\n\n**Brad Zelnick** (Analyst)\nThank you. Very helpful.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Operator**\nThe last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Analyst)\n... Perfect. Thanks for squeezing me in. The last few quarters, we talked, besides the GPU side, we talked about CPU as well on the Azure side, and you had some operational changes at the beginning, or January last year. Can you speak what you saw there, and maybe put it more in a bigger picture in terms of clients realizing that their move to the cloud is important if they want to deliver proper AI? So, what are we seeing in terms of cloud transitions? Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nI didn't quite-\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nSorry, Raimo, you were asking about the SMC, CPU side, or can you just repeat the question, please?\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Analyst)\nYeah. Yeah, yeah, yes, sorry. So I was wondering about the CPU side of Azure, because we had some operational changes there. You know, we also hear from the field a lot that people are realizing they need to be in the cloud if they want to do proper AI, and if that's kind of driving momentum. Thank you.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nYeah, I think I get it. So first of all, I had mentioned in my remarks that when you think about AI workloads, you shouldn't think of AI workloads as just AI accelerator compute, right? Because in some sense, it takes any agent, the agent will then spawn through tool use maybe a container, which runs obviously on compute. In fact, we have whenever we think about even the building out of the fleet, we think of in ratios. Even for a training job, by the way, an AI training job requires a bunch of compute and a bunch of storage, very close to compute, and so therefore, and in same thing in inferencing as well. So in inferencing with agent mode, would require you to essentially provision a computer, or computing resources to the agent.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThey don't need GPUs. They're running on GPUs, but they need computers, which are compute and storage. So that's what's happening even in the new workload. The other thing you mentioned is the cloud migrations are still going on. In fact, one of the stats I had was SQL latest SQL Server growing as an IaaS service in Azure. And so that's one of the reasons why we have to think about our commercial cloud and keep it balanced with the rest of our AI cloud, because when clients bring their workloads and bring new workloads, they need all of these infrastructure elements in the region in which they're deploying.\n\n**Raimo Lenschow** (Analyst)\nYeah. Okay, perfect. Thank you.\n\n**Jonathan Nielsen** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Raimo. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.\n\n**Satya Nadella** (Chairman and CEO)\nThank you all.\n\n**Amy Hood** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation. Have a great night.",
