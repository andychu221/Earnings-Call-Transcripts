We ended calendar year 2025 on a strong note, delivering December quarter revenues ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margins, operating margins, and EPS all exceeded the high end of the range. Our performance demonstrates continued strong execution in an accelerating semiconductor demand environment. At our Investor Day event last year, we outlined our tremendous opportunity to expand our market and gain share at every successive technology node. Vertical scaling of device and packaging architectures is driving higher deposition and etch intensity and moving the market to our strengths. The vision we shared was to more than double Lam's revenue and profit over the next 5 years. Today, we are well on our way.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nWith the industry ramping capacity and adopting new technologies to meet the demands of the AI transformation, Lam's deposition and etch capabilities are proving to be key enablers in the transition to gate-all-around transistors, backside power deposition, high-performance materials, and 3D advanced packaging. We prepared for this moment, launching an array of new products and advanced services targeted at broadening our exposure across DRAM, leading-edge foundry logic, and NAND. We've also invested in expanding our manufacturing and R&D footprint to increase operational velocity in response to strong customer demand. In 2025, we achieved record revenues of more than $20 billion and expanded our served available market, or SAM, share of WFE into the mid-30s% range. This marks solid progress toward our multi-year goal of being in the high 30s.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nOur ship share of WFE grew by well over 1 percentage point year-on-year, and our CSPG business hit key milestones, with the size of our installed base topping 100,000 chambers and revenue growing faster than the increase in installed base units. We are proud of these accomplishments, but there's even more to come. The AI transformation is driving industry spending higher. In 2025, WFE came in close to $110 billion. Our initial 2026 view is for WFE to be in the $135 billion range, with the growth in spending remaining constrained by a shortage of available clean room space. Chipmakers have been public about their efforts to alleviate constraints, but they've also commented on sold-out conditions persisting, indicating the magnitude of the challenge.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nWe expect WFE this year to be weighted to the second half, with robust growth in investments across all three device segments, led by DRAM and leading-edge foundry logic. All indications are that we are still in the early stages of the AI build-out. End markets are signaling a strong appetite for greater compute and storage capability at both the device and package level. In foundry logic, customers are accelerating migration to nodes employing gate-all-around transistors. If you recall, we previously said that the transition to gate-all-around equates to roughly $1 billion in incremental Lam SAM for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. Given the 3D nature of gate-all-around structures, we are well positioned with our deposition and etch portfolio to gain share within this segment. In addition, customers are integrating more functionalities with advanced packaging.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nWe previously estimated advanced packaging would make up a mid-single-digit percentage of overall foundry logic equipment spend. As additional devices, including those for mobile applications, adopt more complex packaging schemes, we see this number moving higher. In high bandwidth memory, or HBM, advanced packaging is critical for the transition to HBM4 and HBM4E, and stacking of up to 16 layers. Lam is in an excellent position, given our market leadership in electroplating and TSV etch. We expect our overall advanced packaging business to grow more than 40% in 2026, outperforming our view of WFE growth in this space. Finally, in NAND, demand is growing faster than previously expected, as new use cases for high-capacity SSDs emerge. Non-volatile context memory layers that enable large-scale in-AI inference have the potential to add incremental growth in NAND bit demand.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nFor every 2-3 million accelerators sold, we estimate an incremental 1-point increase in overall NAND bit demand growth. Lam has the industry's largest installed base of NAND systems and is well positioned to outperform as the NAND market inflects higher. Against this backdrop of strong semiconductor demand and accelerated technology transitions, we are seeing increased momentum for our newly launched products. Acara, our latest generation conductor etch system, has doubled its installed base over the past year, with production tool of record wins for EUV and high aspect ratio etch applications in advanced DRAM and foundry logic. Critical dimensions in foundry logic are shrinking by roughly 10%-20% node to node. Similarly, in DRAM, aspect ratios are increasing with each node, and process complexity is set to grow even more with future moves to 4F squared and 3D DRAM.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nConsequently, multiple customers have chosen Acara for its unmatched ability to etch the smallest dimensions at very high aspect ratios while maintaining profile control and reducing variability across the wafer. This is achieved through new innovations, including our direct drive, solid-state power delivery hardware, and tempo plasma pulsing. In next-generation gate-all-around devices, we expect the number of applications using Acara to grow by roughly 2 times, including wins for critical front-end silicon etch applications. In DRAM, we already have wins with Acara for the 1C node that are set to ramp this year, and expect growing momentum as the applications using Acara expand nearly 3 times in the subsequent 1D node. As we look out over a multiyear period, the unprecedented AI ramp demands greater speed and agility across the ecosystem.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nOur customers are moving faster at every stage of process development and manufacturing, so we have increased the velocity of our execution across the board. We are strengthening our supply base, automating logistics, and ramping high-volume manufacturing. Over the last 4 years, we have nearly doubled our overall manufacturing capacity, and in 2025, we launched state-of-the-art automated warehouses that enable greater production efficiency. These investments have proved critical in a fast-ramping market environment, and we're set to expand our footprint further to meet the demand we see over the next several years. Our product sales and support teams are also executing to the accelerated pace of customer demand. Over the course of 2025, Lam was recognized with nearly 40 supplier awards, highlighting, in many cases, our fast tool installations and outstanding production ramp support.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nLooking forward, we see Lam's equipment intelligence solutions and Dextro cobots leading the way to the autonomous fab, with predictive and automated maintenance and precise global fleet matching. Dextro continued to gain momentum in 2025, expanding to cover six different Lam tool types. And finally, in an environment where inflections are more complex and innovation timelines are compressing, we have transformed our R&D capabilities to help us stay ahead. We are utilizing velocity labs located close to our customers to screen new materials, new hardware, and new process regimes at a rate not previously possible. We are also leveraging Lam's digital twinning capabilities to shorten product development cycles and converge on next-generation tool and process solutions with greater efficiency. Wrapping up, the growth we envisioned for Lam at our investor event one year ago is materializing faster than we anticipated.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nWe are making progress against our SAM expansion, share gain, and profitability objectives. With the demand environment continuing to accelerate, we are elevating our focus on scaling the company, delivering for customers, and outperforming in the AI era. Thank you, and here's Doug.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nGreat. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a super busy earnings season. Before I get into the details, I'd like to say that we were quite pleased with the strong execution across the company in calendar year 2025, which translated into record top and bottom-line financial performance. In calendar year 2025, revenue was a record, coming in at $20.6 billion, which was up 27% year over year. TSBG revenue also reached a record of $7.2 billion. Gross margin was 49.9%, the highest result as a combined company for the full year since the Novellus merger back in 2012. Gross profit increased 31% year over year to $10.3 billion.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nWe also had record operating margin of 34.1% and operating profit dollars of $7 billion, which was up 41% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share were $4.89, which was up 49% year-over-year. Looking at it, we delivered leverage from the top to the bottom of the PML in 2025. Let me turn to the December quarter results. Our revenue was above the midpoint of guidance, while gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share all exceeded the high end of our guided range. Revenue for the December quarter was a record, coming in at $5.34 billion. This marked our 10th consecutive quarter of revenue growth.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThe deferred revenue balance at quarter end came in at $2.25 billion, down sequentially due to an approximately $500 million reduction in those customer advance down payments. From a market segment perspective, foundry accounted for 59% of our systems revenue in the December quarter, slightly down sequentially, but up from 35% in the December 2024 period. This underscores the success of our strategic focus and execution in foundry. Foundry strength came from investments at the leading edge in addition to mature node spending that we saw in China. Memory was 34% of systems revenue, in line with prior quarter. Within memory, we generated record DRAM revenue, accounting for 23% of systems revenue, which was up from 16% in the September quarter.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nInvestments in high bandwidth memory continued to remain strong, driven by movement to HBM3E and HBM4. We also saw traditional node migrations to the 1B and 1C nodes, enabling the transition to DDR5. Non-volatile memory contributed 11% of our systems revenue, down from 18% in September quarter. This trajectory was in line with our expectations for customer plans coming into the year. Despite the quarterly decline, NAND revenues grew strongly for Lam in what was a first half weighted calendar year, 2025. As we enter 2026, we see solid end market demand as customers prepare for the next stage of AI-driven growth in NAND. And finally, the logic and other segment came in at 7% of systems revenue in the December quarter, slightly up sequentially. Let's turn to the regional breakdown of our total revenue.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nChina came in at 35%, which was a decrease from the prior quarter level of 43%, but slightly higher than our original expectations. This was due to updates in the affiliate rule and the resulting timing of shipments from that. The next largest geographic concentrations were Taiwan, coming in at 20%, up sequentially from 19%, and Korea at 20%, up sequentially from 15%. Customer Support Business Group generated approximately $2 billion in revenue for the December quarter, up 12% sequentially on an increase in reliant systems. We were 14% higher than the same period in 2024, primarily on growth in spares. CSPG obviously remains a key part of our growth strategy with our expanding installed base and innovation in advanced services. NAND spending enabled record upgrade revenue in 2025, up more than 90% year-over-year.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nIn the 13 years since we brought Lam and Novellus together, I'd like to remind everybody that CSPG has grown every year except for once. Let's look at profitability. Gross margin in the December quarter was 49.7%, which exceeded the high end of our guided range on better-than-expected customer mix. Sequentially, gross margin was about a percentage point lower, reflecting a customer mix that was less favorable than what we saw in September. Operating expenses for December came in at $827 million, which was roughly flat sequentially. R&D accounted for 68% of the total operating expenses. We continue investing to maintain our leadership with a differentiated product portfolio for our customers, with innovations like Vantex, Acara, Halo, and Dextro. The December quarter operating margin was 34.3%, exceeding the high end of our guidance.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in at 13.2%, generally in line with our expectations. We continue to see the tax rate in the low to mid-teens for calendar 2026. Other income and expense for the December quarter was approximately $10 million in income, compared with $8 million in income in the September quarter. Slight fluctuation in OINE was primarily the result of gains in our venture portfolio, partly offset by lower interest income. As we've talked about in the past, you should expect to see variability in OINE quarter to quarter. The capital return in the December quarter, we allocated approximately $1.4 billion towards share buybacks through open market share repurchases. Our average buyback price in the quarter was approximately $154 per share.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nIn calendar year 2025, we repurchased approximately 39 million shares at an average price of $104 per share. We also paid $328 million in dividends in the quarter. In calendar year 2025, we returned 85% of our free cash flow. Our plans remain to return at least 85% of free cash flow to our shareholders over time. The December quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.27, which came in above the guidance range. The diluted share count was 1.26 billion shares, which was a reduction from the September quarter and consistent with our guidance. We have $5.1 billion remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase plan. Let me pivot to the balance sheet.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $6.2 billion at the end of the December quarter, a decrease from $6.7 billion at the end of the September quarter. The reduction of cash is attributed to capital return as well as CapEx spending. As we look ahead, our strong cash position and continued free cash flow enable us flexibility to potentially simply repay the $750 million March 2026 notes when they mature. Day sales outstanding was 59 days in the December quarter, a decrease from 62 days in the September quarter. Inventory turns improved to 2.7 times from 2.6 times in the prior quarter and up from 1.5 times a little over two years ago. As a company, we remain focused on asset utilization, and we were pleased by the sustained progress we continue to make.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nOur non-cash expenses in the December quarter included approximately $89, $89 million for equity compensation, $91 million for depreciation, and $13 million in amortization. Capital expenditures for the December quarter was $261 million, which was up $76 million from the September quarter. Spending was driven by investments in manufacturing capacity, R&D, and lab infrastructure that supports our technology roadmap and customer needs. We also purchased a new building in Arizona to support the growing industry footprint there. This capital spending remains consistent with our global strategy of expanding capabilities close to where our customers are. Looking forward, we continue to expect capital expenditure to be in the 4%-5% of revenue range. We ended the December quarter with approximately 19,700 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 300 people from the prior quarter.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nHeadcount increases were primarily within the field organization to support customer growth, as well as in R&D to support our long-term product roadmap. Let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2026 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $5.7 billion, ±$300 million. We're expecting gross margin of 49%, ±1 percentage point. We're expecting to see slight headwinds from customer mix. We're forecasting operating margins of 34%, ±1 percentage point. You'll see the normal seasonal uptick in operating expenses in the March quarter. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.35, ±10 cents, based on a share count of approximately 1.26 billion shares. So let me wrap up.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nWe delivered a record year in 2025, reflecting strong execution and broad-based strength across our product portfolio. As we look into 2026, we expect meaningful year-over-year growth, supported by sustained demand in AI-driven markets and continued investment in capacity. We agree with the prevailing view that much of the market will be undersupplied in 2026 due to clean room space constraints. In line with that, we see 2026 as a second half-weighted year. With our strong balance sheet and expanding installed base and the strength of our product portfolio, we remain confident in Lam's ability to continue to outperform and deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touchtone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 14**\nThanks a lot. Doug, I had a question about WFE this year. So you said we're going to be constrained because of this fab readiness. Is it possible to say how much? I know you're guiding, you know, WFE to $135 billion this year. I mean, if we use semiconductor revenue, and you assume sort of a normal WFE and intensity number, seems like you could get to, like, $150 billion. So maybe the constraints are costing the industry, like, $15 billion. Is it possible to give a number in terms of how much the constraints are kind of costing in terms of, you know, WFE this year, so we can kind of pro forma that out?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, Tim, I knew somebody was going to ask that question. I should have anticipated it was going to be you. Listen, it's hard for us to put a number on it, and I'm going to decline to do that as we sit here right now. And the reason, Tim, is plans are somewhat fluid, if we're honest, meaning people are trying to figure out how to get a little more clean room space, how to bring facilities online and bump things up a little bit. So I'm not. We're not going to put a number on it. But I think it's safe to say, and Tim can comment on this, as well. Yeah, I think it sets up for 2027 to also be a pretty good year as we think through this.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nI mean, the industry seems to be sold out for most of what it's supplying, and everybody's talking about these multi-year agreements that they're working on. And I think that's largely a reflection of the fact that demand is very strong, and there's just not enough clean room out there.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, I don't have much to add, Tim, other than to say that clearly you've seen a large number of fab announcements. I mean, those are—those fab announcements are capacity in 2027, 2028, and beyond. And so, you know, I think there's a view that, you know, the constraints this year are gonna continue, even out until many of those new fabs open up. And so, I think we've given you a view of what we think WFE is. As Doug said, you know, we're working on productivity improvements to get a little extra output for customers. That's how we support them. But, fundamentally, it's a pretty big challenge.\n\n**Speaker 14**\nThanks a lot. Doug, and then you're guiding gross margin down a bit on upside revenue. Sounds like it's-\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah.\n\n**Speaker 14**\npredominantly related to China. So China was 35% in December. Is it gonna come down? Like, is that the reason why the gross margin is coming down? And if so, like, what mix do you think China will be for March?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, I'm not gonna give you a hard number, Tim, but yes, it's customer mix. It's gonna be less rich in the March quarter, and I'll also remind everybody that this isn't a fixed cost business for us. So as volume goes up and down, the component that just benefits from revenue growing isn't that big. The mix component of both product as well as customer is the important item. So you're latched onto the right thing, Tim.\n\n**Speaker 14**\nOkay, thank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYep, thank you.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 2**\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess to follow up on that last question, Doug, could you speak a bit about, you know, the work you're doing with the supply chain, bringing on manufacturing, ramping Malaysia, and how we should think about that, in the context of gross margins as revenues ramp in the second half of calendar 2026 and beyond?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, C.J., I mean, we've been talking for a while, I think, about CapEx growing as a result of expanding manufacturing capability. Tim specifically talked about it doubling over the last four or five years. So it's been an item that we've been clearly very focused on. We're ramping globally, and you're right, that Malaysia location is our biggest location as we sit here today, and we're trying to get more out of that, in addition to everywhere that we are. But the mix component, C.J., is gonna be more important than anything, at least in the near term, less than just volume ramping.\n\n**Speaker 2**\nGreat, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up question on CSPG. I would think your customers are trying to get every bit that they can out. And so, the uplift that you saw in the December quarter, and I assume continued strength into March, you know, is that something that will sustain throughout the whole calendar year and should drive, you know, better than kind of that 12% growth CAGR, or does that take a pause at some point as the transition focuses on greenfield investments?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, C.J., I'll let Doug speak to the specific numbers, but I think that what you should keep in mind is the CSPG. A lot of our growth, of course, is driven by customers' near-term actions and what we need to do to help them get maximum amount of output from the tools they have. But a lot of the growth really is we're transforming our service business to be much more oriented towards the use of equipment intelligence for predictive maintenance as a way of getting more output from tools, and also implementation of Dextro cobots for our automated maintenance. And both of those things not only will drive top line growth, but also margin profitability improvement, just given the efficiency with which we deliver those services.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nAnd so I think there's a number of moving pieces that are all positive for CSPG.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, and I would just add, CJ, you know, we were pleased to see the chamber count number up. Obviously, we knew that was coming, and we're happy to share it with you. So that, that's an aspect of what we're continuing to take advantage of going forward. It's very consistent, though, with what we articulated at that Investor Day back, I guess, almost a year ago. And so I would still want you thinking about CSPG growing the same way we described it back then, which is kind of high single digit, maybe low double digit. We had a very strong December quarter. It was primarily the result of Reliant systems. But that piece might be a little bit lumpy. It always is. But again, CSPG is just gonna keep chugging along.\n\n**Speaker 2**\nThank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, CJ.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 0**\nHi, thank you for taking my question. The first one for Tim. Tim, on the DRAM market, when do you see the volume adoption of 4F Squared from 6F Squared? And can you talk about your SAM market share, when you move to 4F Squared? I know you called out Acara in your prepared remarks.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah. So I think 4F squared, I mean, obviously there's still some question as to exact timing, and, you know, customers have talked about it being something towards the end of the decade, probably full volume production. But clearly, we're engaged today with customers looking at the technical needs. And, you know, we called out Acara. Acara is very well suited to the types of high aspect ratio, very small features that exist in 4F squared, as well as, you know, other devices we've talked about, whether it's future gate-all-around or even as foundry logic moves to CFET. And so, you know, Acara is—it's a sort of a foundational tool for us in terms of capabilities that are going to be important for all of these transitions.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nBut you really should think about, you know, those kinds of technology transitions occurring after, probably after this next big wave of fab openings. But again, back to the constraint question, you know, in some ways, if this turns out to be, as we believe, a multi-year build-out of fabs, the fabs that come towards the end of that will be the fabs that benefit from the SAM expansion and share gain that we're going to see coming from these new products that we've talked about. So, anyway, I think 4F squared is probably on the back end of that, but there's a lot in between that will also drive our business.\n\n**Speaker 0**\nGreat. And then, Doug, on the NAND market, I know the NAND memory dynamics were in line with your expectations in the December quarter, but NAND was down sequentially and DRAM up. Do you see the NAND makers slowing down technology migrations as they focus more on in terms of, like, minting money, given how the supply shortages are materializing? And when do you see NAND new capacity additions coming on?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, Tip. No, I, listen, NAND played out exactly as we saw it as the year began in 2025, and as we sit here looking in 2026, it'll be a growth year for NAND. There's no question about that in our minds. I think what I observed the memory customers doing, at least to the extent that they have both NAND and DRAM right now anyway, is prioritizing DRAM over NAND a little bit because profitability there is somewhat better. I, I think you all understand that and know that. But that doesn't mean that people aren't focused on NAND. In fact, one of our largest customers announced a new fab that's going to be dedicated, pretty... Well, not dedicated, but heavily emphasizing NAND capacity. And so that's on the come line.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nWe see that happening as we get into 2026 growth; that is happening. We're still sticking by; we think upgrades happen before real capacity additions, but you're gonna, you're gonna see a combination of both. And that $40 billion that we've been talking about likely happens quicker than what we originally expected a year ago. So anyway, we, we, we feel quite good about where NAND is trending.\n\n**Speaker 0**\nThank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Otto.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 15**\nThanks for taking my questions. So you're guiding WFE up 23%. I think last year you said you gained a point of share. Do you expect to maintain or gain share this year, Tim? What, what are kind of the puts and takes around the different markets? And then specifically, what are you assuming for China contribution overall for WFE and what that means for LAM in calendar 2026?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, let me, let me take the first part of it. I mean, I think what's important to remember from the, the longer-term plan we laid out at last year's Investor Day and things I said on the call today, we expect to gain share and expand our SAM at every successive technology node. And so to your point, do we plan to, to sustain or, or increase share? The answer is we, we plan to increase our share of WFE again this year. And what needs to take place is, technology transitions need to keep occurring, and what we're seeing in the environment today is, those are accelerating. That's a way for customers to get more output, and, and more output of the types of devices that are strongly demanded by the AI environment.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nAt the same time, those technology transitions are driving higher deposition and etch intensity, which is pretty much our entire business. And so, from that perspective, that's a real positive for us. And then we've talked about the success of our new products. I mean, we have refreshed our conductor etch product line. We've previously refreshed our dielectric etch line. We've launched Moly. Dry resist is gaining traction. We're strong in advanced packaging. Backside power is still to come, and it's going to be a driver for us. And so I think we have confidence that whatever the WFE is, if it's technology-driven, as it looks like it will be, we will continue to expand SAM, gain share of WFE.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nNow, as far as China goes, I think that we are looking at China being a more kind of flattish year-on-year, and therefore, as the rest of the technology-driven part of the business grows, becoming a smaller percentage of our overall revenue.\n\n**Speaker 15**\nGot it. And for my follow-up, I think in the past, you have given this $40 billion or so addressable opportunity to upgrade the installed base to higher layer counts. I'm curious, where are we now at, you know, versus that $40 billion number? How much more to go? And given this emerging role of NAND, or this enhanced role of NAND, I should say, in AI inference, is there a new number versus that $40 billion number that you had before? Thank you.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, I think we might wait until a little later in the year to refresh that number, but, you know, we've said a few times now, the specific wording we used at Investor Day was, $40 billion over several years. We've now, I think, on almost every earnings call, said that seems to be happening faster than expected. And today, I reiterated that, which was, you know, NAND is moving faster than we expected, on the upgrade path. And I think we'll come out and look. As Doug just mentioned, we're starting to see, you know, more interest in investing in NAND capacity, but it trades off. I mean, when you have clean room space, everybody has to make a decision as to where to use that today.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nBut I think that as we move forward and we see the growth from AI inference and other use cases, NAND is going to take its place in the AI data infrastructure and memory infrastructure, and I think you'll see growth there. We're just executing to the customer demand today faster than we had previously expected and anticipate more to come. Thank you, Tim.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Vivek.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 11**\nThank you. Tim, I want to go back to the previous question. The one point of WFE share that you gained, maybe if you could help us understand if it is coming primarily in foundry and logic, or if you're seeing that across the board, because foundry and logic is where you, I think, made the most progress in the last couple of years. And then, you know, Doug said you expect year-on-year growth to be meaningful this year. Just, you know, given your WFE expectation for 22% growth, should I, I guess, should we model 22% plus growth on the top line for the year?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, so let me take the first one. The share gains came from a combination of both NAND and foundry logic. And again, it's, you know, you might think already we have very high share in NAND, but as technology transition occurs and layer count increases, we have an opportunity still to gain share of some of the new applications required to enable those higher layer counts. And so, we gained share in NAND. But a lot of our focus, we talked about, over the last number of years, has been to launch products that allow us to gain share at the gate-all-around nodes, more advanced foundry logic and the transitions that are coming there, and also in advanced DRAM.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nWe saw this year some of those foundry logic share gains coming through in the numbers that you can see. So I'd say those, primarily NAND, and foundry logic this year. And then, sorry, the second question, can you just repeat the second question?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nWhat was the second question, Srini?\n\n**Speaker 11**\nYeah, so I guess my second question was about, you know, your expectation for the current year. I know you said-\n\n**Speaker 13**\nOh, got it.\n\n**Speaker 11**\nIt's going to be second half weighted.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nSorry.\n\n**Speaker 11**\nYeah.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, no, no. We, you know, your, your comment was basically will we outperform the WFE that we just talked about?\n\n**Speaker 11**\nYeah.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nI guess that's the message we're trying to deliver is we're gonna expand SAM, gain share, and we're gonna outperform WFE this year, is our current view.\n\n**Speaker 11**\nOkay, got it. Thanks for that. And then one quickly. On the op margin, Doug, I think at the Analyst Day, you know, you gave us the guidance for 34-35 at roughly-\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah\n\n**Speaker 11**\n... $25 billion-$27 billion, and you're already there. I think you're, you know, around $23 billion run rate, if I look at your March guidance. So I guess my question is, as we go through the next few quarters, you know, how should we think about the, you know, op margin fall through? I know you're guiding OpEx a little bit, a little bit of growth here, but just wanna understand how we should model OpEx going forward.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, Srini, thanks for the question. Yeah, no, we're pretty pleased with how we've performed. Clearly, we're ahead of the model, right? I mean, that model had, you know, is 28 kind of model. And we're run rating, at least on a percentage basis, what the model suggests we're gonna be able to do. You know, Ram and I and Tim were debating a little bit. We probably later in the year need to come out and give you an update on that model, and I think we'll do that. Lots have changed in the last year or so, so stay tuned for that. I think as we think about this year, frankly, this is a management team that prides itself on being able to deliver leverage through to the bottom line.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nWe really did a great job with it last year, which is why I went through all the kind of demonstration of what we did last year. We will be focused on delivering leverage as we go through this year as well. And, like I said, we'll give you an update to that longer term model probably later in the year.\n\n**Speaker 11**\nThanks, Doug.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Srini.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 5**\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, relative to your prior comments on NAND, understand there's a little more prioritization toward DRAM right now, but when do you expect that your customers are gonna sort of pivot from NAND upgrades to more greenfield NAND capacity additions? We saw some announcements from at least one of your customers recently on that. So I'm curious about, you know, when you expect to sort of see that upgrade business turn into greenfield business. Could that be by, you know, before the end of 2026, or is it more of a 2027 event, or maybe even later? Thank you.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, it's a great question. I think that the way we view it right now is that because of the clean room space constraints, it's probably, again, part of that multiyear build-out, 2027, 2028, when clean room space is sufficiently available such that they can invest in additional NAND capacity in a big way. So that's that's probably our view right now. In the meantime, we've talked about the acceleration of the technology transitions. You do get, you know, bit growth, you get more capacity of the higher performing bits that are in strong demand of AI. And so I think that those are the decisions that people are making today, is move ahead as quickly as possible with many of the key technology transitions.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nAnd so we're busy doing upgrades, and that's where our focus is right now. But greenfield will come eventually, and you've seen some of those initial announcements, and I think that's encouraging for all of us.\n\n**Speaker 5**\nThat's very clear. Thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-on, I think we all can see the trends by foundry, DRAM and NAND. They're in play right now, in terms of the level of growth rate. But as we head into 2027 or the end of 2026, do you see, you know, the potential rank order of those growth rates sort of changing amongst those categories?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nOh, man, Jim, that's a great question, going into 2027. We just for the first time gave you a 2026 number. You're asking 2027. Listen, in 2026, we're very confident everything is growing. It is unequivocal. And we're also very clear when we look, everything is constrained, frankly, right? You're hearing it from every one of our customers when they talk about things, and they're talking about these multiyear agreements to kind of deliver the visibility into next year. Foundry and Logic has grown a lot this year. DRAM's grown a lot this year. NAND is growing a little bit less, but still growing pretty well this year.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nAt the end of the day, though, when you look at these system architectures, all this stuff needs to fit together, and you saw one of the big accelerator guys talking about this at CES. Like, \"Hey, you know, we need this NAND stuff showing up.\" That's happening, clearly. So, into 2027, I think we're gonna see another year where everything is growing. I'm not ready to rank order it, quite yet, Jim, though.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nI think as we move through this year, though, we already, you know, I would say, have better visibility into the following year than I think I can ever remember. And that's simply because, you know, customers know that they're building these fabs. They're announcing them. They're signaling to their customers they're gonna have that capacity available. And so clearly, we're having discussions at this point on what tools are gonna be needed, what technology nodes are gonna be running in those fabs, and they want to make sure that they can secure the capacity such that that fab can be started up and producing as quickly as possible. And so those discussions on those fabs are clearly out into 2027.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nBut I think in terms of exactly how those decisions get made through this year, and, you know, once you have clean room space, it you know, in some cases can, as we just talked about, they can trade off sometimes a little bit of clean room space to be used for DRAM or for NAND, or for what we've seen in a few cases, is for Advanced Packaging. You know, I talked about the tremendous growth in Advanced Packaging and the importance that it's the role that it's playing. And so, you know, we've been seeing that. So I guess we'd have to see the year continue to evolve and how the markets kind of where the demand is the shortest.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nBut we would anticipate, as we said, robust investment across all device segments, and I think that continues on into 2027 across all three segments.\n\n**Speaker 12**\nThank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Jim.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 7**\nHi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the good results and guide. Doug, my first question is, I understand that you spoke about the global manufacturing footprint, it's doubled over the last four years. Just wondering, as your customers ramp up more onshore manufacturing, would it lead to you increasing shipments from your U.S. facilities in California and Oregon rather than Malaysia for some of your products? If so, what would be the margin implications?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, Krish, listen, we have a global manufacturing footprint, right? We've got factories in Oregon, California, Ohio, Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, Austria. I think I didn't miss anything there. We have some level of flexibility, given enough time to move things around if we really need to do that. And as customers tell us what they need and where they need it, we may adjust things. Right now, I think we feel pretty good about how we've got things set up, though.\n\n**Speaker 7**\nGot it. Got it. Thanks for that. Then, Tim, I just have a follow-up for you, like a technical question. Last year, you had really good traction in ALD Moly. Are customers moving away from single wafer ALD to batch ALD for Moly? And if so, how would that impact Lam?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nNo, I mean, well, at this point, if we look. We had said previously that in kind of the order of adoption, NAND would be first to adopt moly, and we're seeing that, followed by Foundry Logic and then ultimately by DRAM. You know, what we can say right now is that the customers that have committed to production using moly in NAND have gone with Lam's tools. We have a very strong position there. And I think that the value of that, as we've talked in the past, is it means that throughout these first production ramps with ALD moly, we are building the installed base, we're maturing the tool, we're getting process learning. You know, competitors aren't going to give up.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nThis is an incredibly important market and a big inflection that we've talked about. But we feel really good about our single, you know, we call it single wafer moly, but if you look at the tool itself, it has multiple stations inside of one chamber in order to give ourselves high productivity. So, you know, that's a production tool, of course, today for the industry, and we intend to continue to keep it that way.\n\n**Speaker 7**\nGot it. Thanks a lot, Tim.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Krish.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 4**\nYeah, good afternoon, and great job on the quarterly execution. You know, just as many of your customers have been surprised by the sudden rise in compute and storage demand, and therefore requirements for more GPUs, XPUs, CPUs, and the associated memory and storage, they obviously got caught somewhat flat-footed in terms of sort of near to midterm capacity to support that demand curve, right, as you guys outlined. Is the stronger velocity of demand having a similar impact to your manufacturing capability and ability to procure the necessary components and subsystems, and any bottlenecks that you have in your supply chain?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nWell, it isn't without a lot of hard work, but you know, one good news is, you know, we did a lot of fact-finding post the COVID pandemic and the supply shortages that occurred, you know, in our own systems at that time, and we made a lot of improvements. And Doug just talked about the global nature of our manufacturing facilities-\n\n**Speaker 4**\nMm-hmm.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nSpanning from the U.S. and Europe and, and all through Asia. And we looked at the same thing with respect to our supply chain. And I would say today, compared to when we had those shortages, we have, we have built a much stronger, broader, deeper supply chain. And so, you know, I don't want to sell short the hard work of our supply chain guys today to meet all these expedited pull-in requests from customers. It's very hard work, but today, I would say we're not as—we're not the big constraint for any of the devices compared to clean room space being a constraint to the industry. And so, as the industry continues to go, we need to keep working to, again, expand our capacity, as I said, make our own operations faster.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nThat's why we've done things like automating our warehouses to make the rate at which we can feed those parts from the time they're received from the supplier into the manufacturing that much quicker and more efficient. And so we're just continually working on what I would refer to as our operational velocity, and so that we're not the constraint.\n\n**Speaker 4**\nI appreciate that. Then for my second question, you know, one of the significant, obviously, and incremental drivers of your business, among many, has been advanced packaging and HBM. You guys did about $1 billion plus in advanced packaging revenues. I think it was in calendar 2024. You're anticipating strong 40%+ growth this year. But can you guys quantify how much advanced packaging grew for the team in calendar 2025? And then of that 40% growth this year, is that being more driven by 2.5D, 3.5D advanced packaging or HBM?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, Harlan, we didn't quantify 2025 in packaging, except to tell you it, it grew nicely, and I think we're gonna kind of leave it at that. Tim gave you the 40% this year, so we're, we're, we're super excited about what's going on there. And I'll let Tim talk about the technologies.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, it's we've lumped it together. I mean, it is strength in HBM. Clearly, there's strong demand there. But also, I talked about more complex packaging schemes across advanced foundry logic, and that's an important driver for us as well. You know, the great thing about our advanced packaging capabilities is, you know, they're used in the advanced packaging of all device types. And so, you know, it's things like copper plating, it's things like etch, dielectric gap fills. And so they're really fundamental technologies to the success. So we, we-\n\n**Speaker 4**\nThank you.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nSee that as a really important business, and we've talked about the fact that, you know, we continue to invest in new technologies in that space.\n\n**Speaker 4**\nThank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Harlan.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 12**\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, you know, Doug, you've clearly said it's a second half loaded year, which is fine. What does that imply for the first half of the calendar year? Like, is March quarter the trough? Do you think things are kind of flattish at the March level until we get that second half inflection? Just how are you thinking about the shape of the year?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, you know, Stacy, it's a great question. I frankly, as I sit here right now, I think we're gonna see growth every quarter from the previous quarter. I'm not gonna give you a precise number. We feel good about that March quarter. I think June probably grows from that, September from that, and it ends up being a second half-weighted year, both from a WFE standpoint and from our revenue.\n\n**Speaker 12**\nI guess to get there, would you need an inflection in that growth rate in the second half? I guess some of it's compares, which makes it easier, but just are you thinking there's an inflection? Do you think the growth is steady, or?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nI think it's reasonably steady. I mean, the part of it's gonna get modulated by, okay, how much clean room space is available at each customer, and I think that, you know, they're trying to figure out still, and so are we, which is why I'm not giving you more specificity. It will be second half-weighted, but like I said, I think you'll see growth quarter by quarter as we go through 2026.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nStacy, I guess the only thing I would add is that, I was just gonna add that, you know, my comment about basically every customer is asking for pull-ins, and so there is some element of, you know, whether, whether or not we can accelerate some small portion in, you know, into the first half of the year. We would still see growth in the second, because obviously, that probably means things start pulling in from the first half of next year as well. But we're in an accelerating environment of, of both demand and also, timing requests, you know. And so, you know, I think that back to the question that was asked about constraints, I think we need to see through the year how those play out as to, you know, kind of how, how we, how much we can do.\n\n**Speaker 12**\nGot it. Thank you. That's helpful. And for my second question, I just wanted to ask about China. So Doug, I think you said you expected China to be flattish year over year. Was that a market statement, or was that a Lam revenue statement? And the percentage should go down. I guess it was, I don't know what it was, 36% or something in calendar 2025. You had talked previously about, like, a 30% threshold. Do you think it gets to that 30%, or you think it's just down but doesn't quite get there?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, Stacy, the comment, in fact, Tim made, it was we think WFE in China is flattish, 25%-26%, and everything else is gonna grow. So as a percent of the total, it's gonna be down. We didn't give a precise number. Whether it's in the low 30s or high 20s, that's ± probably where, where it is. And part of it'll, will be modulated by how much growth comes from outside of China. It's a numerator, denominator thing as well, obviously.\n\n**Speaker 12**\nYeah, I got it. I got it. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Stacy.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Blaine Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 4**\nHey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Couple questions. Maybe just Doug, I wanted to just understand the strength in Reliant, you know, with China down, is that multinational? I just was curious where you're seeing that demand. I know you said it was lumpy. I just was curious why it was up so much.\n\n**Speaker 3**\n... It was multinational and it was China. It, it was a little bit of both of them, Blaine.\n\n**Speaker 1**\nGot you. Thanks. And then just on the NAND front, you know, obviously, the demand is very strong. You talked about the upgrades happening earlier. Does that fit in the camp of also second half weighted? I mean, it's not waiting on clean room space. I'm just kind of curious the shape of NANDs with you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, it probably is a little bit second half weighted, Blaine.\n\n**Speaker 1**\nOkay, thank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Blaine.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Melissa Weathers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 8**\nHi, thank you. I wanted to go back to the NAND side and touch on something that Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks on the expanding applications for NAND in the data center. And Doug, you kind of alluded to some of the CES announcements as well. So is the right interpretation that those applications in the data center have expanded versus what you guys had been thinking? Because you guys have been talking about NAND, NAND in the data center for several quarters now. So is that the right way to think about it? And then, what could this mean for, like, your Moly ALD, your 300-layer type devices and the expanding share you could get there?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, sure. I, I think, we, we characterize it as, as a new use case. So I, I don't think we saw this particular use case coming, which is, you know, related to the AI inference and, kind of the expansion of TB cache and, and such. I think our previous estimates have been more, kind of, on more traditional storage for using enterprise SSDs. And so, yeah, this is, this is an expansion and, and kind of presents a, a bit longer term, growth opportunity for, for NAND. And so therefore, it would be beyond the kind of projections that we would have given back at Investor Day a year ago for the, the outlook for NAND long term.\n\n**Speaker 8**\nGreat, thank you. Then a quick question on the inventory side of things. Doug, I just wanted to check in and see how you're thinking about parts availability and your ability to scale production in line with demand. Can you help us with a framework to think about how you're thinking about inventories on a days or dollars basis?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nYeah, Melissa, no, it's a great question. Listen, if we're right about how things play out here, it's very likely that we're going to need to build some inventory in total dollar terms as we go through the year, right? When business grows, you got to have stuff ready for that growing business, so I think that's clearly going to happen. We will remain focused on asset utilization and efficiencies and hopefully be able to drive turns up a little bit from here. But we definitely are going to need to build some inventory in advance of a growing top line. So we'll, we'll be working on all of that, Melissa.\n\n**Speaker 8**\nThank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Melissa.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThe next question comes from Joe Quattrocchi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 6**\nHey, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to follow up on that, is there any area of your supply chain where you're, you know, you're pushing suppliers, maybe that could be a potential area of shortage, or do you feel like there's available capacity to continue to kind of support the growth you're talking about?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nWell, I think that we don't have any line of sight to significant problems at this point. I made the comment a couple of times. It's clearly a lot of work, given the accelerated nature of the demand and the high levels of demand, and customer requests for pullings, you know, well within our normal lead times. But at this point, you know, we're working across our global supply chain to ensure that we can meet the demand.\n\n**Speaker 6**\nThanks. And maybe as a follow-up, China now expected to be flattish. Is that, is that a reflection of just the, the affiliate rule impacts reentering kind of WFE across, across, you know, the, the company base or, or in terms of just your peers? Or is there, like, a change in the underlying demand that you're seeing as well in China?\n\n**Speaker 3**\nWell, I think it's, Joe, it's probably a little bit of affiliate rule, but frankly, it's, there's a broad-based set of customer spending in China that have nothing to do with the affiliate rule. So it's very broad.\n\n**Speaker 6**\nThank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThanks, Joe. Operator, we will do one more question.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nOkay, our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\n**Speaker 1**\nOh, thanks. Thanks for putting me in. Hi, Tim and Doug. Just a quick question on the foundry side. I think, China was down, I guess you mentioned the affiliate rule, but your foundry is growing almost 100% plus year-on-year. Just wondering, as you look at 2026, 2027, with some of the leading-edge foundries accelerating, how you see that roadmap?\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, well, I guess, speaking to what it looks like from a roadmap perspective is, you know, each technology node, we said the opportunity for Lam from an etch-and-depth intensity perspective and how our tools, you know, like the Acara, and others fit into that. Our opportunities get bigger. As you move forward, you start seeing things that, again, we would anticipate, you know, future nodes like 27, 28, introduction of things like backside power. Again, more use of advanced packaging across more of the leading-edge foundry space. All of those things are good for us from both a SAM and a share perspective. So, and that's, it's a - from a product perspective, it's a very good picture for us.\n\n**Speaker 1**\nGot it. And then on the DRAM side, I know you mentioned briefly HBM4 with 16 layers. Obviously, that's a nice step up from where HBM is now. Can you talk to what that does for your, you know, WFE, the content and the growth there on the DRAM HBM side? Thanks.\n\n**Speaker 13**\nYeah, I mean, just in general terms, I mean, what happens is you end up going to next generation HBM, dies become bigger, and that's generally what is creating the majority of the problem relative to when we talk about clean room space constraints. You need more clean room space and more tooling per fit that comes out of the fab. So therefore, that is what we're trying to communicate is, obviously, the performance improves, but the space required and the equipment required increases.\n\n**Speaker 1**\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Speaker 3**\nThank you, Vijay. Yeah, appreciate everybody's questions today. That concludes our call for today. We'll look forward to seeing everybody as we do the conference circuit and get out on the road. So thank you for your time today.\n\n**Speaker 9**\nThank you, everyone. The conference is now concluded. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Ram, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Lam delivered a solid September quarter, highlighted by record revenues of $5.3 billion, gross margin of 50.6%, and record operating margin of 35%. We also achieved record combined spares and services revenue, and growth in total CSPG revenue outpaced the increase in installed base units. Inclusive of our guidance for the December quarter, we expect to close calendar 2025 with three consecutive quarters of greater than $5 billion in revenue. Our performance reflects strong company-wide execution and the critical role that our products and services portfolio plays in enabling the industry's technology roadmap and in addressing the rapid increase in semiconductor manufacturing complexity. Our December quarter guidance does contemplate roughly a $200 million revenue impact from the recently announced 50% affiliate rule, restricting shipments to certain domestic China customers.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nCurrently, we expect this rule to impact our calendar year 2026 revenues by approximately $600 million. This impact, together with the strong growth anticipated in worldwide wafer fabrication equipment or WFE spending, leads us to expect the China region to represent less than 30% of our overall revenues in calendar year 2026. Turning to WFE, spending in calendar year 2025 is shaping up to be slightly better than our prior view of $105 billion, predominantly due to better than expected high-bandwidth memory or HBM-related investments. As we look ahead, we see a robust setup for equipment spending in calendar year 2026. AI-related demand should support sustained strength in leading-edge foundry logic and DRAM, as well as continued manned upgrade spending. The strong leading-edge growth we see across all three device segments is forecasted to be partially offset by a decline in domestic China-related investments.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe plan to provide our detailed 2026 WFE spending outlook and subsegment color on our January call, per our usual practice. AI and its impact on the semiconductor industry continues to be a major topic of interest, and the data center CapEx investments already announced are expected to drive significant expansion of manufacturing capacity over a multi-year period. In recent months, we have seen an acceleration of activity. AI data centers require the most advanced CPU and accelerator capabilities, low latency, high-bandwidth memory, and high-speed eSSD storage, all integrated through 2.5D and 3D advanced packaging. We estimate these needs translate to roughly $8 billion of WFE spending for every $100 billion in incremental data center investment. Most importantly, deposition and etch, the area of Lam's core product differentiation, play an increasingly critical role in enabling the higher performance, more scalable semiconductor devices required for AI.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe see the surge in AI data center demand creating billions of dollars of served available market expansion and share gain opportunity for Lam in the coming years. I will share a few areas of strength we are seeing. In NAND, customers are continuing to upgrade existing fabs to meet the need for higher layer count, higher performance devices. We have estimated that these conversions will require $40 billion of WFE spending over the next several years. As we have previously said, Lam should capture a high percentage of this conversion spend due to our large installed base position. Our upgrades business is projected to remain strong into 2026, as NAND bit demand looks to be trending higher than prior expectations. Device makers have already announced enterprise-grade SSDs with 256 terabytes of storage capacity to satisfy growing data center demand for high-capacity storage.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAvailability of clean room space will likely act as a limiter to the pace of NAND supply growth, but we believe that capacity additions to meet rising bit demand may be needed sooner than previously thought. Lam is in a great position for both upgrade activity in the near term and new capacity builds in the future. We have the industry's largest installed base of NAND systems, and our comprehensive NAND product portfolio features several industry-first advances. Notably, Lam recently earned the 2025 SEMI Award for our pioneering Lam Cryo 3.0 dielectric etch technology, a process that has quickly become the industry standard for advanced NAND devices. We are also seeing solid demand for our atomic layer deposition or ALD products, including a recent key win at a major NAND manufacturer for a critical high aspect ratio dielectric deposition application.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nLam's differentiated conformal fill capability using a higher temperature process was fundamental in securing this win. On the metal side, Lam's Halo MOLE ALD tool has been selected as the tool of record for three consecutive nodes at a leading customer, including for devices with more than 500 layers. This further reinforces our leadership in the 3D NAND word line application, a step that is fundamental to building the higher performance devices required for eSSDs. The performance demands of AI devices are also spurring investment in foundry logic and DRAM manufacturing inflections. Over the last several years, we have focused on expanding our product portfolio to target these opportunities and believe we will benefit as the technology transitions unfold. For example, Lam's Ether dry-resist EUV patterning solution has demonstrated the ability to resolve features of less than 15 nanometers at the highest density and pattern fidelity.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nEther also enables a more than 10% reduction in EUV exposure dose, boosting scanner productivity and reducing the cost of patterning per wafer. Lam's Ether technology is already ramping in the HBM high-volume production line of a major memory manufacturer, and we see more opportunities ahead as we look further out on the roadmap. For instance, we believe high NA EUV in combination with Ether for single patterning of sub-10 nanometer features will be critical to addressing the complexity and cost challenges associated with the transition from gate all-around transistors to CFET in foundry logic, as well as the anticipated migration from 6F squared to 4F squared in DRAM. In September, we announced a key partnership with JSR Corporation, an innovative semiconductor materials company, to collaborate on the integration of our Ether technology with novel EUV patterning materials and metal oxide resists.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIn addition, Lam and JSR are partnering to explore new precursor materials for advanced ALD applications, which we believe can further enhance our capabilities and differentiation for future technology inflections. In the case of low-K ALD films, Lam's high-productivity single wafer solutions are enabling our customers to move past traditional furnace-based approaches. As logic transistor sizes scale down to achieve greater compute power, higher capacitive coupling in the gate module degrades overall performance. Similarly, as DRAM devices shrink, there is a detrimental increase in capacitance between the bit line and capacitor contact. To resolve these issues, deposited low-K films must be very thin, 5 nanometers or less, and conformal in high aspect ratio structures. Furnace-based films at these thicknesses are often fragile and unable to withstand the harsh chemistries used in subsequent process steps.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nLam's low-K ALD solution employs a unique single wafer remote plasma reactor and a novel precursor to deposit thin, defect-free films with the desired silicon carbon bonding structure. As a result, Lam's ALD films have demonstrated superior durability on the remainder of the chip-making process, and we recently secured critical wins at foundry, logic, and DRAM customers for low-K applications using this process. Beyond traditional device inflections, Lam is also benefiting from healthy growth in advanced packaging. Our Saber 3D plating and Cindian etch systems are industry leaders and should continue to see strong demand in 2026 as AI-related spending grows. Looking further ahead, we are investing in new advanced packaging opportunities. Today's packaging production lines primarily use 300 millimeter diameter wafers, but as AI and high-performance computing demand larger chips to integrate more accelerators, memory, and interconnects, panel-level packaging is emerging as a scalable solution.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nBy processing multiple units on larger format panels, it significantly improves manufacturing efficiency and supports the integration of increasingly complex and larger semiconductor devices. Lam's Saber 3D, Callisto, and Phoenix tools are being engineered to meet future panel packaging needs. We are collaborating across the ecosystem to drive industry-wide standardization and co-development, both of which are essential for scaling high-volume manufacturing and next-generation integration solutions. We expect to end this year with tools shipped to or installed at 20 customers worldwide. Our growing installed base of panel packaging tools is rapidly building experience and maturity that should prove valuable as this technology becomes mainstream in the future. To wrap up, Lam is poised to close out a record calendar year 2025, and our setup is strong heading into 2026, where we expect solid WFE growth.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThe technology requirements of AI play extremely well to Lam's product strengths, and we are excited by the breadth of opportunities we see ahead for the company. Now, here's Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. We executed well in the September 2025 quarter, delivering gross margin performance of 50.6%, which is a record in the post-Novellus period. Financial results for the quarter came in above the midpoint of all of our guidance ranges. We also delivered many financial records throughout the P&L. The company truly performed well in the quarter. Let's turn to the details of our September quarter results. Revenue for the September quarter came in at an all-time record of $5.3 billion, which was up 3% from the June quarter. The deferred revenue balance at quarter end was $2.77 billion, up slightly from the June quarter due to increases in services and system-related transactions where revenue recognition was not yet complete.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThis was partially offset by approximately $100 million of reduction in customer advanced down payments. We do expect to see these down payments continue to decline in the December quarter. From a market segment perspective, foundry accounted for 60% of our systems revenue in the September quarter, up from 52% in the June quarter. This marks our third consecutive record quarter, underscoring the strength of our strategic focus and execution in foundry. Foundry strength came from investments at the leading edge, in addition to mature node spending in China. Memory was 34% of systems revenue, which was down from 41% in the prior quarter due to the timing of customer investment plans. Within memory, non-volatile memory contributed 18% of our systems revenue, which was down from 27% in the June quarter. The trajectory of the NAND spending this year is broadly consistent with our expectations coming into the year.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nAs the industry transitions to devices of up to 100 layers, we continue to estimate over $40 billion in upgrade spending will be required over the next several years. DRAM increased from the June quarter, accounting for 16% of systems revenue compared to 14%. Investments in high-bandwidth memory continue to remain strong, driven by AI-related customer demand. We're also seeing traditional node migrations to the 1B and 1C nodes, enabling the transition to DDR5. The logic and other segment came in at 6% of systems revenue in the September quarter, roughly in line with the 7% we reported in the June quarter. Let's turn to the regional breakdown of our total revenue. China came in at 43%, an increase from the prior quarter level of 35%. While the multinationals in China remained steady, the domestic Chinese customers grew, and the majority of our China revenue continued to come from them.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThe next largest geographic concentrations were Taiwan at 19%, which was flat sequentially, and Korea at 15%, down sequentially from 22%, again due to the timing of customer investment plans. The Customer Support Business Group generated approximately $1.8 billion in revenue for the September quarter, slightly higher sequentially and year over year. This is being driven by continued strength in spares and upgrades. CSPG remains a key part of our growth strategy, given the expanding installed base and our innovation in advanced services. We expect CSPG to deliver year-over-year growth in 2025. In the 13 years since we brought Lam and Novellus together, CSPG has grown every year except for one. Let's look at profitability. Gross margin of the September quarter was 50.6% at the higher end of our guided range and improving from the June quarter level of 50.3%.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThe increase is primarily driven by favorable customer mix, partially offset by the impact of tariffs. I expect the impact from tariffs to continue to increase somewhat in the December quarter. Operating expenses for September were $832 million, which was up from the prior quarter level of $822 million. The increase is primarily due to increased headcount and incentive compensation, which is tied to the company's improved profitability. R&D accounted for 68% of the total operating expenses. We're investing in innovations like Vantex, Aqara, Halo, and Dextro to continue our leadership in providing a differentiated product portfolio for our customers. The September quarter operating margin was 35% at the high end of our guidance. This operating profit represents a record level for Lam in both dollars as well as percentage terms. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in at 14.2%, generally in line with our expectations.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe continue to see the tax rate in the low to mid-teens for the near term. We do expect, however, with the increase in the GILTI rate in the U.S., as well as the advent of the global minimum tax regime outside of the U.S., we will see a slight increase in our effective tax rate as we get into calendar year 2026. Other income expense for the September quarter was approximately $8 million in income, compared with $4 million in income in the June quarter. The slight increase in the line E was primarily the result of increased interest income tied to a higher cash balance. As we've talked about in the past, you should expect to see variability in the line E quarter to quarter. Let's look at capital return. In the September quarter, we allocated approximately $990 million to share buybacks through open market share repurchases.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOur average buyback price in the quarter was approximately $106 per share. Year to date, we've repurchased nearly 30 million shares at an average price of a little more than $88 per share. We also paid $292 million in dividends in the quarter. I'll remind you that we increased the dividend from $0.23 to $0.26 per share earlier this month. Moving forward, we remain committed to returning at least 85% of free cash flow to our shareholders over time. The September quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.26 above the midpoint of our range. The diluted share count was 1.27 billion shares, which was a reduction from the June quarter and consistent with our guidance. We have $6.5 billion remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase plan. Let me pivot to the balance sheet.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $6.7 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase from $6.4 billion at the end of the June quarter. The main reason for the cash increase was cash generated from operating activities, which was partially offset by cash allocated to capital return, as well as capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding was 62 days in the September quarter, which was up slightly from 59 days in the June quarter. September quarter inventory turns improved to 2.6 times compared with 2.4 times in the prior quarter and up from the levels two years ago of 1.5 times. We've remained focused on driving asset utilization during this timeframe, and I was pleased to see us deliver this outcome. Our non-cash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $97 million for equity compensation, $89 million for depreciation, and $13 million for amortization.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nCapital expenditures in the September quarter were $185 million, which was up $13 million from the June quarter. Spending was primarily focused on lab investments in the United States, along with expansion of manufacturing sites in Asia. This remains consistent with our global strategy to be close to our customers' development and manufacturing locations. We ended the September quarter with approximately 19,400 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 400 people from the prior quarter. Headcount increases were in R&D to support our long-term product roadmap. Additionally, we had increases within the field organization to support customer growth and a higher volume of tool installations. Let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2025 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $5.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million. We expect a decline in China revenue offset by stronger spending from the global multinationals.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe're expecting a gross margin of 48.5%, plus or minus 1%. I expect customer mix and tariffs will be contributing to the sequential decline in gross margin. We're expecting operating margins of 33%, plus or minus 1%. Finally, earnings per share of $1.15, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 1.26 billion shares. I want to give you a few things to think about as you build your 2026 models. While we are not yet quantifying the level of growth in WFE, I will tell you that calendar 2026 looks somewhat second-half weighted as we sit here today. The newly restricted China entities would have been weighted for the first half of next year. Customer mix will be a headwind to gross margin a bit next year as the China mix normalizes. The tax rate will likely tick up very slightly, as I previously mentioned.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe'll give you better color on all this during the December quarter call. Let me wrap up. Lam Research delivered another strong quarter highlighted by record levels of revenue, record gross, and operating profit. Inclusive of our December quarter guidance, we're on track to deliver calendar year 2025 at an all-time high watermark in financial performance, closing with three consecutive quarters of revenue above $5 billion. We remain focused on strategic investments that extend our technology leadership, operational efficiencies, and long-term value creation. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your headset before pressing the star keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. First question, very helpful guideposts for thinking through incremental WFE tied to AI infrastructure spending. Over the last six, eight weeks, we'd love to hear how your conversations with customers have progressed. Are you seeing expedited meetings? Are you seeing actual orders? We'd love to see how the announcements around infrastructure spending are translating into visibility on your business.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nSure, C.J., let me take that. Obviously, when we talk about announcements that are made recently, there's not physical space. There's not near-term demand for those. Those are things that give you guideposts as to where demand is going further in the future. I think to look at the conversations that we're having today about near-term needs for equipment, it's a lot of the things I talked about, which is enterprise SSDs and the impact on NAND. You've heard some of our customers, I believe, speak to bit demand that might be a little bit higher than expectations. I just said that our view of NAND upgrades is well on track for a good 2025 and a strong 2026. It's really down when we talk about our equipment demands. It's near-term needs with those longer-term announcements as opportunity in the future. They're along the same technology transitions.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThose data center investments are going to require faster GPUs made at smaller nodes for foundry logic. They're going to be made with higher capability HBM. That's where all of our products come into play. How we participate in gate all around our ALD tools, high aspect ratio conductor etch, on the DRAM side, the work we're doing in HBM to enable higher stacking of HBM devices. Again, we're seeing very, very robust demand, as we mentioned, going into 2026. It's for things that are real and here today.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. Maybe thinking through your relative outperformance to WFE, based on your guide, it looks like you're tracking on a tool shipment basis up 40%. I think many investors think we're growing 10% overall. Tremendous outperformance. I guess, how are you thinking about 2026? As part of that, what would be the critical drivers to drive relative outperformance? Thanks so much.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, sure. I'll let Doug add in here as well. I guess I would just say that you know, you have to remember that as fabs get built and equipment is brought in, there often are timing issues. It's a little bit hard to speak to any near-term like outperformance, underperformance with certainty because it depends on what other suppliers are going to be doing and when they're shipping and what their lead times are.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWhat we can say with quite a bit of confidence, and I think we laid it out at our investor day earlier this year, is that over the longer term, Lam's markets, etch and deposition, will outgrow WFE because of nearly every trend that's taking place technology-wise in semiconductor manufacturing, whether that's 3D devices in foundry logic, in NAND, whether it's smaller, higher aspect ratio devices and stacking using advanced packaging in DRAM, whether it's advanced packaging itself. They're all deposition and etch intensive products. Therefore, I think over the longer term, confidence to outperform WFE is very high.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nNothing to add, Tim. You nailed it. Thanks, C.J.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Doug, when we talked three months ago, you were thinking that December would be like $4.7 million. You were saying it'd be sort of back to where March was, and now it's coming in at $5.2 million. The incremental $400 to $500 million, where did that come from? It sounds like maybe a little bit of it pulled in from the first half of next year. Can you just sort of give us a sense what's actually better than what you thought three or so months ago?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, listen, I think Tim pointed in the fact that WFE is a little bit stronger. We think high-bandwidth memory in DRAM is a little bit stronger. Maybe everything else was just a little bit stronger, Tim. It's not any one thing that I would point to. I would tell you, though, honestly, it would have been even higher if not for the restricted entities in China. Things did strengthen for sure. As we look into next year, clearly next year is a growth year. Whether we pulled anything in from the first half, I honestly don't think so, Tim, because as we sit here today, I think the first half of next year is flat to maybe slightly up from the second half of this year. It's going to continue to be pretty good.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Great. Thanks, Doug. On the 2026 WFE in China, I know you and everyone else has the same message that it's going to be down. To be honest, that's what everybody said at this time last year too, and you're growing like 20% this year. I know that there's some others that are more close to flat. I mean, you're up a ton and virtually everyone else is up a ton too. It seems like we keep thinking that China will digest and that it'll be down, but they keep finding ways around these bans. Why would China be down next year? I guess I'm just trying to figure out, is there something different next year that you're seeing that maybe gives you the confidence that finally China is going to be down because it hasn't happened yet? Thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI guess what I'd say, Tim, it's twofold. First, the global multinationals outside of China are going to be pretty strong next year. That's part of it, right? Everything else is going to be stronger in 2026, I think, than it was in 2025. Honestly, as we sit here right now and look at the stack up of everybody's plans in China, it's going to be less. That's the best I can tell you. Yep, you're absolutely right. A year ago, when we were sitting here, we would have seen the same thing and then it strengthened through the year. I just right now don't see where that's going to come from next year, Tim.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay, Doug. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Tim.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks for taking my questions. For the first one, Tim, you gave this interesting statistic, $8 billion of WFE for, I think, every $100 billion in data center. How much of that $100 billion of data center spend is in semiconductors? Basically, what is the WFE intensity in an AI data center versus kind of the mid-teens, you know, WFE intensity for all semiconductors? Off that $8 billion, what is Lam's opportunity?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOkay, maybe I'll let Doug go ahead. Doug helped me either, but I guess just to clarify, the $8 billion was WFE for $100 billion of data center investment. That would represent the equipment portion that we could target. Given that data centers, and especially those focused on AI applications, require a leading edge across all three device segments, that's an area where Lam's SAM, as % of WFE, continues to increase at every technology node. All the things I'm talking about, whether it's, you know, high aspect ratio etches, it's Aether dry-resist solution, dry EUV resist, it's ALD, all of those are growing our opportunity in that $8 billion. That's where a lot of our focus is these days, the products that are required to do well through that spend.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nVivek, was that your question? Did that answer the question? I'm not sure we got it.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nMy question is different. You know, because if you look at WFE overall as a % of semiconductors, it's about mid-teens %. When we talk about $100 billion in data center spend, there's a lot of non-semiconductor spend as part of that. My question is, off that $100 billion, how much is semiconductor spend? What does that imply for WFE intensity in an AI environment? Off that $8 billion, how much is Lam's opportunity?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, listen, Vivek, if I'm honest, I don't know the precise answer to your first question. How much is semiconductor content as part of that $100 billion? It's a decent amount. I did GPUs, it's HBM, it's enterprise SSDs. I don't know the precise number, but I know it's a decent amount. Relative to our intensity and all of these things, it's very similar to what you've seen from us across the rest of semis, which is you've got the move to gate all around, you've got high-bandwidth memory, you've got a growing stack in NAND. It's part of the contribution of our share of WFE going from the low 30% to the high 30%. This would be representative of it to the best of my ability to answer your question.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that would be the best way to think about it is at the investor day, we said that as you move to these leading edge nodes, Lam's SAM as percent of WFE, our opportunity would grow from the low 30% to the high 30% through those transitions. Assuming these are at the leading edge, then you're starting to create an opportunity that's at that high 30% level.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nOkay. For my follow-up, I think in the past, you have mentioned the $40 billion TAM for NAND upgrades. How much of that will be completed by the end of the year? Like, will a third be completed? You know, will half be completed? Just any rough sense of where we are in the journey of that conversion. As you look at next year, I know you're not giving a specific WFE view, what would cause NAND growth to be different, you know, higher or lower than what you saw in what we have seen so far in 2025? Thank you.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nHere's what we said. When we were at the investor day back in February, we said that $40 billion would be spent. Obviously, we didn't exactly put a date on it, but we said over several years to satisfy the upgrade of the installed base to the 200-plus layer level. What I said in my remarks today is that bit demand being a little bit higher than prior expectations, we've likely seen a little bit of an acceleration of that upgrade. I also said that in 2026, our upgrade business in NAND would remain strong. We're not going to tell you exactly how far we are through that several-year period, but compared to February, it's accelerated. As I also mentioned, I think that if this demand for high-capacity storage continues, and the $40 billion when we gave that in February targeted kind of a mid-high teens bit demand.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that what you're hearing publicly right now is maybe demand that's a little bit higher than that. That would suggest it's being accelerated. All we can speak to is our demand would suggest the same thing.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Vivek.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe as a follow-up to C.J.'s question, you know, given all of these data center infrastructure announcements, I think, for example, Sam Altman's recent trip to Asia, he had a view that, you know, DRAM and advanced foundry supply requirements over the next several years would be X amount, right, which positively surprised all of us. It actually does imply significantly more capacity requirements across advanced foundry, memory, and advanced packaging. You would think that your customers would want to start to put this in place as quickly as possible, maybe starting next year. Tim, I think you did bring up a good point, right, which is on NAND, for example, that growth might be limited by tight clean room space. Do you think that overall growth in calendar 2026 WFE might be limited by availability of clean room space, not only in NAND, but across DRAM, advanced foundry, and advanced packaging?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI would say that, look, I can't speak for the customers. This would be a much better thing to ask them. They can do amazing things. I would say that generally, you know, there's a time that it takes to put in physical infrastructure. We suffer from the same thing, whether we're expanding labs or expanding manufacturing. Depending on what the demand is, it could be limited. I think what we're trying to respond to is the point of how much could you accelerate. That's a function of probably more physical space than it is ability for the equipment supply chain to respond. That's simply because our lead times are generally within the lead time of building a facility.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThat was kind of my general comment. Maybe we're not going to be the bottleneck. Clearly, we've seen some accelerated demand as a result of the current demand, but also in anticipation of those future opportunities. I would imagine this year you'll see some of those plans come to fruition. I would suggest you talk to the customers and find out what their physical plan investment plans are.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah, that's a fair point. Maybe for Doug, good to see the CSPG dynamics still on track to drive growth this year. I think the first nine months of this year, CSPG was up 7% year over year, but this includes Reliant. I assume that core spare services and upgrades are growing at a faster rate anyway to maybe quantify how much faster it's growing. If you could just true us up, I believe CSPG has been neutral to accretive to your overall operating margins, but you've got similar cost benefits as you've moved CSPG support closer to your customers, especially with the Malaysia buildout. Given all of this, on a relative basis, where do CSPG top margins currently sit relative to corporate average?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Harlan, let me unpack that a little bit. Just to remind everybody on the call, and Harlan, I know you know this, but for others, there's four components to CSPG: spares, service, upgrades, and then Reliant. Three of the components of CSPG are clearly growing. One is not, which is Reliant, largely because of maybe mature node spending across the whole world. Tim mentioned in his scripted remarks, you know, record spares and service combination. I said in my scripted remarks, hey, upgrades are pretty strong given what you got going on in NAND. That's the way to think through all of the kind of ups and downs, and CSPG is going to grow this year. You're right. CSPG is accretive to operating margin. I've never quantified that for anybody, but that continues to be the case.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nAppreciate the color. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, thanks, Harlan.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nGood evening. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe just give us a little bit of color on the NAND market and what you're seeing. I think clearly, given all the announcements that are out there in the market, there's the expectation that NAND orders could accelerate at some point. I'm sort of wondering your view on whether you're seeing that yet, whether you're seeing any kind of initial signals from customers in terms of longer-term forecasts and when we might start to see that show up in the numbers. Maybe as a follow-on to that, maybe comment on whether you expect 2026 growth in NAND to be led by upgrades or whether you see any potential for new tools starting to lead that. Thank you.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, thanks for the question. I think that, you know, I addressed some of that in my comments about NAND, but just to kind of go back and say that of the $40 billion of conversion spend that we had anticipated, I think the demand signal right now is a little bit accelerated than what we originally saw. That's based on the fact that bit demand is, people are speaking about bit demand that's a little bit higher than probably prior expectations. I think our business is going to continue to be predominantly upgrade-focused, you know, not only in 2025, but through 2026. That's primarily because there was a very large install base that had not been upgraded for a number of years. There are quite a few tools that can still be upgraded to provide those higher layer count devices.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nNow, as you do those upgrades, you tend to lose wafer out capacity. At some point, if demand remains as high as maybe people anticipate with these data center announcements, then I would think you would transition to capacity additions. My comment about floor space, physical infrastructure, again, a better question for our customers, but I would anticipate that everyone will remain focused on upgrades since it's the lowest cost and likely easiest way to achieve higher performance growth in bits through 2026. Beyond that, you know, it's, again, a better question for all the NAND providers to speak to their plans.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Jim.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nYeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Tim, I just want to follow up on the NAND thing. I understand clean room space is limited. Maybe Kyoshi has earlier on that as a new fab, but it also seems like the NAND utilization rate for most of your customers is heading towards 100%. I'm kind of curious, in that scenario, should we assume that there might be a quarter or two where your NAND orders or shipments drop off, or do you think it's going to be not like in lock and step, but it's going to be a pretty smooth transition?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, maybe I'll jump in and then, Tim, you can add. Krish, nothing goes up and to the right every single period. In fact, if you looked at the most recently reported quarter, NAND was actually down a little bit. It's going to continue to kind of trend towards that $40 billion, maybe a little bit more, but every quarter will have some level of variability depending on who's investing and what. You know, all these guys, or most of these guys, also have DRAM investments. They're going to modulate what happens in what quarter. Things have strengthened somewhat relative to what we were describing a quarter ago. Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, no, I think that's fair. I mean, I think the important thing to remember is that as we move above 200 layers, you know, the drivers for our business aren't just the increased bit demand. It basically is that to produce each of those bits, the intensity of Lam's equipment actually rises as well. Again, above 200 layers, we've talked about the fact that we start introducing several new types of products to deal with wafer stress, to deal with the higher gap fill requirements from the higher layer count devices. I talked a little bit about MOLE in my prepared remarks. For us, as we see more interest and perhaps a bit of acceleration in those upgrades, we think that it's a combination for us of upgrades to existing install base and the addition of some new tools.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYou'll see it within our business, both in systems and in upgrades.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nGot it. Thanks for that. A follow-up for Doug. Maybe it's a hypothetical question for you. You said next year WFE is going to grow. Kind of makes sense. Seems like most folks assume mid to high single digits growth in calendar 2026. I'm assuming in that setup, I understand Lam's revenues are going to grow year over year. With less China being a gross margin headwind and higher tax rate, can Lam's EPS also grow year over year in that situation or outgrow revenue?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYou're funny, Krish. You know, I'm not going to answer that question. Listen, but you have it right. I don't want to overposition the tax rate. The tax rate is going to go up just a little bit, okay? Don't go too far with it. Instead of low mid-teens, maybe it's approaching mid-teens or maybe a little bit towards the higher end of the low mid-teens. Don't go too far with that. The reduction of customer mix, though, will be a headwind for gross margin, right? We just took you down to 48.5%. Depending on how each quarter progresses, we're probably in that range for a while. As things grow, that's going to be beneficial from a fixed cost standpoint. We don't have huge fixed costs. There's going to be a customer mix headwind. Probably in the next year, tariffs are a little bit of a headwind too.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI don't know, anchor yourself plus or minus where we just guided you in December, I think. That'll be a good spot for you to start your models.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst)\nGot it. Thanks a lot, Doug. Appreciate it.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Krish.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nHi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Doug, for my first one, I wanted to zero into something you said about next year. You said a second half loaded year, but then you said the first half would be sort of flat to maybe up a bit versus the second half of 2025. If it's a second half loaded year, it feels to me like the second half ought to be up more materially than that. Am I sort of characterizing that trajectory correctly?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOh. I haven't given you any numbers for the second half, Stacy. I just said it's a second half weighted year. I said second half weighted, Stacy, and that the first half was flat to slightly up from the second half of this year.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nThe second half weighted to me means at least the second half of next year should be higher than the first half of next year, correct?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThat's what that means, yep.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nOkay, got it. I want to dig into the implications of that with regard to China. You said China drops below 30% next year. It's probably going to be, what, I don't know, 36% or something like this year. That drop would drop to like 29%. It'd be something like a $1.5 billion headwind, maybe more. It's probably a high single-digit headwind to revenue growth. From what we just heard, revenue overall should be growing. I mean, it feels like it should be growing okay, given the trajectory you just laid out, at least qualitatively. Again, I just want to know, do I have that dynamic correct? Can you give us maybe a little more color on the non-China offsets that are enabling you to overcome a headwind from China? Like I said, it has to be at least $1.5 billion, probably something in that range.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Stacy, what you just described is largely consistent with what I believe is going to happen next year. Yeah, China is going to be down. Your numbers probably aren't too far off. The global multinationals, though, are going to offset that, right? More than offset that is our assumption as we sit here today, right? Just think about what's going on, right? We've been talking about NAND a ton on the call. We've been talking about high-bandwidth memory. We've been talking about accelerators and all that kind of stuff going to more advanced nodes. That's what's going to be offsetting it, Stacy.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nI was actually just hoping to get a little more color on the granularity there, but maybe you're saving that for next quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, let us leave a little bit in our pocket for next quarter.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nAll right. Sounds good. Thank you, Doug. I appreciate it.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Stacy. Thanks for trying.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please proceed.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, thanks for letting me ask the questions. I just want to ask on China. Maybe I had it wrong. You didn't really answer it last quarter, but I thought the strength that you highlighted for September was going to be multinational spending in China. That's clearly not the case. Maybe you could just walk through why such a big bump to China revenue in September now that it's done?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, no, Blayne, if it came across that we were suggesting it was the multinationals in China, that wasn't what we intended to communicate. If we did, apologies for misrepresenting it. Listen, the multinationals in China stayed relatively steady, so call it flat-ish. The growth in China was largely driven by the domestic Chinese customer base.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nGotcha. Is the driver of the second half weighted, is that across all your segments, or is that more of a foundry logic comment?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe'll give you more granularity. I know everybody wants it now, but we'll give you more granularity on the December call. It's just a description of what we see across the totality of the spending in the industry, WFE in total.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nOkay, thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep, thanks, Blayne.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Melissa Weathers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (VP of Equity Research)\nHi there. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to check in on some of the new products that you introduced at the start of the year at your analyst day. Now that it seems like we're getting a little bit more momentum on the WFE side, have you seen any like acceleration in engagements on those new products, the Vantex CX+ and the Halo MOLE ALD products?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, that's a great question. We have. I mean, the Aqara and Halo, these are both products that are very focused on the inflections that are taking place in foundry, logic, DRAM, and NAND. Aqara for conductor edge, high aspect ratio, very well suited as we scale in all around and also heavily used in DRAM. We've talked about a couple of wins since February in some DRAM conductor edge applications. Again, remember, we introduced some of these products specifically to improve, you know, our performance and revenue growth in foundry, logic, DRAM because of the drivers there. Halo, I talked about on this call, again, continuing to make progress in securing 3D NAND word line applications, which is an important step for the ESSD performance.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI would say we're, you know, where I sit right now, you know, there's a long way to go to deliver on the investor day full model. I think from a product perspective and how we see the transitions playing out, we're feeling pretty good about the progress we've made since February.\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (VP of Equity Research)\nThank you. Maybe one more on the backside power side of things. It looks like backside power nodes are going to start to ramp in volume next year or maybe the year after. Has anything changed on either the timing or the magnitude of what you're expecting for backside power contributions in the next couple of quarters or years?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think in terms of change, as you move forward and you hear all about the requirements and challenges of power in these very compute-intensive devices, it just gives us further confidence that you need solutions like backside power. It directly addresses some of the issues that customers have in scaling performance of high compute devices. It is an etch-depth intensive inflection, and therefore it's important for us to be focused on it. I think we'll do well as those nodes ramp.\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (VP of Equity Research)\nThank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Melissa.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please proceed.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst of Technology Hardware)\nYes, thanks for taking my question. All the good questions have been asked, so I have a quick follow-up. Going back to your slide number six, interesting observation. I understand the facility construction lead times are in a one to two year, and that's almost in a ballpark as a leading edge fab. I would also argue that there is increased concentration within that $8 billion of WFE for every $100 billion of incremental AI. That increased concentration would, in my opinion, give your customers some leeway. They don't have to rush to secure capacity or to release all their POs. I'm just wondering if you have any additional thoughts to it. Is that a factor?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nMehdi, that's a good question. I'm not exactly sure how to answer it. I think Tim has been meeting with a lot of customers over the last couple of weeks and having conversations about, okay, what do you think next year looks like? Where are you going and so forth? I don't know that lead times have been all that different, so to speak, at least not yet. I'm not sure I'm answering your question. I'm just kind of rambling here a little bit.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst of Technology Hardware)\nI would think your customers don't have to worry about running out of capacity among their suppliers.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that, look, in whether it's us and how we work with our customers, or I'm sure our customers, how they work with theirs, everybody wants to make sure they have what they need. We spend a lot of time with our supply chain making sure they have the capacity, they're ramped, they understand our plans. You can anticipate that our customers do the same thing with us to ensure that when they take an order, they can deliver it. I think we're in a period right now, as we talked about, of some acceleration. I think, you know, I don't believe most people anticipated the number of announcements that have come in recent months for, you know, AI infrastructure.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIt will take time for those, but I can guarantee when people hear those announcements, it ripples through the supply chain to make sure that capacity is going to exist. I think everybody goes to work. If there's one thing that Lam Research has been good at, it is executing to the needs of our customers, and that continues to be our focus.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst of Technology Hardware)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Mehdi.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please proceed.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nYeah, hey, Doug and Tim. Just a quick question on 2026. As you look at the strength that you mentioned into next year, is that being driven by memory or foundry as well? It looks like DRAM and pricing have been especially strong. Just wondering what you're seeing on the memory side as well.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nVijay, I think it's probably going to come from both. We'll give you more color on the December call.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nGot it. As you look at 2026, obviously there's a U.S. ITC that kicks in December 31 for a higher investment tax credit, like 35%. It looks like some CHIPS Act money is starting to flow again. Are you seeing that as a tailwind for WFE into next year or?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nMaybe only on the margin, Vijay. No, what's driving WFE next year is end demand at the end of the day. Yeah, I'm sure the investment tax credit is going to maybe influence a little bit of the geographic distribution of that, maybe a little bit. End demand is what matters right now.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nGot it. Thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Vijay. Operator, we will take one more set of questions, sorry.\n\n**Operator**\nOkay. The final question will come from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. Please proceed.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director of Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nHi, thanks for taking our questions. Appreciate it. Maybe the first one, going back to that popular slide in the slide deck, of the $8 billion in WFE spending, on a kind of rough cut, could you partition that across on a % basis? Advanced logic, DRAM, and NAND.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nBrian, more than half of it is coming from memory.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director of Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nMore than half.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nEnterprise SSDs and high-bandwidth memory. Clearly, the great big GPU accelerators, the ASICs and whatnot are an important part of it, but more than half is memory.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director of Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nOkay, that's helpful. Going back to the $40 billion mass in terms of upgrades over several years, do you view that as having to the industry having to sort of exhaust that and then capacity spending occurs, or can they be somewhat concurrent maybe towards the back end of that, maybe kind of more customer by customer basis as opposed to CPU?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, I'll take that. I think just as you said there, it's going to be a customer by customer situation. Already today, we're seeing some capacity additions, and that has nothing to do with end demand. That was the customer's plan all along. I think you find different customers at different points of where they are with their installed base, where they are with the needs of their customers and end markets. The great thing for Lam is that we can work with customers in a very agnostic way as to whether they're gaining the bits and performance they need through upgrades or through capacity adds. We participate in both in a meaningful way. I think you'll see both. However, what I said was upgrades to installed base tend to be the fastest and lowest cost means of achieving bits at the higher performance.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that most customers will prioritize that first before they get to capacity. There will be some concurrence and maybe, as you said, towards the back end of that upgrade rollout.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director of Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nThat's right. Great, thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, thank you, Brian. Operator, with that, we're going to conclude the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. I know Tim and I will be talking to a lot of you during the remainder of the quarter before we get into the quiet period. Thanks for your interest in Lam Research.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThank you.",

With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Ram, and good afternoon, everyone. Lam delivered another great quarter. Revenues and profitability came in at the upper end of our guided ranges. Our gross margins exceeded 50% for the first time since the merger of Lam and Novellus, and EPS hit a new high for the company. We achieved record foundry revenues driven by strong performance in both gate all-around and mature node markets. Our upgrades business grew to a new high, up mid-teens % over the prior quarter as NAND customers migrate to higher layer count, higher performance devices to meet the faster read-write requirements and greater storage demands of AI applications. In short, we are executing well on the served market expansion and share growth story we laid out at our investor day earlier this year.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\n3D scaling of device and advanced packaging architectures is accelerating growth in etch and deposition intensity, and Lam's new products targeting key technology inflections are winning with customers. Furthermore, in advanced services, Lam is at the forefront of realizing the vision of an autonomous fab. We are gaining momentum with our equipment intelligence-enabled Dextro cobots, which provide device makers with an unprecedented level of equipment maintenance precision and repeatability. The result is enhanced tool-to-tool matching, improved machine availability, lower operational costs, and in some cases, higher yield. In the June quarter, Lam expanded our Dextro capabilities to cover three additional tool types, and we are accelerating the roadmap to support more products and more shipments in coming quarters.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nTurning to the overall market environment for calendar year 2025, we expect wafer fabrication equipment or WFE spending to be in the $105 billion range, up from our prior view of approximately $100 billion, predominantly due to an uptick in domestic China-related spending. We see non-China investments remaining broadly consistent with our prior view. Currently, we expect WFE in the second half of the calendar year to be roughly flat with the first half. Looking forward to 2026, it is still too early to comment on the overall level of WFE spending. However, with our strong position in gate all-around, advanced packaging, high bandwidth memory, and NAND layer conversions, we feel confident that Lam is well positioned to outperform.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIn 2025, Lam's served available market, or SAM, is set to expand to around mid-30% of WFE due to these industry drivers, and we expect them to work in Lam's favor again in 2026. Longer term, we are on a solid path to grow our SAM to the high 30% range of WFE by continuing to deliver critical solutions for atomic-level device scaling, new materials innovation, and advanced packaging integration. The key R&D investments that we've made over the last several years have enabled us to create the broadest, most competitive product portfolio in the company's history, thereby putting us in a strong position to win over 50% share of the incremental SAM over time. I'll share a couple of examples that underscore our early progress toward our SAM expansion and share gain goals. First is our Halo ALD Mali tool, which is ramping at multiple NAND customers this year.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe expect Mali adoption to increase broadly as more customers convert NAND capacity to 200 layers and higher in the next few years. Lam is leading the industry transition to ALD Mali, not only in NAND but also in foundry logic. AI is driving greater transistor performance requirements and, in turn, accelerating the inflection to gate all-around device architectures. However, below two nanometers, gate all-around structures begin to encounter significant resistance capacitance, or RC, challenges. Narrower transistor contacts in these devices cause greater electron scattering, resulting in higher resistance of the deposited tungsten films. Replacing tungsten with molybdenum solves the resistance problem, but the process of depositing this higher performance material is inherently slower and more complex. This is driving a roughly 3x increase in Lam metal deposition SAM per wafer when transitioning to advanced gate all-around nodes.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nToday, we are the only company with ALD Mali tools already in production in foundry logic, and in the June quarter, we secured a key win at another leading foundry customer for their next-generation application. As Mali adoption expands across various metal interconnect layers, the flexibility of Lam's unique multi-station architecture to execute both plasma and thermal processing in the same chamber enables optimization of process conditions and process step sequencing to meet requirements for different applications and over multiple generations of future logic devices. Another area where we have made strong progress is advanced packaging. Advanced packaging is critical for scaling system performance to address next-generation AI requirements, and so far has enabled up to 100% improvement in memory density, 4x improvement in bandwidth, and an approximate 40% gain in power efficiency.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nLam's SAM is growing with greater adoption of next-generation packaging architectures for DRAM, CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs used in data centers. In 2021, leading-edge foundry logic customers spent just 1% of WFE on advanced packaging. With AI's rapid adoption of advanced packaging, that number has grown more than 6x. In the future, we expect end-consumer devices like mobile application processors and laptop CPUs to also feature more complex packaging schemes as on-device AI becomes mainstream. We are a leader in the advanced packaging inflection and are leveraging our experience to win more opportunities. For example, Lam has amassed unmatched experience in copper plating hardware design and process technology over the last 20 years. We have by far the largest installed base in the industry and recently achieved a significant milestone of 6,000 installed plating cells.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nBy incorporating our learning from the installed base into improvements in our latest Sabre 3D system, we are delivering best-in-class coplanarity, uniformity, and defectivity in high-volume advanced packaging environments. The experience we have gained at the leading edge is now cascading to additional wins with next-tier customers seeking to adopt a proven best-in-class solution. Sabre 3D market share in advanced packaging is expected to grow nearly 5 points year-on-year in calendar 2025. Finally, let me pivot to the strong momentum we're seeing with our newest generation etch tools. In NAND, we continue to solidify our leadership in high-aspect ratio dielectric etch. Equipped with our Cryo process, our Vantex CX+ system recently won a key multi-generation etch decision at a major NAND customer. This further confirms our differentiation in both technology innovation and high-volume production worthiness in the NAND segment.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAcross all device types, our state-of-the-art conductor etch tool, Akara, is off to a solid start since its launch earlier this year. By combining direct power coupling with Lam's unique plasma pulsing capabilities, Akara delivers industry-leading depth uniformity and profile control that is vital for DRAM scaling. In the June quarter, Akara secured multiple new application wins at a top DRAM maker. To wrap up, I'm excited by the breadth of opportunities I see ahead for the company and am encouraged by the outstanding progress our team has already made toward the long-term goals we communicated at our February investor day. Etch and deposition intensity is rising with 3D scaling. Our products are winning in key technology inflections, and as a result, there is tremendous potential for Lam to continue expanding SAM and to grow share at each successive process technology node.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nNow, here's Doug to talk about our quarterly financial performance and the September outlook.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nExcellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. We executed well in the June 2025 quarter, including delivering a record gross margin percentage of 50.3% in the post-Novellus period. These past two quarters represent Lam's highest gross margin percentage since we merged the companies in 2012. Our June quarter financial results came in above the midpoint of all of our guidance ranges, with earnings per share actually exceeding the guidance range. For our 2025 fiscal year, we had record revenue of $18.4 billion and gross margin of 48.8%. Our free cash flow generation fiscal 2025 was 29% of revenue and approximately $5.4 billion, which was also a record for the company in dollar terms.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe're delivering on the profitability objectives discussed at our investor day earlier this year through a growing top line, favorable mix, and strong operational execution. Let's look at the details of our June quarter results. Revenue came in at $5.17 billion, which was an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was $2.68 billion, which was an increase of approximately $670 million from the March quarter. This was related to customer advance down payments from several newer customers. From a market segment perspective, June quarter systems revenue in the foundry segment represented 52% of our systems revenue, an increase from the percentage concentration in the March quarter of 48%. In dollar terms, this level represents a second consecutive record quarter, and we also set a new record from a fiscal year perspective.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe benefited from continued momentum in leading-edge processes as well as investments in mature nodes by domestic Chinese customers. Memory was 41% of systems revenue, a slight decrease from the prior quarter level of 43%. Non-volatile memory came in at 27% of our systems revenue, which was higher than the March quarter's level of 20%. We continue to encourage you to think of NAND investments focused primarily on upgrades, which we anticipate will require an investment of roughly $40 billion over several years. DRAM declined from the March quarter, coming in at 14% of systems revenue compared with 23% last quarter. The decline in the June quarter was related to the timing of certain customer projects. For the 2025 fiscal year, DRAM revenue reached a new record in dollar terms with spending focused on technology upgrades to the one-beta and one-gamma nodes enabling DDR5 and LPDDR5.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nHigh bandwidth memory was also a key investment area. The logic and other segment came in at 7% of systems revenue in the June quarter, slightly lower than the prior quarter level of 9%. Now, I'll go through the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 35%, an increase from the prior quarter level of 31%. We saw increasing investment from global multinational customers in this region to the highest level since the December quarter of 2022. The majority of our China revenue, nonetheless, continued to come from domestic Chinese customers. The next largest geographic concentration were Korea at 22% and Taiwan at 19% of revenue in the June quarter, both of which were a decrease from 24% concentration in the March quarter. Japan revenue at 14% was a record for Lam Research in dollar terms.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThe customer support business group revenue in the June quarter totaled approximately $1.7 billion, consistent with the March quarter as well as the June quarter of a year ago. We had a third consecutive record quarter for upgrade revenue driven by NAND technology convergence. We also saw strength in our spares business, offset by a decline in reliant systems. Sitting here today, we do think we will see modest growth in CSPG for the calendar year. Let's look at profitability. The June quarter gross margin came in at 50.3%, close to the top end of our guided range and improving from the March quarter level of 49%. The increase is tied to a stronger mix and continued progress in our operational efficiencies from our close-to-customer manufacturing strategy. Operating expenses for the June quarter were $822 million, up from the prior quarter level of $763 million.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThis was a bit higher than our original estimate coming into the quarter, primarily due to increased incentive compensation tied to the company's improved profitability. R&D accounted for 69% of total operating expenses. The June quarter operating margin was 34.4% and near the high end of our guidance. This operating profit represents a record level for Lam Research in both dollars as well as percentage terms. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in at 4.8%. As I indicated on the last earnings call, the rate in the June quarter reflects a tax reserve release tied to a statute of limitations expiration. Our estimate for the September 2025 quarter is for the tax rate to be back in the low to mid-teens range. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $4 million in income, compared with $7 million in expense in the March quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThe improvement in OI&E was primarily the result of increased interest income tied to a higher cash balance, as well as gains on our venture investment portfolio. As we've talked about in the past, you should expect to see variability in OI&E quarter to quarter. For capital return in the June quarter, we allocated approximately $1.3 billion to share buybacks through a combination of open market share repurchases and an accelerated share repurchase program. That ASR will continue to execute into the September quarter. We also paid $295 million in dividends. The June quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.33, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, driven by that higher revenue, stronger gross margin performance, and the lower tax rate. The diluted share count was 1.28 billion shares, which was a reduction from the March quarter and was consistent with our guidance.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe have $7.5 billion remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. Let me pivot to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.4 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase from $5.5 billion at the end of the March quarter. The main reason for the cash increase was cash from operating activities, including those customer advance down payments, which was partially offset by cash allocated to the share buyback, dividends, and capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 59 days in the June quarter, which was down from 62 days in the March quarter. June quarter inventory turns improved to 2.4 times, compared with 2.2 times in the prior quarter. We're making progress in managing inventory levels and will continue to work on this as we go forward.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOur non-cash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $94 million in equity compensation, $86 million in depreciation, and $12 million in amortization. Capital expenditures were $172 million, which was down from the March quarter level of $288 million. Spending in the June quarter was mainly centered on lab investments in the United States and Asia, as well as manufacturing facilities in Asia, supporting our global strategy to be close to our customers' development and manufacturing locations. I would point out that offsetting this capital spending, we received more than $50 million in benefits through the advanced manufacturing investment credit, as well as other CHIPS Act-related programs. We ended the June quarter with approximately 19,000 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 400 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount increases primarily within R&D to support the long-term product roadmap.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIn addition, we had increases within the factory and field organizations for increasing manufacturing activities and a higher volume of tool installations. Let's look at our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2025 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $5.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million. We expect stronger China revenue driven by foundry spending in the September quarter. We're expecting gross margin of 50%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This guidance includes our current assessment of the direct impact of tariffs on our business. Operating margins of 34%, plus or minus 1 percentage point, and finally, earnings per share of $1.20, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 1.27 billion shares. Let me wrap up. In completing the first half of the calendar year 2025, I was pleased that we made solid progress on the objectives we shared at the beginning of the year.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nSitting here today, as Tim mentioned, we now see WFE relatively balanced half on half. We continue to prioritize strategic investments that extend our technology leadership, operational efficiencies, and profitability, which reinforces our long-term value creation agenda. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nI guess first question, your tool business is likely growing three times the growth rate of WFE here in calendar 2025, and you indicated expectations for relative outperformance to continue in calendar 2026. Is there a framework for thinking about rank order of the key drivers of this outperformance that you could share?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nSure. I think it's all the things we've talked about in the past. I mean, clearly, if we look at foundry logic. I mentioned extensively the discussion of Mali today, but we're also looking at other tools around the gate all-around structure. It's things like selective etch, ALD. We still have backside power to come. That will be an area, we believe, of outperformance for Lam, given our strength in etch and deposition and the role that it plays there.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe continue to see ourselves gaining against WFE the more that advanced packaging is incorporated across every type of device, whether it's foundry logic, HBM, and even in NAND, you're starting to see on every NAND maker's roadmap things like cell bonded to array or cell under array. Really, as I look to the future, it basically is one in which depth and etch intensity just continues to rise faster than WFE. Lam has an incredibly strong position already and a portfolio of products that are just doing great in the marketplace. I think if we continue to stay focused and execute, it'll be those technology drivers that will carry us forward.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. Then a question for you, Doug. In terms of gross margins, you've got, it sounds like, some tailwind from China.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nCurious, does that continue into the December quarter, and is there kind of a new normalized gross margin X kind of China that we should be thinking about?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Tim, we are benefiting from a favorable mix, both customer as well as a little bit of product. We do have some level of headwinds as I look forward. Tariffs are ticking up a little bit. I don't expect, as we get into the December quarter, we're going to continue to have quite as favorable of a level of mix. I'll be pretty direct about how I want everybody thinking about the December gross margin. You should be kind of thinking about where consensus is today, which is about 48%. I think that's what you're going to see in December.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI'm not going to get over the skis yet in terms of what you should be thinking about as we head into next year, because I'm not exactly sure what the mix is going to be, C.J., but I'll give you very direct guidance on December, which I just did.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, C.J. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Doug, so taking your comment about gross margin being down a smidge, and I know it doesn't have a lot to do with volume, and also looking at the commentary about WFE being pretty flat half on half, I know you're going to gain share on the system side during the back half of the year for sure. Can you give us just a little bit of a sense?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nDo you think that December revenue is down as well, just like gross margin, or do you think it's pretty flat?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Tim, you should think about our revenue likely mirroring what we described WFE to be, right? We told you we think WFE is roughly flat, half on half, flat-ish. If you think through that, you know what March was. You know that both June and September are roughly the same revenue level, so you should conclude the December quarter looked largely top line-wise like March did, roughly.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Okay. So it is down. Okay.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, it will be down. It will be down, and that's part of the gross margin, Tim.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nYeah. Okay. Cool. Can you just talk about, just, there's a lot of puts and takes for next year.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nI know there was a pretty big CapEx cut from a big logic maker, but it sounds like you still feel like the bias to next year, I mean, you're not giving us a number, but if you had to, you would say that the bias to next year is up. Is that fair?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe're not going to give a 2026 number, but I think that what we're trying to do is frame out that regardless of what WFE is, we think that the drivers of WFE spending are significantly in Lam's favor. I think that it's just too early. There are a tremendous number of projects in play right now. It's hard to know exact timing. If you look, what are the drivers for 2026, 2027, 2028? It's what I just talked about in the last question: HBM, advanced packaging, gate all-around, NAND layer scaling, Mali.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe didn't talk about, I didn't mention dry resist, EUV patterning. These are all areas where Lam has new products that have been in our customer's R&D facilities for the last several years. They're ready to go. We don't control the customer's project timing, but we feel incredibly confident that when those projects go, Lam expands our SAM and gains share. That might be 2026. It might be 2027. Our strategy doesn't change at this point based on the customer's timing. We're in the right position.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nTotally. Got it. Thank you.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYep. Thanks, Tim.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nHey, guys. Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. Your China business was strong in the June quarter, was up about 20% sequentially.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nIs the team still embedding about a $700 million negative impact from China in the second half of this year due to the restrictions that were put in place back in December? Irrespective of that, on top of all of this, you're anticipating a better overall China business this year, right? Relative to 90 days ago, what has changed within your China customer base? Do you think that this is potential pull forward of equipment ahead of any potential tariffs, or just more focused on bringing manufacturing capabilities domestically, just given the choppy geopolitical environment?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nHarlan, you stuck like three or four questions in there. Let me try. That $700 million number, that was revenue we had identified to specific customers. Regulations haven't changed, so that's no different.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI think when we think about the fact that WFE is a little bit stronger and it's driven by a little bit more spending in China, it's just a little bit more spending from a handful of customers is how I would be thinking about it. It's nearly impossible for us to say it's a pull-in because of any specific reason. They're just spending a little bit more when we unpack it.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you for that. Maybe for Tim, as we track a lot of these next-generation AI XPU and GPU programs, many of them are moving from 2.5D to 3D packaging. On the flip side, your memory customers, as you pointed out, are gearing up for a strong migration to HBM4 next year. Some of them are actually signaling increases in spending in the second half of this year, right, versus their expectations coming into the year.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nI think you guys did greater than $1 billion in advanced packaging and HBM last year. You came into this year targeting greater than $3 billion in advanced packaging and gate all-around. If you just single out advanced packaging, is that business coming in better versus your expectations entering this year? Is that what is also helping to drive maybe a slightly better second-half shipment and revenue profile?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIt's a little bit, Harlan. I think advanced packaging in total is probably a little bit stronger than we expected. It's not wildly stronger, but HBM is strong, and there's probably a little bit of upside related to that as well as the China stuff we were talking about.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nHarlan, I would just say from a technology perspective, you kind of hit it. The packaging schemes are getting more complex. You mentioned 2.5D to 3D.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI've always said for years now, you hear 3D, you should think of Lam. That means vertical scaling. It means more etch and deposition. HBM 3E to 4E obviously does things that are beneficial for us, both from an advanced packaging perspective, but also from a front-end equipment perspective. The die size, cell size gets a little bit bigger. The die gets bigger because of increased number of TSVs to feed the higher IO count. By our estimate, and I think some of our customers' commentary, you need approximately 30% more wafers to produce an equivalent number of bits when you move from 3E to 4E. As AI performance requirements continue to demand these greater capabilities, we're just seeing increased WFE in the etch and deposition spaces. Similarly, SSD speeds, when you talk, I mentioned CBA, which is another packaging-enabled capability, that's being directly put in for performance.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIt's part of the ability to create higher performance for SSDs, higher read-write speeds. I think that everywhere these kind of packaging capabilities are being leveraged for performance and next-gen capabilities.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director)\nThanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Harlan.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them too. Doug, I just want to clarify one thing on China sales. If I heard you right, you said the multinationals grew relatively more in June versus March. If true, do you think it was because of potential for restrictions on tools for MNCs in China, or do you think something else was going on?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nNo, Krish. Again, it's hard to isolate, \"Hey, spending was a little stronger. What was the reason?\" I don't know that I would specifically identify it to that.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYes, you picked up on the commentary exactly right. The global multinationals in China grew by more than 90% quarter over quarter. There was a big increase in spending from that, and that contributed to part of the uptick you saw in the China regional spending.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Very helpful. Then follow-up for Tim. Tim, on the 2-nanometer gate all-around, especially the leading Taiwan foundries, are all the tool decisions already made, or do you think there are still some PTORs that are still in flux?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOh, Krish, I don't want to take any one specific customer where they are in timing, but I would say that. Look, I mean, when we're not the guy in position, we're fighting right to the end until production fabs are built.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI would say that from the big drivers of SAM expansion and share gains, we've been looking forward past 2 nanometers for quite some time, and a number of things I talked about in terms of inflections are beyond 2 nanometers. I just highlighted Mali adoption and foundry logic. Dry resist. There's a lot coming beyond, and we're already well engaged with those more advanced applications. Probably the best I can say without talking too much about one customer.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thanks a lot, Tim. Thanks, Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Krish.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to zero in again on China. The multinational was clearly the source of the upside in the quarter. Is it the local spending that's the upside in the September quarter and the multinational you see sustaining?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nI guess, given all of that, given the decline you're guiding for for December quarter, is that pretty much just China normalizing into December, or is there something else going on there?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nStacy, I'm not going to break down the specificity of the regional composition for the guide, but China is up in the quarter. Yeah, you've got December. You're thinking about December in the right way.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nGot it. Got it. There's nothing else going on unusual in December. It's mostly just the China normalization. I mean, the gross margin guide seems to indicate that as well.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. Revenue is going to be a little bit softer in December, just normal profile. Mix is a little bit softer in December. We're kind of back to a little bit of a run rate. Frankly, Stacy, you should also be thinking about tariffs, right?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nTariffs are a little bit higher in the December quarter than they are in September. There's a lot of moving pieces, I guess, is why I'm rambling on here a little bit.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nYeah. Yeah. No, I hear you. For my follow-up, I just want to ask about Taiwan. I thought you said foundry was at a record level, but Taiwan was actually down sequential, I guess. I'm just having a little bit of trouble squaring that. What am I missing?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nTaiwan last quarter was 24% revenue. This quarter, it was 19%. Revenue was up. On a like-for-like basis, Taiwan was down a little bit. Understand, Taiwan's not the only geographic location where there's foundries in the world, right? There's foundries all over the globe.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nWhere are you seeing the foundry spending picking up then?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI'm not going to break down the geographic distribution, but there's a leading-edge foundry investing in Japan. There's trailing-edge foundry spending in China as well as globally. It's a little bit all over, Stacy. Japan, I would point out to you, I mentioned this, record revenue in the Japan region. I think you probably know there's a large new foundry in Japan.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nYeah. That's what I'm trying to tie out. Thank you very much. Helpful.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep. You're welcome.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Relative to your outlook on 2026, realize it's very early and you don't want to give a view there. Do you have confidence that Lam's business can actually grow in 2026, even if CapEx is not up for the broader industry?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe're not going to give a good number for next year. The important thing, and I think Tim described this well, listen, etch and dep is a % of total WFE we see growing. We feel extraordinarily good about the strength of the product portfolio right now, such that we reiterated, Tim reiterated today, that of this expanding SAM, we're going to gain 50% of it is our view of things. At the end of the day, we're only halfway through 2025, so we're not going to quite stick our neck out about 2026 yet. It'll be what it'll be, but we feel great about our relative outperformance into the next several years. That was the important message, Jim, that we tried to deliver.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nUnderstandable. I had to give it the rookie try. Just a second question as a follow-up.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nJust wondering, obviously, NAND was a pretty good step up in the quarter. Do you see that strength sustaining through the end of the year or the next couple of quarters from where you stand today, or is it sort of like a pop-up and pop-down potentially?Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nListen, Jim, I'm also not going to get into the quarterly breakdown of NAND spending. The important thing, though, and we reiterated this and we said it back at the investor day, is you should think about NAND over the next several years needing to spend roughly $40 billion to work through technology conversions, upgrades, if you will. Our view of that hasn't changed. That's the most important thing to think about. The spending profile over the next several years, we see continuing.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThe only thing I would add as well is, while there's this focus on upgrades, we're also significantly advancing the technologies. I mentioned a couple of the items. The demands of AI for both storage and speed and density is driving things like the Mali adoption that I talked about. It's driving the CBA that I talked about. It's also driving QLC to get density. QLC, I talked about a win we had for cryo etching. Cryo produces a much more vertical, high-aspect ratio dielectric memory hole. That's a critical capability that helps enable QLC. You're looking at multiple technology drivers.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIf you just look at layer count itself, over the last couple of years, we've been talking about all the other drivers, whether it's backside deposition for stress management, our carbon gap fill for tier stacking, and eventually, back to advanced packaging, the question we had there, you start stacking cells on top of cells to go to very high layer counts. From an etch and deposition perspective, we're going to get a lot of upgrades to the install base, but you're also going to see a lot of new tools get pulled in in the future to help enable these technology advancements that are needed both for performance and cost scaling.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Jim. Welcome on board.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. Doug, you talked about modest growth in CSBG this year.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nI understand you don't want to talk about WFE next year, but is it safe to assume that the CSBG business snaps back next year in a more meaningful way, given the restrictions and all that that has happened in China over the years and normalizes?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYou guys all want us to give you next year, and I'm just not going to do it, Atif. Listen, the way to think about CSBG, though, is consistent with how you should be thinking about it over the last several years, right? Chamber count grows every year. That creates incremental opportunity for us to kind of grow spares, upgrade service, and so forth. We're really excited about the advanced servicing. Tim talked about equipment intelligence and cobots. That's cool stuff. We're super jazzed about that. I'm not sure exactly how Reliance is going to play out next year.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIt is down a good amount this year. I'm hopeful that it does better next year, but I'm just not ready to kind of give you specificity. The tailwinds you've always seen in CSBG continue to be there.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI want to, basically just to add on, the strong performance in CSBG can show up in ways that aren't just CSBG revenue. I think that's why we talk about advanced services, and I mentioned all the benefits that we see coming with equipment intelligence and our Dextro cobots, things like better machine availability, more repeatability of maintenance cycle to maintenance cycle. These things ultimately have an impact on how the customer feels about our tool as the most production-worthy system for not only this current generation of manufacturing, but all future. I think that we look at these two businesses, the CSBG business and our systems business, as very synergistic.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThe better we do in advanced services, the better we're going to do in terms of gaining share on the system side. I think we're investing in advanced services with that in mind, not just for its own revenue-generating purposes.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Adam.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask on DRAM. Obviously, AI is super strong. I think there's a lot of concerns about maybe some inventory on the HBM side. Obviously, smaller business for you and lumpy, but just kind of curious what you're seeing in DRAM and kind of any perspective for the rest of the year.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that if we look kind of to the second half of the year, maybe the only comment I'd let Doug add is we have seen some HBM-related strength.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nHBM is definitely the hot thing in DRAM right now. When we look at it, while it's been hot, we view there being a long road ahead. Some of the data we looked at, it's only something like 7% of total DRAM bits will actually be HBM in 2025. We don't know where that goes, but it looks like a long tailwind of build-out in HBM. I talked about the impact of the changes from HBM 3E to HBM 4E and whatever comes beyond that and how it's impacting the number of wafers required to produce the same number of bits. Those are things that expand WFE overall, but within that, etch is becoming more critical as well as you have to execute more precision to build these more advanced DRAMs. I think it shouldn't be overlooked the importance of the new Akara wins that I talked about within DRAM.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAs you mentioned, it hasn't been a big business for us, but we're gaining share in DRAM. I think that as we gain share in an expanding market, that's a great twofer. We're really pretty positive about DRAM momentum right now.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nThanks. I just want to ask Doug on gross margin for December. Is there anything more than the geographic mix? I thought you said product mix, but then it would seem like kind of falling off the head one as well. Maybe you could clarify what you meant when you said product.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. There's customer mix, there's a little bit of product mix, and frankly, there's a little bit of tariff showing up incrementally in December. Those are the things to be thinking about, Blayne. Frankly, overall revenue levels too. I think I told you December is going to be down a little bit.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThere are a lot of moving pieces in gross margin. All of that contributes some portion to it.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nGotcha. When you say customer, it's related to the geographic mix.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThere are some smaller customers in China, and that tends to be what I'm describing when I say customer mix. It's not specific to any one region. It's just there are smaller customers.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nThanks for that.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep. Thanks, Blayne.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Jay Rakesh with Jefferies. Pardon me, from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nYeah. Hey, thanks a lot. Just wondering on the WFE side, I think you have the ITC, the investment tax rate going to 35%. Do you see that driving a tailwind to WFE as you look at next year in a follow-up?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nVijay, not that I can specifically correlate. Might there be?\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nThere might be, but I've not deeply sat down and thought about this or tried to correlate. It's probably something I need to do. Got it. On the China side, obviously, good to see the pickup there. As you look out, do you expect that mix to kind of normalize, kind of mean revert to where you guys were, maybe early in the year or last year? Thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Vijay, it's a good question. I told you, I think September's up in China. I think December's probably going to lighten up a little bit. Previously, we described the view that last year to this year, China as a percent of total mix was going to be down. I think it's probably going to be flat to maybe slightly down. It got a little bit stronger, and that was part of why Tim described an uptick in WFE.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Vijay.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\n**Edward Yang** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nHi, Tim. Doug, thanks for the time. Congrats on the strong quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter where you've not only beat numbers, but the guidance has also exceeded consensus by double digits. Taking that into context, if you look at that record, is it just more conservatism in your planning, or what has kind of surprised you by this magnitude?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIf you unpack it, revenue came in a little bit better. Gross margin came in a little bit better. Frankly, that tax rate came in a little bit lower. I don't know that I would describe a conservative bias, but that's just kind of how the quarter unfolded. You might point out that happens at Lam Research more often than not. Maybe.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThat tax rate was lower than we expected for sure. It's a little bit of all of it.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that also. Not to say much about the conservatism piece, but in general, we're also in an environment where a lot of the markets that we're selling to, look at the number, I hate to say the number of times I had to mention AI, but the reality is you've seen AI and demand generally exceeding expectations here. It's driving demand for chips. Because so much of the more advanced requirements are for etch and deposition, we're outperforming that. Maybe it's just us wanting to see it before we really commit to it. I think we're getting a better and better view of how these technology transitions are occurring.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that's what's giving us confidence that we, I think, well telegraphed at our investor day earlier this year where we talked about pretty aggressive 2028 and trillion-dollar semiconductor industry goals for the company.\n\n**Edward Yang** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThanks for that perspective, Tim. My next question is just on mobile and your thoughts on that end market. The carriers have been reporting really strong handset sales lately. Verizon, AT&T, there are upgrades, were up 20%. This is after a long stretch of flat. Hard to know what's behind it. I think one of the carriers called it tariff pull-ins. The other denied it. It feels like maybe we're starting a meaningful shift there. If we are in the early stages of a broader handset refresh cycle, how would that affect Lam Research across Logic, DRAM, and NAND?\n\n**Edward Yang** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nCan you size your exposure, and are your ASPs in that segment above or below your corporate average?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. It's a great question. We're one step removed from smartphones and PC sales. The way it shows up for us, though, at the end of the day, yeah, I do see a little bit of growth in mobile. I see a little bit of growth in client, PC client. Frankly, content is growing, right? When you look at the new phones coming out this year, there's more DRAM. There's more NAND. There are bigger baseband chips as AI becomes a thing. That happens in PCs as well, right? There's not a huge unit story in PCs, although they're up, I don't know, low single digits this year. There's a content story there with terabyte. In fact, I'm starting to see two terabyte PCs. That's what shows up for us.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIt'll show up with our large foundry customers at the leading edge and the DRAM customers that are selling HBM and, frankly, the NAND customers that are selling SSDs. That's how it shows up in our business.\n\n**Edward Yang** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYou're welcome. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Diane Chin with STEEPO. Please go ahead.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe first, is the Vantex Oxide Etch win you referenced, is that for a 400-layer application?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI'm not going to comment on exactly which technology node it is, but when I said multi-generational, you can interpret that as being everything from current generation through the next couple of generations. It's an important win because, again, customers tend to pick a new type of tool with the idea that they'll reuse that tool. They'll upgrade that tool for multiple technology nodes.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, it's a significant win for us.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nMaybe just a quick follow-up on that, though, Tim. Do you think that the selection, if it's to be implemented at more recent nodes, suggests maybe a faster ramp upward in terms of vertical scaling?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nVantex has been in the marketplace for quite a while. I think, as you know, there's been a lot of talk over the last couple of years about leadership within the dielectric high-aspect ratio etch space, particularly in NAND. I think that you've seen a tremendous amount of innovation from Lam. What I would just say is that our performance doesn't necessarily drive whether the customer scales faster or doesn't scale faster. That's driven by their own end market needs. What I would point out is what. The key markets within NAND right now, one of them, of course, is QLC.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIf you have a very good Cryo edge process that produces a very vertical high-aspect ratio memory hole, you're more likely to be successful creating a QLC device. I think what Lam does with our customers, and we're engaged so closely with them, is we try to create the technologies that allow them to create the devices that make them successful. When they're successful, then they move quickly. I think that's what we're seeing, not just in Vantex, but in many of the other items. Like I talked about faster read-write speed and the relatively quick adoption we're seeing now of Mali in NAND. A very similar kind of thing, enabling technology.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nOkay. Great. No, great. Maybe SSD. Very worthy. Maybe a quick follow-up question on CSVG. Just to slightly decompose it, upgrades likely up QNQ. Business overall up a little QNQ.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nDo you think that off the June quarter, that Reliant has maybe largely bottomed out or stabilized here, even if you're not necessarily wanting to signal for some recovery in that part of the business?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Brian, I'm not going to get in the habit of decomposing a forward-looking statement on CSVG. It is stronger than we previously thought, though, in total, right? Previously, we've been describing we thought it was going to be flattish. I know we said we think it'd be modestly up. That's good. Upgrades are extremely strong. Service and spares are doing well, and Reliant is down right now. That's kind of how to think about it.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nOkay. Thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Brian.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nDoug, you mentioned the tariff environment is very different in the December quarter versus the September quarter. I was curious if you could unpack that a little. Are you referring specifically to 232, any of the country-specific tariffs? What are you seeing as the most impactful quarter-over-quarter, September, December?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI didn't really say it was—I forget what word you used. There are more tariff headwinds in December than there are in September. That's all we communicated. That's all I was trying to communicate.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nGotcha. On the customers in China, I think Stacy went through it with you guys, but more specifically, going into September, you obviously felt like there would be a falloff, and in a very short window, those customers came back. Is December really a view of conservatism as you expect?\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nIs this a one-time kind of comeback from the China customers, or in Q4, is this more of a conservative outlook, or do you think that you could see customers stepping back in? Obviously, the lead time here seems like it's relatively short to service these guys. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWhen we describe the business, we don't try to be conservative or aggressive. We call it like we see it, and that's exactly what we're doing right now.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. Please go ahead.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Analyst)\nHi, yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I want to double-click on some of your China guidance numbers there. Maybe this is for Doug.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Analyst)\nI think based on your guidance for the next two quarters, it looks like your China—I know we have to back out some of the multinational numbers from your China revenue—looks like domestic China revenue looks like it's tracking flattish year over year. Is that right? The prevailing view for China WFE, this is still a down year. Is it really about outperformance, company idiosyncratic factors, or is that because you did add $5 billion to WFE number forecast for this year? Maybe your view on China WFE is kind of shifting towards maybe this is not really a down year for China WFE. Thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. Boy, you put a lot in there, Charles. I'm not going to get into global multinationals year over year, blah, blah, blah. It was up decently in the current quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe upsided China WFE in total a little bit and then described a view that it's flat to maybe slightly down in the composition of what we're seeing. That's the color we provided. Thanks. Operator, we'll do one more question.\n\n**Operator**\nOf course. Our last question here will come from Timm Schulze-Melander with Rothschild. Please go ahead.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nYeah. Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. I think maybe they're questions for Tim. The first one was on Mali. Impressive that you already have positions in production. Just wanted to ask for some color. Maybe how should we think about your share, or how do you think about your share in Mali? What is that going to look like on maybe a one to three-year view? The second one was on advanced packaging.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nIt was really just to ask about how do you think about the size and the profitability of that opportunity for Lam when you compare hybrid bonding with other 3D packaging technologies? Thank you.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOkay. Great. I'll take the Mali one first. I guess we haven't put out a share projection for Mali, but if you look at where we are right now and where we've been, we've been the leader in ALD metallization in the tungsten space for many, many, many years. In many cases, it's tungsten that is transitioning to Mali, so we would expect to lead in that as well. We're the only company with ALD Mali in production in Foundry Logic. I mentioned a number of places where we're already running in NAND. Those are the two markets that are adopting Mali at this point.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that from a share perspective, at this point, we're doing quite well, and we would expect to continue to do so as we gain more experience. There's a first-mover benefit in any of these markets. You get experience. You build that in. Your next applications and tools are better, and you just kind of keep building on that. It's been our recipe for many, many years. On advanced packaging, what I would say is the only thing we've sized up in the past, we said $1 billion last year. We said bigger this year. We didn't put out a specific advanced packaging number other than to lump it with gate all-around at $3 billion, more than $3 billion total. We're doing well. You think about our position. We have a very strong position in key applications like copper plating, many of the dielectric deposition processes.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAlmost regardless of the advanced packaging scheme, the more complex it is, the bigger our SAM gets. I think you asked about gross margin. We aim for it to be similar gross margins to all of our technology-enabling applications.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nGreat. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, Tim.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThank you. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Operator, that concludes our prepared or our Q&A. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We'll see you later in the quarter, I'm sure.",

Thank you, Ram, and thank you all for joining the call today. Lam's March quarter results reflect continued strong execution across the company, with revenues, gross margin, operating margin, and EPS all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. We delivered a record quarter for foundry revenues, demonstrating our solid product momentum in leading-edge technology inflections. Gross margin percentage was also a record for the company since the Novelis merger, as the investments we have made over the past several years in our manufacturing and supply chain operations are contributing positively as we scale the business. As our guidance indicates, gross margins are set to expand again in the June quarter. On our January earnings call, we laid out what we saw as the fundamental drivers of WFE spending in the year ahead.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nTo date, these have played out largely as expected, with strength in leading-edge foundry logic, technology-driven conversions in NAND, and a focus on high-bandwidth memory and DDR5 and VRAM. From an overall industry perspective, we continue to forecast calendar year 2025 WFE spending in the $100 billion range. We recognize that the current tariff and global economic environment is dynamic, but thus far, we have not seen any meaningful changes to our customers' plans. We are closely monitoring the situation alongside our customers and ecosystem partners. We believe that the agile manufacturing and supply chain capability that we have developed in recent years provides us with the flexibility to lessen the direct impact of tariffs. Our strategic focus in this environment remains on delivering the new products, advanced services, and digital transformation initiatives required to achieve the growth and profitability outperformance goals we described at our investor day in February.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAs a reminder, we identified three key drivers that underpin our ability to outperform overall WFE growth over the next several years. First, we expect to expand our serve market, or SAM, faster than WFE, as deposition and etch intensity rises due to greater semiconductor device complexity. Second, we expect to gain share with the strongest product portfolio in the company's history, targeted at billion-dollar-plus technology inflections such as gate all-around, backside power distribution, advanced packaging, and dry EUV photoresist processing. Third, we expect to grow our CSPG revenue faster than our installed base as customers look to Lam's upgrade, automation, and equipment intelligence offerings to enhance productivity and execution as they expand their global fab operations. Year to date, we are already witnessing incredible momentum in these areas. In deposition, Lam's atomic layer deposition, or ALD, products are making strong gains.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOur Stryker Spark ALD tool delivers the industry's densest conformal low-K carbide dielectric films. Leveraging this capability, we have secured multiple key wins for spacer applications at a leading-edge foundry. Our Altus Halo system enables barrierless atomic layer deposition of molybdenum, reducing the resistance of critical contact and interconnect layers by 50% compared to legacy technologies. In the case of 3D NAND, this reduction is critical to achieving the superior I/O performance needed for AI applications. As a result, Lam's Halo molybdenum process is seeing increased adoption across our leading 3D NAND customers. In etch, our new Aqara system has gotten off to a great start, rapidly solidifying and expanding our market-leading position in conductor etch. Featuring a proprietary industry-first innovation for ultra-fast plasma control, Aqara delivers previously unachievable levels of performance in etch selectivity and profile patterning precision.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe have previously announced leading-edge foundry logic momentum with this tool, and just since our investor day, Aqara has also won multiple critical etch applications at a major DRAM manufacturer. By enabling current DRAM and logic roadmaps with Aqara, we are setting the stage for Lam to make further gains as the industry looks to implement even more challenging device architectures like 3D DRAM and CFET over the next decade. Turning to CSPG, we saw record revenues in our upgrades business. While the growth in upgrades was primarily driven by NAND technology conversions as forecasted at our investor day, key DRAM and foundry logic customers are also more actively upgrading and repurposing existing tools for new applications to optimize capital spending. Looking forward, we see the upgradable architecture of our systems being a growing point of differentiation for Lam.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe are enabling our customers to cost-effectively scale technology on the equipment they already own while creating revenue and share gain opportunities for us. Our collaboration with customers on operating cost optimization extends across the entirety of our installed-based business and over a longer time horizon. For example, in the March quarter, we signed a new multi-year spares agreement with a large memory customer for their latest technology node. This enables us to deliver value to the customer through assured component quality, cost, and availability. Finally, in specialty technologies, we achieved a couple of key milestones recently. First, we displaced a competitor and shipped multiple 200-millimeter PCVD tools for silicon carbide-based wide-band gap power device fabrication. Second, our pulse laser deposition solutions are being extended into more use cases, and we will be shipping our latest tool this year for an advanced memory application.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAs customers look to accelerate R&D and scale manufacturing globally, we're finding new ways to add value. We have talked in the past about our Semiverse Solutions capabilities, which apply advanced modeling, simulation, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to enhance equipment performance and shorten the time required for process optimization. I am pleased to report that recently we signed new licensing agreements with three large customers for our virtual fabrication platform, Simulator 3D. For both its cost and performance benefits, we see virtual fabrication fast becoming a required discipline in advanced technology development, and Lam is leading the industry in this evolution. To wrap up, when I look at our solid March quarter results and strong June quarter guide, I see Lam executing at a high level on all aspects of the outperformance strategy we described at our February investor day.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThis includes new product momentum and key customer wins, value creation from the installed-based business, and innovation in equipment intelligence and virtual process development. Near term, we're taking steps to lessen the direct impact of tariffs and closely monitoring for longer-term indicators of demand changes. Our priority is to continue delivering the technological innovations and world-class support that uniquely enable our customers to scale semiconductor manufacturing faster, more productively, and more cost-effectively. Simply put, our competitive differentiation is enabling our customers' competitive advantage. For this reason, we remain highly confident that Lam is in an excellent position to outperform overall semiconductor industry growth in the years to come. Thank you, and I'll now pass it on to Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nGreat. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Lam is off to a strong start in 2025.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThe March quarter's performance exceeded the midpoint of all of our guidance ranges that we gave on the last earnings call. I was pleased with the company's continued solid execution. We've reached the highest quarterly gross margin percentage since Lam merged with Novelis in 2012. We achieved this by proactively delivering on our operational efficiencies via our manufacturing strategy of being close to our customers. Let's look at the details of our March quarter financial results. Revenue for the March quarter was $4.72 billion, which was an increase of 8% from the prior quarter. Our deferred revenue balance at quarter end was $2 billion, which was essentially flat from the December quarter. Within this number, though, advanced payments trended lower, while other components of the deferred balance trended higher. As we sit here today, I believe our deferred revenue balance will move lower by the end of calendar year 2025.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nFrom a market segment perspective, March quarter systems revenue in memory was 43%, a decrease from 50% in the prior quarter. Within memory, non-volatile memory accounted for 20% of our systems revenue, down from 24% in the prior quarter. Just a reminder, this segment includes a domestic China customer that we classified as a non-volatile memory producer and that we are currently limited from shipping to. On a dollar basis, non-volatile memory growth from non-China-based customers is consistent with our expectations from earlier in the year. The non-volatile memory segment is being driven by customer spending on technology conversions from 1xx layer to 256 layer class devices. We currently expect this segment to represent the biggest percentage growth in systems revenue for Lam in the June quarter. DRAM represented 23% of systems revenue compared with 26% in the December quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nDRAM spending was focused on technology upgrades across one alpha, one beta, and one gamma nodes to enable DDR5, LPDDR5, and high-bandwidth memory. Foundry represented 48% of our systems revenue, up from the percentage concentration in the December quarter of 35%. This level represents a new record in dollar terms for Lam. Shipments for gate all-around nodes and advanced packaging were strong. We also benefited from mature node spending with domestic Chinese customers. I would just like to point out that the last time we were at these revenue levels, back in late 2022, foundry represented a concentration in the low to mid 30% range. We have clearly broadened and diversified our business since then. Finally, logic and other were 9% of our systems revenue in the March quarter, down from the prior quarter's level of 15%. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced leading-edge spending.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nNow I'll discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region accounted for 31%, flat from the prior quarter. Most of our revenue from China continued to come from domestic Chinese customers. Our next largest geographic concentrations were Taiwan and Korea at 24% of revenue each in the March quarter. Taiwan represented a new record level for us in dollar terms. The customer support business group generated approximately $1.7 billion in revenue for the March quarter, down a little bit from the December quarter, however, 21% higher than the same period in 2024. Sequentially, the decline was attributable to lower reliant systems revenue, partly offset by record upgrade revenue. Turning to the gross margin performance, the March quarter came in at 49%, at the high end of our guidance range and improving from the December quarter level of 47.5%.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThe increase reflects a stronger mix, as well as the efficiencies we're delivering from our close-to-customer manufacturing strategy. Operating expenses in March were $763 million, up from the prior quarter level of $735 million. The increase was due to growth in R&D activities associated with our ongoing roadmap differentiation. R&D accounted for 70% of the total operating expenses. Operating margin in the March quarter was 32.8%, above the December quarter level of 30.7%, and near the high end of our guidance range, primarily because of the higher revenue and the stronger gross margin performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.3%, in line with our expectations. Our estimate for the June 2025 quarter is for the tax rate to be in the single-digit range due to an anticipated tax reserve release tied to a statute of limitations expiration.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nBeyond the June quarter, we continue to believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens for the remainder of the calendar year. Other income expense for the March quarter came in at $7 million in expense, compared with $11 million in income in the December quarter. The change in OINE was due to lower gains on our equity investments and lower interest income. OINE will continue to be susceptible to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility each quarter. I do believe OINE will have a slight negative bias in the June quarter. On the capital return side of things, we allocated approximately $347 million to open market share repurchases, and we paid $296 million in dividends in the March quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nAs I indicated on the last earnings call, in the quarter, we retired $500 million of unsecured notes that reached maturity using cash from our balance sheet. We returned 63% of free cash flow in the quarter. This was a little lower than normal due to that cash that we allocated for the debt retirement. For the March quarter, diluted earnings per share came in at $1.04. The diluted share count was roughly 1.29 billion shares, about flat with the December quarter. We have $8.8 billion remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. Let me pivot to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments totaled $5.5 billion at the end of the March quarter, down slightly from $5.7 billion at the end of the December quarter. The primary factors behind the cash decrease were the repayment of those notes, our capital spending, as well as our capital return activities.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nTotal debt on the balance sheet obviously declined by that $500 million to $4.5 billion at quarter end. Day sales outstanding were 62 days in the March quarter, which was a decrease from 69 days in the December quarter. Inventory at March quarter end totaled $4.5 billion, a slight increase from the December quarter, as we prepare for higher revenue levels in the June quarter. Inventory turns were 2.2 times compared with 2.1 times in the previous quarter. We will continue to manage inventory levels to align with customer demand. Our non-cash expenses for the March quarter included approximately $87 million in equity compensation, $83 million in depreciation, and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures in the March quarter were $288 million, up $100 million from the December quarter. A major driver of this increase was a purchase of land in India to enable our planned lab expansions there.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOur capital spending otherwise was focused on lab investments in the United States and global growth in manufacturing. We ended the March quarter with approximately 18,600 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 300 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount growth primarily in the factory and field organizations to support increased tool installation, as well as growing manufacturing activities. We also saw headcount increases within R&D to support that long-term product roadmap. Now let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2025 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $5 billion, plus or minus $300 million. We expect systems revenue in foundry and NAND to be up in the June quarter. This business level is consistent with our expectations from the beginning of the year. I want to specifically point out that we don't see anything being pulled in from future quarters.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe're expecting gross margin of 49.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This guidance includes our current assessment of the direct impacts of tariffs on our business, operating margin of 33.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point, and finally, earnings per share of $1.20, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 1.28 billion shares. This guidance for gross margin and operating margin percentage would represent record levels since our joining of Lam and Novelis. I would also just point out that this would be the highest operating margin percentage that Lam has delivered since the late 1990s. These earnings would obviously represent an all-time record level of profitability. To wrap up, we're off to a strong start in 2025. We're executing well on our critical operational and financial objectives.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWhile the tariff-related macro uncertainty is keeping the environment dynamic, customers are continuing to invest consistently with their planned technology roadmaps. At Lam, we're laser-focused on driving innovation and delivering new product and service capabilities, while at the same time enhancing operational efficiency and managing our profitability goals. We believe we're well set up to outperform overall WFE growth in 2025, as well as in the years ahead. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Our first question today comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah, good afternoon.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nThank you for taking the question. I guess first question was hoping to hit on the NAND upgrade cycle that you're seeing. You talked about that being the biggest growth driver into the June quarter. We'd love to hear your thoughts around the sustainability of that beyond June. Are you anticipating a broadening of spending beyond just the one or two customers that you're seeing in the first half of the year? As you think about the growth there, I guess, how much of that will come through tools versus CSBG upgrades, as well as is there a way to think about your share of wallet with the industry focusing so greatly on upgrades where it would appear that you're going from 30% to maybe 40-50%?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, CJ, this is Tim. I'll go ahead and start on this.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAs we talked a couple of times on earnings calls recently, a significant portion, we said two-thirds of the industry's bits are still at around the 128 level, that the 1XX generation. We see a tremendous number of bits that ultimately have to get upgraded to 2XX plus. We do not know exactly what the rate and pace of that is. Right now, we see a strong move in that direction, and obviously, we are watching for that. Lam is in an incredibly good position on two fronts. One is the fact that we are the ones who upgrade our own tools, and we capture a tremendous amount of the wallet spend associated with upgrading the tools that are in place.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAt the same time, as we described at our investor day, as you extend beyond the 2XX to the 3XX and 4XX layers, you begin to need additional new tooling to enable that stacking. We talked about the sacrificial carbon gap fill that helps enable tier stacking. We talked about the backside deposition tool that helps with wafer stress as you move beyond 200 layers. We talked about the need to change the means of gap fill to an ALD gap fill. These are things that are new tools. I think you're going to see a mix. You're going to see existing tools like our etchers, some of the mold and stack depth tools be upgraded. I think then you'll see new tools being added.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOne of those most significant new tools from a technology perspective is what I talked about in my script, which is the Halo Molly. We are seeing strong momentum there. Eventually, because of the improvement it makes in terms of resistance and that impact on device performance, we think that ultimately broadens out and is adopted across all customers.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. I guess as my follow-up, your Taiwan revenues in the quarter were spectacular, I think the highest level that I can see over the last decade or more. I guess curious on kind of two fronts. One, how sustainable is that contribution to Lam? How does that inform your thinking about what second-half tool shipments could look like versus first half? Thanks so much.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nActually, CJ, let me just start from the standpoint of the comments we have made around leading-edge foundry logic strength.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIt's been our stated strategy for the last several years to invest in new tooling to increase our exposure to leading-edge foundry logic. I don't think it should come as any surprise. When we talk about record foundry revenues, we talk about strength in places like Taiwan. A lot of that is coming because we've been executing on the new product roadmaps. I talked about the Aqara conductor etch tool off to a strong start. We talked about Spark ALD in my prepared remarks. I mean, it goes well beyond that. Obviously, advanced packaging, a big portion of that as well. Lam is really well situated in the technology inflections that are coming in leading-edge foundry logic, and I think that accounts for a lot of the strength. I'll let Doug answer kind of the second part of it.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. I mean, Tim covered it.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIt's sustainable, CJ. It's not going away. It's all about the gate all-around node. It's all about advanced packaging. It's all the stuff we've been talking about. Not much to add from Tim's comments.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nThanks so much.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, CJ. Sure.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Tim, you made a comment on the call that you were, I think you said, \"taking steps to limit the impact of tariffs.\" Can you talk about that? I guess you do have a free trade zone in Fremont, and then when you make the tools in Malaysia, the country of origin is Malaysia. You should be fine there too. You did say taking steps to limit the impact. Can you kind of go into some details on that?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI don't know that I can go into a lot of details as far as the specific steps, but what I can say is that we've worked hard over the last several years to build a very flexible manufacturing supply chain operation that's centered around our U.S. operations, operations in Asia, as Doug said, close to our customers, close to the supply chain. When I say taking steps, it's no different than what we're always doing. We look at the environment, we look at the customers, and then we optimize that capability that we have that exists in many different places in the world to deliver our tools most efficiently and most effectively to our customers. It's kind of what we're always doing. I think that that's a result.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI mean, that flexibility is, again, part of the strategy we executed when we saw disruptions like COVID and other things over past years to really broaden out the global capability of our supply chain and manufacturing operations.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nTim, I'd just remind you, Doug, we've got factories all over the world, right? We've got factories in the United States, factories in Austria, factories in Malaysia, factories in Taiwan, factories in Korea. We've been talking about this for a while. The fact that we have that broad footprint enables us to have some level of flexibility. I guess I'd just leave it there.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nCool. Okay, Doug. I have a question for you. It sounds like NAND upgrades you think should continue.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nIf we look at TSMC's CapEx, it looks like it does kind of flatten off as you get to the back half of the year. I know that you do not track exactly, that your business does not track to their CapEx. I think the feeling was that your revenue bias would be a little bit lower in the back half of the year. Is that still the case? If you can give us some sort of puts and takes into the back half of the year, that would be great. Thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Tim, you are exactly right. You remember exactly what we intimated last call, and that is still the right way to think about it. It is a little bit of a first-half-weighted year.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYou will remember we talked last quarter about the fact that we lost some of those Chinese customers that, as we looked into the year, would have been second-half-weighted. We talked about a number of approximately $700 million of business that we had planned on being there that is no longer there. Thinking about it a little bit first-half-weighted is still the right way to have it, Tim.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay, Doug. Thanks.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Tim.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director and Equity Research)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to follow up on Tim's question. On the reciprocal tariffs that were levied on many countries, including Malaysia and Taiwan, obviously, there is a 90-day reprieve through early July. Let's assume that somehow this does not get resolved or you still have some residual tariffs even post-resolution.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director and Equity Research)\nDoes the Lam team have enough manufacturing capability in the U.S. to service your leading-edge customers that are going to be aggressively building out plants here in the U.S.? I know before your manufacturing consolidation initiative, you did have manufacturing in Oregon and in California, but not sure how that footprint has changed as you brought on your Malaysia factory.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. I would go back to what, it's a good question. I'd go back to Doug's comment about our long-standing strategy of putting our capabilities close to our customers.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYou referred to this as, as we see customers expanding aggressively in the U.S., obviously, that will occur over a period of time in which we've already shown an ability to be agile within our manufacturing and supply chain, like I mentioned, in response to COVID, where we moved things to regions where we could meet our customers' needs more effectively. I think that if we continue to see more investment in the U.S., we still have operations, significant manufacturing capabilities and footprint in the U.S. Obviously, as each region grows, we reassess what local manufacturing we need to support that capability.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nHarlan, Doug, I'd just add we can't instantaneously change things, but given enough lead time, once you know what the rules are, you can adjust certain things with a period of time. Just think about that.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIt might take a little bit of time depending on what shows up, but we have an ability to be flexible.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director and Equity Research)\nGreat. Thank you for that. Good to see the very strong performance in the gross margins. I assume near-term you have spares and subsystems inventories that were there before tariffs were put in place. Just wondering if there are some basic materials that you or your subsystem partners sourced from China, which could potentially be a cost headwind for the team, maybe beyond the June quarter, either on spare parts or subsystem side of the business that could impact product costs if the tariff headwinds remain?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nListen, Harlan, I do not want to get into everything. What do you have where in which country? We have got a global supply chain footprint. We have got a global manufacturing footprint.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe have an ability to respond to different things depending on what the rules are and how they change. I guess I'd just leave it at that.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director and Equity Research)\nOkay. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Harlan.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, it does sound to me like you're, based on your comments, that you still expect China revenues to be in mix to be down in the second half versus the first half. I guess can you just confirm that that is correct? If that is true, does that have any implications for the sustainability of gross margins at these levels given that China's business has tended to have higher gross margins? How do we think about the gross margin sustainability into the back half at these levels given those dynamics?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Stacy, I'm not going to give details in the next quarter by quarter. I still would tell you what we said last quarter was we expect the China concentration year over year to be down. That's still absolutely what we expect. Quarter by quarter, things might bounce around a little bit. I'm not going to give you specific details on the quarter by quarter month. You're right. Gross margin will go up and down depending on customer mix, product mix, overall revenue levels. It's a very complicated calculus when you look at all the things that move it around. There will be variability there.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nI guess so then should I not be thinking about gross margin sustainable at these levels into the back half then? Are you talking about variability around the current level or what?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, there will be variability around the current level, Stacey. It won't go up every quarter. It'll bounce around a little bit.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nOkay. I mean, should I be thinking about it going down? Just to be direct?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. Variability means it'll go up sometimes. It'll go down sometimes.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nOkay. Okay. So my follow-up is very quickly. I think last quarter you said you thought services at CSPG revenues would probably be flat year over year in the calendar year. Is that still your expectation?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, flat is just how I would describe it. Reliant will have some headwinds offset by the tailwinds that the upgrade part of the business has, Stacey. Yeah.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nYeah, I had two questions. One is just to double-check on this overseas manufacturing.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nDoug, can you meet all of your non-U.S. customer demand from your non-U.S. manufacturing sites like Malaysia and Taiwan?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nStacey, I'm not—sorry, Krish. I'm not going to get into the exact details, right? We don't build every single tool at every single factory. With enough lead time, we can adjust depending on what is where. Like I said earlier on the call, depending on what the rules end up being, we can move things around as necessary. Not instantaneously, though.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Got it. Another question on China. Do I understand many of your Chinese customers are probably not—don't have a much long tenure. I'm curious, what is the visibility into China? Because when you look at the last three years, it seemed like China surprised to the upside for WFE and demand.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nDo you think a similar scenario could play out this year, or the calculus is different this time around?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI don't know that it's really all that different. Every customer, Krish, whether they're new or they've been around for decades, communicates plans on what they intend to do, where they intend to go. They all have roadmaps. They all tell you what they want to do. It's no different in a region like China or Korea or Taiwan, frankly.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Got it. Thanks, Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOkay, Krish.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Srini Pajuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you. Question on the foundry logic. I know you get a lot of questions on NAND. It's up 60% sequentially, and I think you're guiding for growth again. First, we all know that advanced logic spending is coming back here.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nIf you could maybe parse it out, to what extent is it just the spending coming back versus you talked about GAA being a driver and backside power being a driver. Also, you talked about share gains in the past. If you could kind of help us understand what's driving that sequential strength and continued strength into June quarter.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. No, we obviously are like talking about the foundry logic story because you just highlighted a couple of really big drivers for us. We talked to them about it as billion-dollar-plus technology inflections. You left out a couple, though. Of course, we talk about gate all-around nodes and how we're really putting a lot of new tools in to support that transition.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nBackside power obviously plays well for an etch and deposition company where you're looking at more metalization interconnect layers going onto the backside and those being thicker and generally requiring more tooling. What you left out was the advanced packaging and the important role that it's playing and the role that Lam has in really a very significant leadership position in steps like TSV etch, copper plating, many of the dielectric deposition films that are required for advanced packaging. That is an area where from both a served market as % of total WFE spending, we've kind of reset the mark for us relative to foundry logic. Advanced packaging is big.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThe one that's still small but coming is progress we're making on dry EUV resist processing, which, when you look out and you think about continued shrinking on the foundry logic roadmap and the challenges with lithography, we think it has a big role to play. We are making progress there both on the DRAM side, which we previously announced at our investor day, but also making progress with advanced customers on the foundry logic side as well. It is just a lot of technology opportunity for a company like Lam.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nYeah, that's helpful. Thanks, Tim. At a high level, Tim, I know you guided for mid-single-digit WFE growth, and you're kind of maintaining that. If I look at your first quarter results and also your second quarter outlook, you're growing north of 20%.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nIs this the level of outperformance that you expect for, I guess, for the rest of the year? I mean, how should we think about if WFE grows 5%? And how should we kind of think about your level of outperformance expectation going forward?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, I don't think we're ready to quantify that number specifically. But we have talked about outperformance of WFE overall. Obviously, the mix and where the spending is occurring, how much of that spending is on those advanced technologies where Lam's served market has stepped up, and we've got new tools going in, that comes into play as well. Overall, I think I finished my prepared remarks with a comment about being highly confident in our ability to outgrow, and I think that's where we'll probably leave it.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks, Tim.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks, Srini.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first question is on WFE. I understand you guys are maintaining the $100 billion range as it's still early and there's no meaningful change in customer plans. One of your North American customers is going through some major restructuring, and we get asked from investors if you guys have baked in kind of a net-neutral spending scenario for the logic customers in an event that customer tends to abandon the foundry plans or change its direction.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nAtif, I guess what I would say, and I won't talk about any one specific customer. I mean, generally speaking, when you guys hear about something, we've known about it well in advance of whatever you're hearing, right? Because they got to tell us what they're doing. If we're going to have people there, we're going to have spare parts there to do installation and whatnot.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYet, to the best of our ability, we've contemplated everything we see in the totality of the market.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nTotally understand. Doug, I have a follow-up for you. In your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that your outlook for June quarter, you do not see any pull-ins from future quarter. I'm just curious, is that common based on the fact that the lead time is super long for your tools, or your customer kind of pipeline kind of has not changed much from what you were seeing 90 days ago? If you could expand on what is that common based on?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nAtif, it's based on plans that we've known these customers have had in place well in advance of even 90 days ago, right?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIf I think back to late last year, the outlook that we had for the current quarter that we just guided has not changed. Frankly, Atif, the whole year hasn't changed. Now, I don't want you to communicate or I don't want to communicate, \"Hey, could something change?\" Of course, anything can change, but we're not seeing anything change in the environment. We're staying very diligent on contemplating, \"Okay, tariffs are out there. Might that have a macro impact? Might the economy get softer?\" Of course, we're aware of those things. Could that negatively impact things at some point? It could. We're not seeing anything, no. I wanted to be very specific about saying that to you guys so you understand. Nothing's changing that we can see.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep. Thanks, Atif.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. For the first one, if all China restrictions are already captured in your March results and June guide, why can't your second-half sales be at or above first-half levels? I guess my real question is, what non-restricted customer or end market could drop in the second half versus the first half?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nVivek, it's just the totality of the market, right? Nothing grows every single quarter. When we look at everything that we see going on relative to customers' plans and timing of things, it's a little bit first-half weighted. It's not one customer or even one or two customers. It's just how the plans of our customers are laying out in total.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. We've talked about it in the past.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI mean, some of these projects are quite lumpy, and there are periods of large shipments, and then we spend a lot of time installing, and the customer ramps those tools, and the next phase of the expansion comes in. I think that is especially true when you talk about upgrades that are occurring in some of these fabs where they may not all be occurring over a very short period of time. They will be spread out, and they might be lumpy in particular quarters.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nI guess what I am trying to ask is, is this second half, right, is that impacted in any way from China restrictions? Because, I mean, you should not be shipping to any restricted customers already. What they do in the second half should not matter. Is it just conservatism about the non-restricted customers or lumpiness in the backup?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nI'm just trying to understand how second half could look like.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nVivek, you're overly focused on China. What we did describe is, \"Hey, if you go back to early December, there were some customers we were shipping to last year that all of a sudden became restricted. The plans those customers had were second-half weighted.\" That kind of went away from what we're looking at. If not for that, right, we were describing a second half that's different in profile than what we see right now. I don't know if we're confusing you or if I'm confusing you with that, Vivek.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nNo, not at all. I just wanted to clarify. For the second one, on the gross margin upside, how much of a benefit, Doug, could you get from just the CSPG being down in terms of mix?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nKind of that being a headwind versus the benefit from perhaps shipping more from Malaysia. Is there a point at which CSPG starts to grow and that becomes a headwind to gross margin? I guess back to the, can gross margin sort of sustain at these levels? What are the positives or negatives? Is it a 50% line of sight for you right now?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nListen, CSPG moving around really does not do a whole lot relative to the road building and gross margin right now. That is not kind of when I go through the reconciliation, anything I am seeing. Frankly, here is an interesting observation I had as I was prepping for earnings. That might be interesting for you guys to think about too.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIf you go back to late 2022, and that was kind of the last time we're at these revenue levels, gross margin was 45%-46%. In our 48%-49%, at that period of time, the overall geographic mix was fairly similar to what we're seeing today. If you think about it, over that timeframe, what's changed? What's changed is our close-to-customer strategy, right? That's uplifted gross margin. Frankly, if you normalize for everything, I don't know, 200 basis points, maybe even a little bit more, it's come from what we've done with the company, frankly. I think Tim and I feel really good about that. That's the strategy we executed. It's benefiting customers too because we're closer, we can turn things more quickly, and frankly, we can do it more affordably.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThat's the big reason over the last several years that gross margin has performed the way it has. That's the most important thing to be thinking about from my point of view.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to ask you, I know I probably already know the answer. You said things hadn't really changed since the tariffs. I'm just kind of curious your conversation with customers. I mean, there's some sense people think, \"Hey, they'll pull in ahead of tariffs.\" The other sense is demand destruction, and maybe they'll rethink their capacity for the second half. Can we walk through what your conversation with Van? I know you said overall nothing changed, but I'm just kind of curious how customers are thinking about this.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nSure.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI'll take a shot at it. Obviously, as I mentioned in my comments, we've been having a lot of conversations with customers to check in for changes. I think over the timeframe, though, in which we've been operating, which is essentially kind of two months or less than two months with this discussion around tariffs, customers really haven't thought about really what they would be looking for for the demand changes. Those are going to occur over a longer period of time. These projects are multi-year investments. They've thought through them. In many cases, they're technology investments to ensure that they have the right products. We spent a lot of time on February investor day talking about the debate around NAND bits and the need.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think we were trying to make the case at that point of independent of end demand, you need a higher quality, more capable bit to compete for the types of applications that are needed in AI. I think you say the same thing on foundry logic. You see the same thing for the investments being made in advanced packaging. Maybe there's a little bit of a disconnect between a true end demand discussion and a technology positioning. A fair bit of the momentum that we're talking about for our business is really coming from engaging customers at the leading edge, where I think strategically they feel they do not have as much of a choice but to continue to invest in those areas to make sure they're as competitive as they can be. I mean, that's a broad statement.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIt may vary customer by customer, but it's how we are engaged with our customers to make sure that however this plays out, they are competitive in their markets, and Lam is positioned with the tools that we've been investing for years to place in those fabs to help them.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director)\nThanks for that. For a second, I just want to ask Doug, in terms of the guidance on the gross margin, is there any impact from tariffs? It's a little bit confusing. There's a minimum tariff. I know we have the 90-day reprieve, but I'm just kind of curious if you've factored in anything.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Blayne, there absolutely is an impact, but it's contemplated based on everything we know and everything we understand, it's contemplated in that guidance of 49.5%. I don't want to communicate there's not an impact. There is absolutely an impact.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director)\nOkay.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director)\nIs there any way to quantify it, or you don't want to go there?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI'm not going to go there.\n\n**Blayne Curtis** (Managing Director)\nOkay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep. You're welcome.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. Is there any way we could think about WFE in terms of a strategic investment versus technology upgrade, which could also be a strategic versus maintenance, and then separately highlighting wafer capacity addition? I'm asking you this question because if you think about all the questions that have been asked, put to you over the past half an hour, it either has to do with China or sensitivity of the $100 billion WFE to macro picture. I'm trying to understand how we could better think about the downside risk, which could be mostly related to wafer capacity add.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nAny color would be great. I have a follow-up.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nSure, Mehdi. I think I acknowledge what you're saying. Most of the questions are coming in this area. If you look at where I focused most of my prepared remarks, it is on Lam's long-term outperformance and even outperformance in this year. That is simply because what really matters from our company perspective in both the short-term and long-term is product alignment to key technology roadmaps of our customers in the industry, how we enable that, how we get those products out. We are only two months removed from our investor day where we described an opportunity to significantly outperform the industry in terms of served market expansion as deposition and etch intensity grows, and also to gain share because we have a unique opportunity to increase our served market faster in some of the key markets like foundry logic.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWhen we look at this year, and I think both Doug and I said, we're pleased with the execution of the company. I think a lot of it, of course, is around the financial performance, but even more so, it's around the seeds we're planting for future outperformance in the latest R&D fabs, the latest strategic investments. I think that's ultimately what is more important to Lam's future regardless of where WFE happens to be in any given year. I like your question, and it's what we tried to address with our scripted remarks.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nSure. Thank you. A follow-up for Doug.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nIf I just take the midpoint of the June quarter guide, it seems to me that the operating drop-through margin of almost 90% is reflecting all the investment of the past couple of years, and now there is limited increasing, limited incremental increase in operating margin, and this is how you're going to scale incremental increase in revenue. Is that the right way to think about sustainability of the margin?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI guess what I'd point out is that we're growing R&D. We're growing R&D because we see these amazingly unique opportunities for us to continue to outperform, right? The intensity of etch and deposition is growing. We're putting our foot on the gas a little bit relative to growing R&D because we see an opportunity to continue to expand the addressable market as well as gain share.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nAbsolutely not apologizing for this because, as I pointed out, this is an all-time record level of operating margin for this company. I think Tim and I feel extraordinarily good about what we're delivering right now, and we want to keep doing that. We are investing to make that happen.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. That captures the incremental drop-through that you're capturing here.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nIt's part of it, yes.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Okay. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Mehdi.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Research Analyst)\nYeah. Thank you. I wonder if I could ask a little bit more on CSPG kind of flat for the year. You said Reliant is a headwind. Can you just give us a sense for the rank order of the subsegments within CSPG? How big is Reliant now?\n\n**Joe Moore** (Research Analyst)\nIs there also a headwind on the service and spares from some of the restrictions in China?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, of course. There are those customers that all of a sudden became restricted. We can no longer provide service and spares. That factors into this too. I mean, what you have going on is we described the point of view that China's down as a % of total year over year. That's the Reliant statement, right? A lot of the tools going in China are Reliant. We have this amazing upgrade business right now that's showing up, especially in NAND, right? Not just NAND, but it's quite strong in NAND. When you think about those two things kind of offsetting each other, overall utilization year over year is stronger. That's beneficial for spares and service. There's a lot of moving pieces in here.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nSpares continues to be the biggest individual component of CSPG, and then upgrades are growing a bunch this year, and Reliant is down.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. The only thing I would add is, again, just like for many years, we were viewed as strong in NAND, and we've certainly made investments to broaden our portfolio quite successfully in foundry logic and DRAM. In the services side as well, we've talked a lot about Reliant. We've talked a lot about upgrades, but you're starting to hear us talk a lot more about intelligence services, equipment intelligence, cobots, the types of capabilities that our customers are going to need, especially as they think about expanding their global manufacturing presence, where there might not be as many people who are skilled at bringing up and ramping an advanced manufacturing fab.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe think things like cobots, equipment intelligence, the use of AI to make sure our engineers are equipped to troubleshoot and repair those tools faster. Those are things that are going to allow us to then perhaps grow our services business to be even a larger portion of that total CSPG. That is a real focus for us.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Research Analyst)\nThat is helpful. Thank you. Within Reliant, that used to be kind of a refurbished tools business, and then for a while, everything was so tight that there were no refurbished tools, so it was all new tools. Is there anything changing in that business? How much of that is kind of new tools, and are you seeing the refurbishment kind of come back into the picture there on Reliant?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nNo, it is still all new tools. There is really not any refurbishment in the industry today. Not really. That is right.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Research Analyst)\nThat's helpful. There's very little.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI mean, this is the, we refer a lot more to specialty technologies as well, which sometimes is the use of these tools for really new applications in those more mature fabs.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Research Analyst)\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Joe.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a broader one. I think you guys said at the end, I'll say that if you look at the upgrades of existing equipment, you thought it was about a $40 billion WFE opportunity. Obviously, if you look at the NAND industry, the backdrop here is that you may have some impacts to consumer spend, etc.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nWhen you look at that handoff, how long do you think that you can continue to grow on the NAND front before you start to get some greenfield kick-in or some new equipment kick-in versus the replacements? Any context around that would be super helpful.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOh boy. That is a little bit of a difficult question. I thought you were going in the direction of how long will it take us to get through that $40 billion of upgrades, which at the end of the day, we did not say all of the, yeah, we gave a range. I think we said it could be anywhere from a few years to more than that.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think, again, some of these things are in-market dependent, and we've talked in the past about the importance of getting the NAND technology up to a point where it can play a significant role in the AI data center and some of the enterprise SSD. That's one of the areas where there is more demand, it seems, and more investment. I think that it's a little too early for us to say, like I say, we're two months beyond that view of $40 billion, and we think it still plays out over the next three, four, five years, over that period of time. I think that we're moving. I think the most important for Lam is it's not just upgrades, but as we talked, it's also a lot of the new tools that are needed to enable those higher layer counts.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThat really, I think, means we see both upgrades, but also really SAM expansion and share gain opportunities as a result of those technology investments.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nMaybe just a tangent off of that question is maybe as demand declines, you'll see increases to capacity coming offline, so more underutilization. In your conversations with customers, is that a linear relationship with how much capacity is taken offline and the desire to do more upgrades, a.k.a. if you see more underutilization from your customers, do you think that they will be more inclined to do more upgrades, or is the amount of upgrades that you're expecting kind of not going to change dependent on utilization?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWe've said that in the past, and I think in most instances, it has been true.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nObviously, in that when customers have the tools offline, that is the most ideal time before they start those back up to perform the upgrades. Obviously, the last NAND down cycle was so severe that I think we saw the tools stay offline longer than we might have expected. I do believe that generally, those things kind of act kind of countercyclical to each other. When you see utilization fall, the next up cycle will usually come up at a different technology node, which means upgrades will have occurred, and Lam will have captured some of that revenue.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Tom. Operator, we're going to take one more questioner.\n\n**Operator**\nThat question will come from Tim Scholes Malander with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Maybe the first one just on CSPG. You've talked about upgrades up, Reliant down.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Equity Research Analyst)\nMaybe you could just give us a little bit of color on the spares, just kind of how that was tracking sequentially, and any color you have on the utilization rates of your fleet, and then have a quick follow-up.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nListen, spares are doing well, right? I mean, Tim, our company grew last year, so the incremental opportunity to sell more spares is up. Utilization is trending favorably, so that drives spares to be doing reasonably well, Tim.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Equity Research Analyst)\nOkay. That's great. Maybe just on the NAND upgrade opportunity, just as you look out maybe over a longer term, maybe one or two years, can you just maybe kind of break that up for us? Just kind of how does that split between upgrade sales and OE sales? Is it pretty equal, or is it skewed one way or the other over the next couple of years? Thank you.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nI think that as time progresses, I think you'll see it become more balanced. I mean, as we said, it's a combination of upgrades to the existing tools that are already there to be able to accomplish higher layer counts. Immediately, you need to also add additional tools to provide the types of technologies that are needed to deliver higher layer counts. Already, it's a mix, but I think as you move forward, and I think one of the previous questions is eventually customers might even start developing new sites as they get better line of sight to stronger demand in the future, then new equipment sales would kick in as well. It's already a mix, and I think it will continue to be a mix kind of for the next several years while we work through that $40 billion upgrade opportunity.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Equity Research Analyst)\nGot it. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Equity Research Analyst)\nOkay. Thanks, Tim. Operator, with that, we're going to complete the call. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and I'm sure we'll see a lot of you guys during the remainder of the quarter.\n\n**Operator**\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment, and we'll review our financial results for the December 2024 quarter and our outlook for the March 2025 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1:00 P.M. Pacific time. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.\n\n**Ram Ganesh** (VP of Investor Relations)\nToday's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the accompanying slides in the presentation. This call is scheduled to last until 3:00 P.M. Pacific time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website, and with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThank you, Ram, and thank you all for joining the call today. Lam closed out 2024 with another solid performance. December quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and EPS were all above our guidance midpoints, reflecting strong and consistent operational execution. Wafer fabrication equipment spending for 2024 finished in line with the mid-$90 billion range we guided earlier in the year. Overall, 2024 was a good year for Lam, even as NAND spending remained at muted levels. System revenues in both DRAM and foundry logic grew to record highs, and the size of our installed base increased to approximately 96,000 chambers. Our results show that we are making good progress on our strategy of broadening Lam's exposure across end-market device segments. It also demonstrates the increasing strength of our product portfolio as semiconductors move into the AI era.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nFor example, gate all-around and advanced packaging technologies are critical enablers for AI device manufacturing, including GPUs and high-bandwidth memory. They are also highly deposition and etch-intensive, and as a result, we saw Lam's shipments for gate all-around nodes and advanced packaging each grow to exceed $1 billion in 2024. In calendar 2025, we see WFE spending rising slightly to approximately $100 billion. Again, we expect technology inflections to lead to faster growth for Lam as AI applications demand greater device and package-level performance. In 2025, Lam shipments to gate all-around nodes and advanced packaging combined should be well over $3 billion. Customer migration towards backside power distribution and dry-resist processing technologies will add further opportunity in the coming year. As we look forward, we view the increasing importance of deposition and etch technology as a differentiator for Lam and an opportunity to outperform.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWith this in mind, we have made strategic investments over the past few years to expand our R&D infrastructure, scale our organization, and transform our innovation process for greater speed. We are now seeing these investments yield important product advances. Our recently introduced Cryo 3.0 technology is winning at the leading edge, delivering best-in-class results for high-aspect-ratio dielectric etch applications on our latest Vantex CX+ product and also helping extend the capabilities of our large flex install base through Cryo upgrades. Our breakthrough dry-resist capability for EUV is enabling patterning of extremely fine features with greater precision, reduced defectivity, higher productivity, and reduced environmental impact. You may have seen that earlier today, we announced that our Aether dry-resist solution has achieved a major milestone, having just been selected as the production tool of record for high-bandwidth DRAM at a leading memory customer.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nTechnology inflections in DRAM and foundry logic, combined with an upgrade-focused NAND environment, create what we believe is a unique setup for Lam to outgrow WFE spending and strengthen our bottom line in calendar 2025. In NAND, the industry is looking to transition the current installed capacity to higher layer counts to achieve better device performance at lower bit cost. Here, several trends play to our favor. One is the transition from molybdenum or MoL. Lam's patented multi-station sequential deposition technology allows us to employ a differentiated liner and fill process sequence that is proving to be a winner with customers. The momentum for our new MoL product is strong. A second trend is the adoption of carbon gap fill to enable higher bit density and lower cost through multi-tier stacking. Our innovative PECVD-based pure carbon gap fill process provides high-edge selectivity, superior mechanical properties, and simplified dry process removability.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWhile we are in the early innings of these transitions and early in the industry upgrade cycle overall, we expect adoption of molybdenum and carbon gap fill to drive several hundred million dollars in NAND shipments for Lam in calendar 2025. Lam's opportunity will grow even further in future years as more of the million-plus wafer starts per month installed capacity converts to higher layer counts. The differentiation we are delivering for customers runs deeper than the process technology itself. Our Semiverse Solutions capabilities apply advanced modeling, simulation, data science, analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to further enhance our equipment performance and reduce the time needed for process optimization. This is strengthening our competitiveness, and most recently, we used our Semiverse Solutions capabilities to successfully defend a key dielectric etch application at a major memory manufacturer.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nFurthermore, we are leveraging these capabilities to help address the semiconductor industry's global workforce shortage. Through collaborations with universities in the United States, India, and Korea, Semiverse Solutions software is already being used to educate the next generation of semiconductor industry innovators. Our goal is to provide access to Lam's semiconductor simulation technology to tens of thousands of aspiring engineering students through the rest of the decade. In CSBG, our equipment intelligence and in-fab service automation solutions are seeing significant traction with customers. Last month, we announced the industry's first collaborative maintenance robot. Since then, we have shipped our Dextro cobot to a third major memory manufacturer, and it is being installed in their fab as part of a multi-year services agreement.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOver the next decade, the semiconductor industry is expected to witness a strong expansion of fab capacity globally, and our Cobot technology offers an important and cost-effective solution to enable precise and repeatable maintenance beyond what human workers alone can achieve. Lastly, our strategic investments in scaling our operations are paying off. Our Asia operations continue to ramp very efficiently and in 2024 help drive meaningful improvement in both our responsiveness to rising customer demand and our gross margin. Doug will provide some additional detail in his prepared remarks, but as a headline, I am pleased we delivered in calendar 2024 approximately 160 basis points of operating margin expansion, even as we invested heavily in new products and infrastructure to fuel future growth, so to wrap up, Lam is in a strong position as we enter the new year.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nDeposition and etch are becoming increasingly vital to semiconductor manufacturing, and we have made key investments to strengthen Lam's product portfolio. I look forward to sharing more on this at our upcoming investor day. Thank you, and I'll now pass it on to Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nGreat. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. We delivered strong financial results in calendar year 2024 with revenue of $16.2 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.36. We're obviously pleased with the company's continued strong execution. For calendar year 2024, CSBG revenue increased 11% to $6.6 billion, exceeding our expectations. Gross margin came in at 48.2%, which was the highest annual result since Lam merged with Novellus in 2012. Let's look at the details of our December quarter financial results. Our revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of our guided range. Revenue for the December quarter was $4.38 billion, which was an increase of 5% from the prior quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOur deferred revenue balance at quarter end was $2 billion, essentially flat with the September quarter. I do believe our deferred revenue balance will trend lower into calendar year 2025, but will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter. From a market segment perspective, December quarter systems revenue in memory was 50%, up from 35% in the prior quarter. Within memory, non-volatile memory increased coming in at 24% of our systems revenue, up from 11% in the prior quarter. This market segment has reached the high point since the end of 2022, driven by NAND spending on tech conversions from 1XX layer class devices to 256 layer. We expect these conversions to continue in calendar year 2025. DRAM represented 26% of systems revenue compared with 24% in the September quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nDRAM spending was focused on tech upgrades to the 1-alpha, 1-beta, and some initial ramp of 1-gamma nodes to enable DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory. HBM investments in our tools enabling through-silicon via capability continues to be strong. Foundry represented 35% of our systems revenue, a decrease from the percentage concentration in the September quarter of 41%. Growth for gate-all-around node spending partially offset the decline in mature node spending. The logic in other market segment was 15% of our systems revenue in the December quarter, down from the prior quarter level of 24%. The decrease was driven by reduced spending in both leading edge as well as specialty technology nodes. Now I'll discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region accounted for 31%, which was down from 37% in the prior quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nMost of our China revenue continued to come from domestic Chinese customers. The next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 25% revenue in the December quarter, an increase compared with the September quarter level of 18%. And finally, Taiwan and the United States rounded out the remainder of the top four regions. The customer support business group generated almost $1.8 billion in revenue for the December quarter, consistent with the September quarter and 20% higher than the same period in 2023. Sequentially, growth in upgrade revenue largely offset the decline that we saw in Reliant systems. While spares and the Reliant product line continue to be the two largest components of CSBG revenue generation, we achieved record upgrade revenue, demonstrating the strength of that growing installed base.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nTurning to gross margin performance, the December quarter came in at 47.5%, which was above the midpoint of our guided range, but was down from the September quarter level of 48.2%. This was primarily a result of unfavorable customer mix, which we foreshadowed in the last earnings call. We've improved elements of our cost structure during the past two years and expanded the gross margin contribution from our Asia operation strategies by a little more than 100 basis points as we exited calendar year 2024. We expect incremental benefit to gross margins as we continue to scale production on a go-forward basis from this strategy. Operating expenses for December were in line with our expectations at $735 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $722 million. The increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation tied to the company's increased profitability. R&D accounted for 67% of total operating expenses.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOperating margin in the current quarter was 30.7%, a little bit below the September quarter level of 30.9% and near the high end of our guidance range, primarily because of that higher revenue and the stronger gross margin performance, and I just reiterate what Tim mentioned, that we delivered a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin for calendar year 2024. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%, within range of our expectations. Our estimate for the March 2025 quarter is for the tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens range. Other income and expense for the December quarter came in at $11 million in income compared with $13 million in income in September quarter. The slight fluctuation in OINE was due to lower interest income, which was somewhat offset by lower foreign exchange losses and a little bit of gain in equity investments.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOINE will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility quarter to quarter, and as we sit here today, I do believe OINE will have a slight negative bias in the March quarter. On the capital return side of things, we allocated approximately $650 million to open market share repurchases, and we paid $298 million in dividends in the December quarter. For the 2024 calendar year, we returned 98% of free cash flow, totaling $4 billion, which was at the high end of our long-term capital return plans of 75%-100% of free cash flow. For the December quarter, diluted earnings per share came in at $0.91. The diluted share count was roughly 1.29 billion shares, which was a reduction from the September quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nDuring 2024, we repurchased nearly 34 million shares through our share buyback program, and we have $9.2 billion remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase plan. Let me pivot to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments totaled $5.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, down from $6.1 billion at the end of the September quarter. The main driver of the cash decrease was obviously our capital return activity. The sales outstanding was 69 days in the December quarter, an increase from 64 days in the September quarter. Inventory at the December quarter end totaled $4.4 billion, a slight increase from the September quarter as we prepare for higher revenues in the March 2025 quarter. Inventory turns were 2.1 times flat from the prior quarter level. We will continue to manage inventory levels to the best of our ability to align with customer demand.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe're pleased to announce that we upsized our revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Additionally, I just mentioned that we have $500 million of unsecured notes maturing in March this year, which we intend to simply pay off using cash on the balance sheet. We may choose to refinance this notional amount in the future as we continue to monitor the interest rate environment. By bolstering our liquidity with the credit facility, we've created some optionality and flexibility here. Non-cash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $82 million for equity compensation, $83 million in depreciation, and $13 million in amortization. Capital expenditures in the December quarter were $188 million, up $78 million from the September quarter. Spending was mainly centered on lab-related investments in the United States and Asia and manufacturing facilities, supporting our global strategy to be close to customers' development and manufacturing locations.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe ended the December quarter with approximately 18,300 regular full-time employees, which is an increase of approximately 600 people from the prior quarter. Growth was predominantly in field and factory roles to support increased tool installation as well as growing manufacturing activities. Now let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2025 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.65 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 48%, plus or minus one percentage point. We anticipate roughly consistent levels of customer concentration. Operating margin of 32%, plus or minus one percentage point. This guidance accounts for the normal seasonal increase in operating expenses that we always see at the beginning of the calendar year. And finally, earnings per share of $1, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 1.29 billion shares.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI would mention that as we look into 2025, we plan to continue to deliver incremental leverage to the bottom line. At the same time, we will be growing R&D and continuing to grow investment in a digital transformation project that we initially launched in 2023. Each of these investments is expected to enable future financial benefits to the P&L that we plan to show you in February. So let me wrap up. We executed well in calendar year 2024. We delivered 11% growth in CSBG and 160 basis points improvement in operating margin, both of which exceeded our expectations from the beginning of last year. We've made key investments in our product portfolio to drive serviceable addressable market and share opportunity, and we've grown the global infrastructure to collaborate and deliver innovative solutions for our customers. We also grew spending in that digital transformation program.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe look forward to sharing more details on the strength of our product portfolio, as well as an updated long-term financial model at our Investor Day in New York City on February 19th. We hope to see you there. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.\n\n**Operator**\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Our first question today is from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Doug, can you speak about the gross margin? The guidance is pretty good. And you talked about Malaysia now is turning to a tailwind, and I know that the China mix has basically reset. So how to think about the puts and takes for gross margin as you move March and through the rest of the year?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Tim, I think we're going to be a pretty tight range, kind of where we've been the last quarter, plus or minus a little bit. And the puts and takes, as you know, because we've talked about this in the past, you're going to continue to see some headwinds from customer concentration. I think there's more headwind as we go through the year, most likely offset to a certain extent by that Asia operation strategy. So those are the things to think about. I wouldn't run away from where we are right now, though. In fact, maybe trim it just a little tiny bit as we go through the year.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. And then can you give any color? I know you're saying that WFE is going to be up maybe $3-$5 billion year over year. But can you provide any color by end market? I know, and I've asked you this before, but one of your peers is talking about NAND basically doubling this year. So can you give any color there? And do you think that it is possible that it doubles this year? Thanks. Yeah, Tim, maybe I'll unpack it just a little bit of color. We're not going to give specific details, but NAND will be up this year. I don't know that it's going to double necessarily.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nUnderstand also, though, that NAND spending, there will be a little bit of NAND spending that will occur in China with a customer we can't sell to. So that may be a little different from the peer you're asking about. I think leading edge boundary is going to be pretty strong this year. I think that's pretty well understood, and DRAM will be plus or minus coming off a very strong year last year. I think it'll continue to be pretty strong this year.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you, Doug. Yep.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Tim.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one, Doug, I had for you was kind of A on China. What is kind of your visibility in terms of lead times? Also, can you help us quantify the impact of these recent China export controls for Lam in calendar 2025? And then I'll follow up.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Krish, our lead times really haven't changed too much. And I know you're asking specific to China, but China is no different than the rest of the world. Geographically, lead times are pretty much the same. And yeah, obviously, in early December, there were some new regulations that came out restricting a handful of customers. That certainly impacted us. The forecast we had from that group of customers was probably, oh, I don't know, $700 million or so. That obviously we won't be able to ship to those customers. And that revenue footprint, when we were looking at the forecast originally, would have been a little bit second-half weighted in 2025. So that's a way to think about it. I don't know that that's all that different than what you've heard from our peers, Krish.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. That's very helpful for quantifying that, Doug. And then just a quick follow-up. You spoke about your WFE growing maybe 4%-5% this year on a year-over-year basis. How to think about the split between Systems and CSBG in March and how that evolves through the rest of the year?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, I'm not going to get into the detail of kind of how much is CSBG and how much is Systems. I would tell you that there's some headwinds in CSBG related to the Reliant grouping, right? I think that's pretty well understood. There's not a huge amount of spending in mature node outside of China. And then within China, we've got a handful of customers that, like I said, are now restricted. Offset, though, it's going to be a strong year for upgrades. And we've been talking about that, right? We believe NAND spending is going to be largely upgrade-related, and that's going to benefit the upgrade product line within CSBG.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thanks a lot, Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. Thanks, Chris.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess to maybe piggyback on that question, could you speak to, if you had to rank order by product or upgrade or whatnot, how we should be thinking about what are the biggest kind of incremental drivers for you? I think you talked about gate-all-around and advanced packaging growing an incremental $1 billion in calendar 2025. Could you kind of add to that in terms of NAND upgrades, molybdenum?Anything else that is relevant that we should be thinking about in 2025?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah, C.J., let me start with that one. I think that from the perspective of kind of the most impactful change year on year, I think for us, it's NAND. It's NAND starting to come back and, again, the very strong position we have within every dollar spent on a NAND upgrade. And that's kind of across the board, the edge tools and such that need to be upgraded. But at the same time, on the last call, I mentioned this point that about two-thirds of the bits are still being manufactured on nodes below 200 layers. And what happens as you move above 200 layers is not only do you have to upgrade the existing tools, but you have to start adding additional tools to deal with the complexity of that transition.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThat's where we talk about the new carbon gap fill tool, which is key to multi-tier stacking, which you start to see in the 200- and 300-layer generations. As you get to 300 layers and beyond, you start seeing new tools get added like molybdenum for that transition. It depends on which customer and exactly which transitions they're switching to. NAND, from both an upgrade and new tool shipment, is probably our largest year-on-year difference. There's no doubt that our strong position in advanced packaging and the strength that Doug alluded to within leading-edge foundry and what that means for advanced packaging continues to show growth there. I feel like, as I said, there's a nice setup here where many of the areas we've been investing in really are starting to come together this year.\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nThat is very helpful. I guess as a follow-up, and Doug, I'm not sure you're going to want to answer this, but if I were to annualize implied shipments for March, that would suggest pretty meaningful top-line growth year on year relative to the WFE growth that you outlined. So should we be thinking about revenues lower in the second half, or are you really highlighting tremendous outperformance in 2025?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, I don't know, C.J. You know I'm not going to answer that question. So you kind of answered your own question. I'm going to get into giving you quarter-by-quarter guidance. Listen, WFE is going to grow a little bit. We're going to outperform WFE. We're confident about making those statements. We've been making it for a little bit of time now. The rest of it will depend on profile of spending and so forth.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI don't know if you just annualize March, if that's the right way to look at it. Like I said, we're going to guide one quarter at a time. I don't know. You got to do a little of your own pencil work. Don't lose sight of what I did say, though, about the second-half weighting of some of that China customer that all of a sudden we can't ship to any longer. That would have been a little bit second-half weighted. So comprehend that as you build your model for the year.\n\n**C.J. Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, C.J.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On advanced packaging and high bandwidth memory, I know you guys started last year with the view that your advanced packaging business would do about $700-$800 million in revenues on the April earnings call. You upped that to $1 billion, and then that number was further upped to over $1 billion. Can you guys just true us up? What was the actual revenue you drove in calendar 2024 on advanced packaging?\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nAnd then with bit demand growth for HBM targeted to grow 50%-70% per year over the next couple of years, the move from 8 high to 12 high, you've got the move in advanced packaging from 2.5D to 3D SOIC. How should we think about your advanced packaging/HBM growth profile for this year? And in general, over the next few years, sort of how do we think about the mid to longer-term growth profile?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Harlan, maybe I'll chime in and then let Tim add on. Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to give you a precise number, but in 2024, we finished above $1 billion. I don't think that surprises you. And I'm not going to give you a precise number for this year, but it is certainly going to grow again in 2025. And it's being driven by all those things you talked about, right? HBM 3 going to 3E, to potentially going to 4 at the end of the year, 8 going to 12, going to 16 die. We do all that TSV. So we're set up to do really well. We're pretty excited about it. I don't know, Tim, you want to?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. No, I think, Carla, the only thing I'd add is that we've been saying for a while that, and I think you've been hearing it in the marketplace, advanced packaging and getting the yield and productivity right on these processes isn't easy. And so this is where Lam, as a critical process supplier with expertise in things like copper plating and etching, we're delivering value there. So we feel very good about our positions. And we're going to continue to grow with that market and do very well. So we can't put an exact number on it, but again, we did indicate we will grow again this year. And I think that's about all we can say.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nThat's helpful. And then for Doug, this is the third, fourth consecutive quarter where your gross margins are coming in better than expected. Continued strength on the guidance for the March quarter, right?\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nThe overall sustainability and growth of your gross margins has been very, very solid. I've actually been surprised at how rapidly you've ramped your Malaysia manufacturing facility. Low-cost geography. You've got strategically aligned supplier base in this region. At the same time, you guys have also, I think, consolidated a significant part of the higher-cost manufacturing base. So is it fair to assume that on incremental revenue growth going forward, most of this is flowing through Malaysia? And so better incremental gross margin flow through and maybe any way to help us kind of quantify that?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, I'm not going to quantify it. I mean, I just gave you a number, right, that we've delivered over 100 basis points from the strategy already. There's a little bit more to go for sure. Don't lose sight of the fact, though, that we're going to have the headwind from customer mix.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nWe've been talking about it for a while. So I'm trying to telegraph that to you as well. I guess, yeah, listen, we're pretty pleased with our performance on gross margin. Frankly, this was all done by us, right? This was a proactive strategy. Things turned down in early 2023. We jumped on the horse and started riding down the trail. And frankly, the guys and gals in our global operations organization have done a phenomenal job here, right? So super happy with what's going on. We're going to keep driving this. But don't run away with it too much right now because, like I said, we've got that customer concentration headwind that we got to deal with here.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah.bAnd Harlan, the only thing I would add is that I think that you should take away from this that Lam is committed to make investments to see a sustainable step up in performance. And that's what we did. Doug, for many quarters, was talking about how Malaysia was a headwind. That investment we were making as we ramped it, it wasn't yet up and going. And now you're seeing a little bit of the same thing with the investment we keep talking about with digital transformation. There's going to be a period here where we're investing. But long term, we have a view that this company and the semiconductor industry in general are going to be bigger. And we want to have fundamental improvements in our operations and in our cost structure. And so I think Malaysia is a great sign of what we've done.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAnd I think the digital transformation is something that's still yet to come. And it just shows that we have a very long-term commitment to improving the financials of this company.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director of Equity Research)\nYeah. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Harlan.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Senior Analyst)\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two as well. The first one, the outperformance relative to WFE you guys expect to deliver this year, is that mostly a function of Dep and Etch growing as a percentage of the overall WFE market, or is it that plus you guys' winning share within Dep and Etch? And if it's both, on the latter, which applications do you guys have the highest expectations from a market share gains perspective?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWell, it is both. But as we've described in the past, that often the way we look at market share gains is the wins of new applications, some of which didn't exist before. And so it's not always a head-to-head fight that results in one winner for an application. I gave an example of that with the carbon gap fill, new application that gets created simply because of the growing complexity of tier stacking in NAND. Ultimately, that results in share gain as measured by our share of our SAM and also our share of the market itself. So there are a number of those. I think there are pure market share wins. We talked about, obviously, our Aether announcement today, where that win is created through SAM expansion, where we move into markets where we previously haven't competed before and do become the tool of record based on superior technology and product performance.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nIt's hard. It really is a makeup of many different things as to why we think we outperform, but it's really driven by what you said at the beginning. Etch and deposition are becoming incredibly more important to the building of these complex structures, whether it's gate-all-around, it's the advanced packaging 3D structures, it's the new architectures in DRAM, it's the multi-tier stacking in NAND. All of those are accomplished through new, very complex etch and deposition processes that Lam is leading in.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Senior Analyst)\nGot it. That's great. Thank you. Then for CSBG, maybe for Doug, I know you're not going to guide the full year. The spares part of the business, upgrade part of the business, historically, it's been obviously correlated with your chamber account, which continues to grow. Is there a way to think about Reliant in 2025 on a year-over-year basis?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Reliant is probably going to be down year-over-year. Toshi, as I think about puts and takes, and I don't think that's surprising, right? If you look at what's going on in specialty node investment, mature node investment in areas like analog, microcontrollers, there's not a lot of spending occurring outside of China. And then I think China WFE is going to be softer year-over-year, 2024 to 2025, and we lost a handful of customers as well. So that'll contribute to all of that there relative to Reliant. Offsetting that, though, I think it's going to be a good upgrade year, right? We've been talking about that. Such that right now, if I was giving you a little bit of color to think about CSBG, we're probably flat-ish, again, plus or minus. And we'll keep giving you updates as we go through the year as things change.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. And Toshi, the only thing I'd add on CSBG is, obviously, we recognize that each of the different components of CSBG sort of move around. So maybe it's helpful to think about the areas that ultimately are long-term future growers. And the one we've highlighted recently, and I talked about today, is how you use equipment intelligence and cobots and other things to disrupt the way in which service is done inside the fab and therefore capture some of that value while still delivering a lot of productivity to the customer. And so I think that's an area that still is less tapped, I would say, than our spares and upgrades and Reliant business that we talked about so much. And so there's still a lot of opportunity to come there as we start to roll out these new products onto new platforms and into fabs.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Senior Analyst)\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThank you, Toshi.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you. Doug, I just want to clarify the previous answer you gave on CSBG. So when you say flat-ish, are we talking calendar 2024 being flat-ish, or is that fiscal? I'm sorry, calendar 2025 being flat-ish, or is it fiscal, or are you talking sequentially for the next few quarters, I guess?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nCalendar 2025. I never talk about fiscal years. Almost never. It's year-over-year. You should think of CSBG in total as flat-ish.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you for that. And then my question, maybe for Tim, is on memory. I know you said several hundred million dollars of contribution. I'm just trying to reconcile what we are hearing from your customers, Tim. Obviously, demand is not great, and the utilization levels are lower, and some customers are actually lowering their factory loadings. So maybe you can help us. How broad-based of a transition are you seeing? Is it like a handful of customers? I know there are only a handful of customers, but just if you could give us some additional color as to how you feel about the sustainability of Mali B as we go through the year, that'll be helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. I think it's the sustainability. I mean, we've talked about the fact that, like I mentioned in the last call, the large number of the industry bits. We said two-thirds of the bits still being manufactured under 200 layers. Those are all nodes. Those are all bits being manufactured without Mali. And so over time, and we've said this is a multi-year transition, as you start to move this million-plus wafer starts per month capacity that exists towards higher layer counts.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nNow, different customers have different intercept points as to when moly comes in, whether it's at exactly what layer count. I can't go into that detail customer by customer. But what it says is we're going to see moly coming in as each customer reaches that transition point. Now, how do we reconcile the fact that customers are spending to go to higher layer counts and introduce new technologies like moly and carbon gap fill with their statements as well that they might be wanting to cut spending? Well, first of all, I mean, upgrades are a very efficient way to move forward the technology. And so that's a reduced WFE means by which to get bits to higher layer counts. And frankly, higher layer counts result in lower bit costs for manufacturing and higher performance. And for certain end applications, you need higher performance to meet those requirements.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nAnd so I think that this is not a very broad and large upgrade move, but it's the early signs, and that's why we're starting to see improvement in our numbers. But over the next several years, you'll continue to see Mali contribute more and more as the number of wafers at those higher layer counts continues to increase.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Rene.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. Doug, just one or two clarifications. Why will CSBG be flat this year? And then how should we think about OpEx growth in calendar 2025?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Vivek, it's what I described. We're coming off a pretty strong year for the Reliant product line. That's probably going to be less strong next year. Offsetting that, I believe, will be the spending on upgrades. Kind of based on what Tim just told you, right? There's an aging set of equipment in NAND. There's upgrades other places too. So that's the up and the down, I guess, is the way to think about it. Does that make sense?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nYep. And the OpEx growth, Doug?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nListen, we're going to increase spending this year, right? I talked about we're growing R&D. We're investing in a digital transformation project that's going to deliver future financial benefit. But also listen to what I said in the scripted remarks. We plan to deliver some amount of leverage this year too, right? We're going to deliver leverage to the P&L. So revenue should grow faster than OpEx is the way to think about it.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nSo last year, Doug, just so OpEx was up mid-teen, should we assume a similar kind of OpEx growth given the digital transformation projects, or would it be very different from that run rate?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Vivek, I'm going to guide you one quarter at a time. You'll get a little bit of leverage from us this year. So that's as much as I'm going to give you right now.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Semiconductor, Semiconductor Equipment, and Hardware or Networking Equipment analyst)\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. First, a quick clarification that $100 billion WFE number is unrestricted WFE, meaning it includes your expectations, what your indigenous competitors are going to earn in sales as well. That's the first question.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nAtif, it's all in. It's everything, right? There were restricted customers in 2024. There's restricted customers in 2025.bWe're describing it all into the best of our ability.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Semiconductor, Semiconductor Equipment, and Hardware or Networking Equipment analyst)\nOkay. And then, Doug, you made a comment that you're expecting similar customer concentration in the March quarter. And I was wondering if you're expecting similar regional concentration as well. And just trying to see if China's sales are going to come down again in the March quarter after the drop in the December quarter.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYou got to listen to my euphemisms when I describe stuff. Customer concentration actually is pretty tied to geographic concentration when I talk about it right now. So you should expect that to be roughly consistent December to March, roughly. I do believe that, again, we said this on the last call, again, China concentration for a year will be down versus 2024 in 2025.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Semiconductor, Semiconductor Equipment, and Hardware or Networking Equipment analyst)\nGot it. Makes sense? Yep. Okay.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, hon.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Doug, I don't mean to harp on it, but I want to go back to the CSBG outlook flat. So just on a run rate basis, you'd be down like $100 million a quarter versus where you ran in December. And I'm just confused given the NAND strength that's upgrade-driven, presumably a lot of that would be CSNG. So I wasn't aware that, I mean, Reliant must be falling by a huge amount year over year for me to just fit that outlook. I mean, I'm just trying to what am I getting wrong? Or is there just some conservatism built in there? Or why such a small fallout given strength in NAND?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nNo, no, no. No, there's not conservatism. Reliant is going to be down, right? We just lost a bunch of customers in China that largely purchase Reliant systems. So that's part of what's going on too.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nOkay. So that was the set. Did you have $700 million in calendar 2024 in CSBG for Reliant in China that goes away in 2025? Was it that big?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nStacy, $700 million was our forecasted revenue for that set of customers, what they would have spent in 2025 that now they're not spending. And a lot of that would have been Reliant, Stacy.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nOkay. Okay. All right. I guess maybe along those lines, again, to go back to the China mix, I mean, you said customer mix. It sounds like the customer mix headwinds increase as we go through the year. Did I get that right? And if that's true, again, does that imply that China percentage ought to be going down as we go into the second half?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI said the China revenue percentage should be down in 2025 versus 2024.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nI'm talking about versus the current run rate because you talked about the customer headwinds sort of increasing. And it sounds like the rest of the business will grow when you're missing China revenue in the back half. So does that percentage go down in the back half versus where you're running now? Sounds like that's what you're saying.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. Listen, I'm not going to guide more than one quarter at a time because stuff changes. Year over year, Stacy, though, it's going to go down.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Senior Analyst)\nGot it. All right, guys. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOkay. Thanks. Yep.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Semiconductor Industry Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you. In terms of NAND being the strongest growth business, can you kind of characterize where we are from a NAND WFE basis? And I guess it's a little surprising because we're seeing these utilization cuts and things like that. And I know you'd alluded to technology transitions, but just maybe a little bit more color on why NAND is strong at a time when the economics of NAND seem to be softening.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Well, I think that, one, we would characterize the NAND spending today very much as technology migration. And so I think that, as I said, comes into play for different reasons. One is it does help reduce bit cost and also improve device performance. And so there are customers that are looking to make some changes there on certain lines they have.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nNow, when we talk about the growth, we haven't obviously given a number for what NAND WFE will be in 2025, but it's coming off of, as you know, a very low base. And if primarily all of the spending this year is on upgrades, again, the strength in Lam's, we spoke specifically about that being a strong grower for Lam, our strongest growing segment, then we would say that that is because of our very high capture rate of WFE spent on upgrades. And so I can't speak to every customer and what they're going to be spending this year, but all we can say is that there is still a strong desire to move certain lines forward to higher levels of technology, and that's what we're seeing.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Semiconductor Industry Analyst)\nThat's very helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Joe.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nYeah. Hi. Just a quick question on the NAND side. Sorry if somebody asked this question already at joint late. Nice rebound there, but as you look at the full year, given how much NAND has come down, any thoughts on how much you see NAND growing this year in 2025?\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nCalendar 2025. We're not going to give you a number, Vijay. It's going to be up, though.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. Got it. Okay. And then on the, can you talk to what you're seeing on the cryo etch side? I think you guys have talked about an opportunity with QLC NAND. How do you see that for 2025, I guess?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we had a release late last year on what we call our Cryo 3.0 technology, which really is a breakthrough in terms of performance for being able to etch very deep, very vertical holes for NAND flash memory, and also, that same technology can be used for other devices like DRAM that also need a high-aspect-ratio dielectric etch, and so we're very happy with the progress that's been made. What makes it very attractive is that our Cryo technology can also not only be sold on new tools going forward, but also used to upgrade existing systems we have in the installed base, which is very attractive for our customers financially.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Joe Quattrocci with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Thanks for taking the questions. For the December quarter, the strength that you saw in NAND revenue, just wanted to clarify, was there anything in there from the Chinese customer that you can no longer ship to? I just want to kind of understand that the strength that you saw is really the core NAND customer upgrades.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nNo, there's nothing from a Chinese NAND, indigenous Chinese NAND customer. Nothing.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nOkay. Helpful. As a follow-up, as we just think about the two-thirds of NAND capacity below 200 layers, I mean, how should we think about that trajectory exiting this calendar year in terms of that change of mix?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nWell, I think that's the question that we've been hearing quite a number of times on the call, which is, can we predict the rate and pace? And I think you have to look. The one thing we're certain of is over time, more and more of that installed base will continue to be upgraded to higher levels of technology. Yeah, I think you have to look at the state of the NAND market, the requirements of each individual end application, and what device requirements it holds, and that'll tell us a little bit more about the rate and pace, but at this point, we can't really detail that in any way for you right now.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Semiconductor Industry Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep. Yep. Thanks, Joe.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question is from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nHey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Doug, I'll test you with one more NAND one. Forgive me. I know you've gotten a lot here.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nSo, in terms of the upgrades really coming in strong, I think it's actually very impressive that you're able to guide CSBG kind of flattish for the year. Just, I was under the assumption that Reliant was a bigger portion of that mix of the bucket. So to totally offset that is surprising, and I guess very good. But when I look back at the last three years with where NAND spend has been kind of in the high single-digit billions, I think people give or take that. But you've seen the market struggle, and you really haven't seen this takeoff in terms of spend. What's driving this above 200 layer upgrade this year? I guess I'm asking the question a bit differently. Why the urgency? Just because the numbers you're describing for this next year need to be pretty robust. Just want to understand why that's happening so quickly.\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nIt's obviously a really good thing for you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah, Tom, I guess it's really what Tim described. The technology that's out there, two-thirds of it is sub 200 layer. It needs to get upgraded. Listen, it's not like we're back to the races at peak NAND spending. It's nowhere close to that. But you got enterprise SSDs evolving to need QLC, which needs the capability of structures that are beyond 200 layer, right? You got to get the circuit under the array. You need to have wafer bonding capability. And these technologies that are sub 200 layer don't enable that. That's what's going on. In addition to what Tim mentioned earlier, right, when you upgrade, you get a lower cost per bit. And so there's still economics that make sense there to a certain extent. And that's largely what we see going on this year.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nI don't know, Tim, if you'd add anything.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nNo, no. I think that's right.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThat makes sense, Tom?\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nIt does.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOkay. Do you have a follow-up, Tom?\n\n**Tom O'Malley** (Equity Research Director)\nYeah. I guess I'll pivot over to the foundry logic side. Obviously, a smaller percentage of the business view. We haven't really focused on it much this call. You're kind of pointing to the NAND business being a leader in your growth outlook for this coming year. But just given the CapEx guide that we saw from TSMC, any view of the change in market share dynamics and how that may impact you in the next year? Obviously, the view is that some of the other leaders are losing out to TSMC. How does that impact you? You've been asked this question previously, but I wanted to get your update after the print there.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYeah. I'll let Tim talk about leading-edge foundry.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Yeah. Sure. No, in fact, we would hate for people to walk away thinking we're back to focused only on NAND. It's just that it's been many years we've been waiting for the NAND recovery to start. And so we're able to talk about the fact that through these upgrades, that's kind of begun and is showing up in our numbers. But the reality is, I mentioned the strategy we had to pivot more of our R&D and our new product expansion into DRAM and Foundry Logic. That is paying off. We gave a number on gate-all-around nodes. We have a number of tools that play very well into that inflection. Plus, our strength in advanced packaging shows up very prominently in leading-edge Foundry Logic. Since nearly all leading-edge Foundry Logic right now is driving and being driven by the advanced packaging capabilities. And so we're participating in that way.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nSo as you see leading-edge foundry logic customers spending, I would say that those are share gain opportunities for Lam at this point.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nThanks, Tom. Operator, we're going to take one more call. Yep.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nAnd that question is from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. For dry resist deposition and development, can you remind us of the SAM or maybe revenue potential per 10K wafer start per month? And then tied to that, what is the timing and magnitude of your revenue opportunity in this win? And where are you with other DRAM players?\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nListen, we're in good position. We've talked about previously a DQR position. We've got hardware in everybody's R&D facility. Everybody's looking at this that's using the EUV, is what I would tell you. We were super excited about this one because it's a production tool for the record decision, right? It's going to ramp. It's not going to be huge dollars this year, Brian, but it is going to certainly be generating revenue. But it was a real important milestone for us.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nOkay. That's great. Maybe for the quick follow-up, what factor does the introduction of wafer bonding on NAND roadmaps, I guess, have on your capture rate of NAND spending?\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nOh, in an upgrade, I mean, primarily, we do a lot of things mostly related to the stack is what we've been talking about. There are other elements of our, say, certain tools that can go into and play in the wafer bonding space, but we don't do wafer bonding itself. But I'd say it's minimal impact. I mean, our capture rate of an upgrade cycle is still very high.\n\n**Tim Archer** (President and CEO)\nThat's primarily as you stack to. We talked about carbon gap fill. We talked about the need to upgrade other tools to do higher aspect ratio metrics, etc. We haven't even talked about the fact that for many years, we've been selling tools that also help offset stress of higher layer counts. And so really, the complexity of these devices, now adding wafer bonding as well, it opens up a lot of opportunities for a critical process supplier like Lam to participate.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\n**Doug Bettinger** (EVP and CFO)\nYep. Awesome. Thank you, Brian. With that, Operator, we're going to wrap the call up. Listen, Tim and I and the rest of the management team are super excited to see you guys on February 19th in New York at our investor day. I hope you are all going to be able to make it. We'll have some interesting new products to talk about. And like I said, we're going to update the financial model. So, Operator, with that, let's close off the call.\n\n**Operator**\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
