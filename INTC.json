      "content": "**Operator**\nWelcome to Intel Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. Now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, and our CFO, David Zinsner. Lip-Bu will open with comments on our fourth quarter results, as well as provide an update on the progress we are making on our strategic priorities. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including first quarter guidance, before we transition to answer your questions. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nIt also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Lip-Bu.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThank you, John, and thank you all for joining us today. 2025 was a year of solid progress. Over the last 10 months, we established the foundation for new Intel, a more focused and execution-driven company. We simplified our organization and greatly reduced bureaucracy to improve efficiency and accelerate decision-making. We also recruited new leaders from the outside and empowered key leaders from within. We strengthened our balance sheet, forged strong new partnerships, and deepened relationships with existing as well as new customers. I'm encouraged by my conversation with our customers and partners around the world. I'm hearing a clear, consistent message. They see the progress we are making. They want Intel at the table as they navigate their own transformations. The opportunity in front of us is meaningful and significant.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThe era of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented demand for semiconductors across the entire compute landscapes, from AI-accelerated and traditional data centers into the network and enterprise domains, all the way out to client and edge devices. Rapid deployment of AI workloads across this diverse environment will require heterogeneous silicon solutions leveraging CPU, embedded NPUs, discrete and integrated GPU, ASICs, and XPUs. In addition, we will need to see innovations in the software stack along with new emerging technologies like photonics, memory interfaces, interconnect, and quantum to name just a few. The breadth of our IP and know-how across silicon design, system-level integration, wafer manufacturing, and advancred packaging uniquely position us to capitalize on these AI-driven trends, capture sustainable, profitable growth. This will not happen overnight, and our executions need to continue to improve.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nBut we will stay humble as we address the work ahead, and we will never be satisfied. Our Q4 was another positive step forward. Revenue, gross margin, and EPS were all above our guidance. We delivered these results despite supply constraints, which meaningfully limited our ability to capture all of the strengths in our underwriting markets. We are working aggressively to address this and better support our customers' needs going forward. Looking ahead for 2026, we will continue to position Intel to capture the significant growth opportunity AI presents across all our businesses. We will do this by strengthening our client franchise, advancing our data center, AI accelerator, and ASIC strategies, and continue to build trusted U.S. foundry. Let me start with our core x86 franchise, which remains the most widely deployed compute architecture in the world.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThe deployment of AI is only amplifying the importance of x86, from orchestration and control planes to inference edge workloads and agentic AI. In our client computing group, we strengthen our position in both consumer and enterprise notebooks with our Core Ultra Series 3 lineup, formerly known as Panther Lake, and build on our most advanced Intel 18A manufacturing process. We committed to deliver our first Series 3 SKU by the end of 2025, and we exceeded that commitment by delivering our first three SKUs. While we still have work to do, I'm encouraged by the steady progress on our Intel 18A use, and Nagar and his team remain laser-focused on additional improvements as they ramp Series 3 into the high volume needed to meet strong customer demand.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nOur client momentum was on full display at CES earlier this month, where we formally launched Series 3 with our OEM partners, powering over 200 notebook designs. Series 3 will be the most broadly adopted and globally available AI PC platform we have ever delivered. Along with our next-generation Nova Lake coming at the end of 2026, we now have a client roadmap that combines best-in-class performance with cost-optimized solutions, giving me confidence that we are on the path of fortifying market share and profitability in both notebooks and desktops over the next several years. In addition, PC becomes an important part of the AI infrastructure. The surge in AI workloads is driving massive demand for data centers, but cloud capacity alone cannot meet the scale of inference needed, especially in the power-constrained environment.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThis accelerates the push toward hybrid AI, splitting workloads between cloud and client, which offers clear advantages in performance, cost, and control. We are working closely with ecosystem partners to seamlessly enable hybrid AI, and we are encouraged by the opportunity to grow the install base and accelerate the refresh rates over time. Let me now turn to DCAI. To support our AI objectives, I believe that our traditional server and accelerator roadmaps must advance together. To reinforce the alignment, I am centralizing our data center and AI Group under one leader, ensuring tight coordination across CPUs, GPUs, and platform strategy. Demand for traditional servers continues to be very strong, and we are focused on ramping available capacity to support the meaningful uptick we are seeing, including partnering with key customers to support their needs beyond 2026.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThe continuing proliferation and diversification of AI workloads is placing significant capacity constraints on traditional and new hardware infrastructure, reinforcing the growing and essential role CPUs play in the AI era. This is and will continue to benefit the ongoing ramp of Granite Rapids, as well as our mainstream products, Sapphire Rapids and Emerald Rapids. We have also made decisive changes to simplify our server roadmap, focusing resources on the 16-channel Diamond Rapids and areas to accelerate the introduction of Coral Rapids where we can. With Coral Rapids, we will also reintroduce multithreading back into our data center roadmap. We also continue to work closely with NVIDIA to build a custom Xeon fully integrated with their NVLink technology to bring best-in-class x86 performance to AI host nodes. Over the last several quarters, we have been developing a broad AI and accelerator strategy that we plan to refine in the coming months.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThis will include innovative options to integrate our x86 CPU with fixed function and programmable accelerator IP. Our focus is on the emerging wave of AI workloads: reasoning models, agentic, and physical AI, and inference at scale, where we believe Intel can truly disrupt and differentiate. Our long-term ambition is clear: to rebuild Intel as a compute platform of choice for the next era of AI-driven computing, grounded in world-class engineering and accelerated roadmap, and a renewed culture of execution. We are also building momentum in ASICs as customers seek purpose-built silicon for AI, networking, and cloud workloads. Our combination of design services, IP building blocks, and manufacturing capabilities positions Intel well to resolve specialized problems at scale.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThis is not a new area for us, although it is one that I'm committing significantly more focused resources and investment dollars, including leveraging my own experience at Cadence Design, supporting and growing this market. Finally, we remain focused on the long-term objective of building a world-class wafer and advanced packaging foundry, anchored in trust, consistency, and execution. As I have said before, building a foundry business will take time and considerable effort and resources. While still early in our journey, we have hit some earlier important milestones worth highlighting. We are now shipping our first products built on Intel 18A, the most advanced semiconductor process developed and manufactured on U.S. soil. As stated earlier, yields continue to improve steadily as we work to ramp the supply needed to meet strong customer demand.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nIn addition, Intel 18AP continues to progress well, and we are engaging with internal and external customers on this node, delivering our 1.0 PDK at the end of the last year. Intel 14A development remains on track. We have taken meaningful steps to simplify our process flow and improve our rate of performance and yield improvement. We are developing a comprehensive IP portfolio on Intel 14A, and we continue to improve our design enablement approach. Importantly, our PDKs are now viewed by customers as industry standard. Engagements with potential external customers on Intel 14A are active. We believe customers will begin to make firm supplier decisions starting in the second half of this year and extending into the first half of 2027. We also have the opportunity to provide strong differentiation in advanced packaging, particularly with EMIB and EMIB-T.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nWe are focusing on improving quality and yield to support customer ramps beginning in the second half of 2026. In closing, I'm reflecting on 2025. I'm proud of the resilience and commitment our team has demonstrated. We exit the year with a stronger foundation and clearer roadmap for 2026 and beyond. The opportunity ahead is meaningful and significant as AI-driven computing expands all the markets we serve. But I'm also mindful of the challenges ahead of us and transparent about the areas that we are doing well and areas we need to improve. In the short term, I'm disappointed that we are not able to fully meet the demand in our markets. My team and I are working tirelessly to drive efficiency and more output from our fabs. While yields are in line with our internal plans, they are still below what I want them to be.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAccelerating yield improvement will be an important lever in 2026 as we look to better support our customers. As I said earlier, we are on the multi-year journey. It will take time and resolve, but my team and I are committed to rebuilding this iconic American company and increasing the long-term value for our shareholders. I would like to thank my team for their hard work over the course of the last 10 months. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we continue this journey together, including hosting an Investor Day in the second half of this year at our headquarters in Santa Clara. Let me now turn it over to Dave to walk through our financials and business trends in more detail.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThank you, Lip-Bu Tan. We remain encouraged by the fundamental drivers of demand across our core markets.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nFourth quarter revenue was $13.7 billion at the high end of the range we provided in October. We experienced strong growth across all our businesses, benefiting from the AI infrastructure build-out, with AI PC, traditional server, and networking revenue all up double digits sequentially and year over year. Q4 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue above our guidance, even as we navigate industry-wide supply constraints for our key products. Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 37.9%, approximately 140 basis points ahead of guidance on higher revenue and lower inventory reserves, partially offset by an increased mix of outsourced client products and the early ramp of Intel 18A to support the launch of Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake. We delivered fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 versus our guidance of $0.08, driven by higher revenue, stronger gross margins, and continued spending discipline.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nQ4 operating cash flow was $4.3 billion, with gross CapEx of $4 billion in the quarter and positive adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion. NVIDIA's $5 billion investment closed in Q4 as expected. For the full year, revenue was $52.9 billion, down slightly year over year due to constraints across our own manufacturing network and with external suppliers, which limited growth, especially in the second half. Full year Non-GAAP gross margin was 36.7%, up 70 basis points on reduced period charges. Full year Non-GAAP EPS was $0.42, up $0.55 year over year on lower period charges and improved operating leverage. Specifically, Non-GAAP OpEx of $16.5 billion was down 15% versus 2024, as we executed actions to reduce complexity and bureaucracy in the business and drive improved execution.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nFor the full year, we generated $9.7 billion in cash from operations and made $17.7 billion of gross capital investments, with capital offsets of approximately $6.5 billion. Although adjusted free cash flow was minus $1.6 billion in 2025, we produced $3.1 billion in the second half, as cash from operations more than doubled half on half. We exit 2025 with $37.4 billion of cash and short-term investments bolstered by further monetization of Mobileye, the completion of our stake sale of Altera to Silver Lake, accelerated funding from the U.S. government, and investments by the SoftBank Group and NVIDIA. In addition, we repaid $3.7 billion of debt. Looking back, 2025 marked an important year of progress against our key priorities, even as we know we have more work ahead.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nInternally, we reorganized and right-sized the team to become customer-centric and engineering-focused, while shoring up our balance sheet to give us more flexibility to pursue our goals. We've navigated a market that has shifted from tariff-driven uncertainty in the first half to an intense AI-driven demand environment constrained by supply in the second half. 2025 demonstrated the staying power of the x86 ecosystem across client and data center, and the importance of our manufacturing assets as we launched Core Ultra Series 3 on Intel 18A, the most advanced process fully developed and manufactured in the United States. Both create a firm foundation on which to build the new Intel. Moving to segment results, Intel products' Q4 revenue was $12.9 billion, up 2% sequentially. CCG revenue was down 4% quarter over quarter, even as AI PC units grew 16%, and DCAI was up 15%, reflecting strong demand for traditional server compute.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThese results reflect our efforts to balance our constrained supply with strong data center demand while maintaining support for our client OEM partners. Where possible, we're prioritizing our internal wafer supply to data center and leveraging an increased mix of externally sourced wafers in client. CCG revenue was $8.2 billion, and in line with our expectations. We estimate the client consumption TAM was greater than 290 million units in 2025, marking two straight years of growth off the post-COVID bottom in 2023 and the fastest TAM growth since 2021. Within the quarter, CCG launched three SKUs of Series 3 ahead of our expectations of one. Performance reviews have been extremely favorable, with up to 27 hours of battery life, a 70% gen-on-gen improvement in graphics, and performance on industry-standard benchmarks that is 50%-100% better than peers.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nDCAI revenue was $4.7 billion, up 15% sequentially, above expectations and the fastest sequential growth this decade. Revenue would have been meaningfully higher if we had more supply. While the market continues to benefit from more power-efficient CPUs, stimulating a refresh cycle, all indicators point to the growing and essential role CPUs will play within hyperscale and enterprise AI data centers as inference-driven AI usage expands. The world is shifting from human-prompted requests to persistent and recursive commands driven by computer-to-computer interactions. The CPU's central function coordinating this traffic will drive not only traditional server refresh, but new demand that grows the installed base. In addition, due to the networking demand for the AI infrastructure build-out, our custom ASIC business grew more than 50% in 2025, 26% sequentially, and reached an annualized revenue run rate greater than $1 billion in Q4.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThis strength provides our ASIC team a solid base to pursue a $100 billion TAM opportunity. Operating profit for Intel products was $3.5 billion, 27% of revenue, and down approximately $200 million quarter over quarter on an increased mix of outsourced products and seasonally higher operating expenses. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.5 billion, up 6.4% sequentially on increased EUV wafer mix. EUV wafer revenue grew from less than 1% of wafers out in 2023 to greater than 10% in 2025. External Foundry revenue was $222 million in the quarter, driven by projects with the U.S. government and the deconsolidation of Altera. Intel Foundry operating loss in Q4 was $2.5 billion and $188 million worse quarter over quarter, driven by the early ramp of Intel 18A. Within the quarter, Intel Foundry met key 18A and 14A milestones.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWith the official launch of Core Ultra Series 3, Intel Foundry is the only semiconductor manufacturer in the world shipping gate-all-around transistors with backside power for revenue. These advanced wafers are rolling off our production lines in Oregon and Arizona, here in the United States. Finally, our continued progress on Intel 14A demonstrates our commitment to research and develop the world's most important technology on U.S. soil. Turning to all other, revenue came in at $574 million and was down 42% sequentially due to the Q3 2025 deconsolidation of Altera. The primary components of all other in Q4 were Mobileye and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered an operating loss of $8 million. I'm pleased with the early momentum at Altera as an independent company with a new leadership team. Their industry-leading programmable fabric, developer productivity-driven software tools, and a large installed base positions them well to drive long-term value creation.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nNow, turning to guidance. During the second half of 2025, we supported strong demand for our products with interquarter wafer production and inventory on hand. As we enter 2026, our buffer inventory is depleted, and the mix shift in wafers towards servers, which began in Q3, will not come out of fab until late Q1 2026. As a result, and as we stated last quarter, our internal supply constraints are most acute in Q1. In light of these dynamics, we are forecasting a Q1 revenue range of $11.7-$12.7 billion. The midpoint of $12.2 billion reflects a lower end of seasonal Q1. Within Intel products, we forecast a more pronounced revenue decline in CCG than in DCAI as we continue to prioritize internal supply to our server and markets.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe expect Intel Foundry revenue of double digits quarter over quarter, helped by continued mix shift to EUV wafers and Intel 18A pricing. At the midpoint of $12.2 billion, we forecast a gross margin of approximately 34.5% with a tax rate of 11% and break-even EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin is down sequentially due to lower revenue, increased 18A volumes, and product mix. Let me take a few moments to provide some color for your full year 2026 model. First, from a revenue perspective, we expect our factory network to improve available supply beginning in Q2 and for each of the remaining quarters in 2026. Within the server market, customer feedback and our own market intelligence points to the likelihood of a strong year of growth for DCAI. Finally, client CPU inventory is lean, and there is excitement for Series 3.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIn contrast, over the last several months, industry-wide supply for key components like DRAM, NAND, and substrates has come under increasing pressure due to intense demand to support the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure. Rising component pricing is a dynamic we continue to watch closely, especially relative to the client market, and could limit our revenue opportunity this year. For OpEx, we target 2026 operating expenses of $16 billion. We expect non-controlling interest, or NCI, to net to approximately $325 million in Q1 and be approximately $1.2 billion for the year on a GAAP basis. NCI is expected to grow meaningfully again in fiscal 2027. Our share count is forecast to be 5.1 billion shares in Q1 and grow in line with our stock-based compensation going forward.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAs we think about our capital expenditures for 2026, we're working to balance our ability to drive capital efficiencies with our need to respond to the demand signals we're receiving. Previously, we said CapEx would be down, but are now planning for a range of flat to down slightly, and for expenditures to be more weighted to the first half. As a reminder, CapEx in 2026 would be to support demand in 2027 and beyond. We expect to generate positive adjusted free cash flow for the full year, and we're planning to retire all $2.5 billion of maturities as they come due this year. I'll wrap up by saying that Q4 was another solid quarter to mark our fifth consecutive quarter of over-delivering to our guide. We exit 2025 increasingly confident in the long-term sustainability of the end markets we serve.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe believe our improved balance sheet, thanks in part to the trust of our strategic partners, combined with the strong talent we have, will enable us to meaningfully participate in the next wave of computing as the industry pushes for returns on their AI investments. I look forward to providing you, our shareholders, an update on what this future means to you at our analyst day later this year. With that, I'll turn it over to John to start the Q&A.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up to allow us to accommodate as many of you as possible. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first question?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, and our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymour from Deutsche Bank.\n\n**Operator**\nYour question, please.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Analyst)\nHi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one is two quick parts, and it's both on supply. In the short term, are the yield improvements and the other actions you're taking sufficient to address just typical seasonality throughout the year, given that usually the first quarter would be the low point on revenues, and then perhaps more importantly, longer term on the supply side? You guys seem more confident in your 14A, your 18A, the customer engagements, your internal roadmap. When would you decide to loosen up the reins on the CapEx side of things so that you could address structurally higher demand going forward with more internal supply?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThanks, Ross, for the question. So on the short-term supply, certainly improving yields and throughput are a great driver of supply increases.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIn fact, it's got a great ROI to it because it doesn't require any incremental capital, so that's what Lip-Bu and I are actively working on to improve, and we're reasonably confident that there's a good trajectory there. That said, when you look at CapEx, it's a little bit more nuanced than just it's going to be flat to slightly down. It's actually down significantly in space, so we're spending a lot less in space. We think we have a good footprint in terms of clean room, and what we're devoting more of our dollars to is tools, so we are ramping up tool spending quite a bit in 2026 relative to 2025 to address this supply shortfall as well, and in fact, every quarter, we're seeing kind of wafer start increases pretty much across the board across Intel 7, Intel 3, and 18A.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nSo all three of them every quarter improve and get better to address the supply. And like I said, we think things will certainly improve in Q2, but we won't be completely out of the woods here. But as we progress through the year, we think things will get better and better. Can we take the 14A thing? Yeah. On 14A, Lip-Bu has been very direct with us on all of this. He does not want to spend on capacity on 14A, only spend on the kind of TD spend or R&D spend associated with 14A, even in the fab until we have customers secured. We've talked about the likelihood is our customers on 14A, their window to secure, or for us to secure them will be in the back half of this year and in the first half of next year.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAnd so once visibility improves there, we'll start to unlock the spend on 14A.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI can just add a little bit more. I think on the yield improvement, we see 7%, 8% yield improvement per month. I think it's more in focus in the variation, make sure that we can be more consistent delivery, and also the defect density at the end so that we can ship quality wafer to the customer. So I think all those are very important for our PC client, Panther Lake, and then also for the 18A and 14A development. So I think all in all, I see improvement, but still not quite to the industry leading standard yet.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nRoss, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Analyst)\nYeah, I do.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Analyst)\nThe gross margin side, Dave, you gave some puts and takes for the full year on a bunch of different metrics, but you didn't mention gross margin. How should we think about that? And forgive me, it's a 40%-60% incremental. I know you guys give kind of you can drive a truck through. So anything with perhaps just a little more precision directionally would be helpful. Thank you.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, and I'm not even sure the math is that good on this time around. When you look at Q1, the gross margin decline in Q1, there's two main components. Obviously, revenue coming down with a largely fixed cost business is going to affect gross margins. But the other piece of this is Panther Lake, while the cost structure improves from Q4 to Q1, it's still diluted to the corporate average, and it's a bigger percentage of the mix.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nSo it actually has a relatively negative impact on gross margin. So that's partly why we're guiding down. There's some mixed things going on as well. I think as we progress through the year, the two things should benefit us. One, we improve our supply, ergo, that should improve our revenue picture. On top of that, Panther Lake's cost structure gets better and better. Lip-Bu talked about the incremental improvement every month we're going to see in yields. We're working on the throughput as well. So those two things combined, that should help in terms of cost structure and make this more of an accretive product to us as opposed to a diluted product. And I think that will be a lot of what is the story around gross margins for the year. They're still mixed, and mixed can go any different direction depending on how things play out.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nBut what we're largely focused on for the kind of the next 12 months is driving the cost structure of these products that we're building to improve the margins. We know that 34.5% is by no means an acceptable level of gross margins. We're actively working at first to get it to 40%, and then once we get it there, we'll move to a new target.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Analyst)\nThanks a lot. Dave, I'm wondering in the guidance, you're guiding to 12/2, but I'm wondering if you can kind of pro forma that for us. If you could meet all the demand, what would the kind of unconstrained guidance be for March? Yeah.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIt's a squishy figure to figure out, Tim, but I would tell you that if you look at kind of that 12/2 relative to the 13/7 we posted in the fourth quarter and look at normal seasonality, it's in the range of seasonal, but it's at the low end of that range of seasonal. We'd be well above seasonal if we had all the revenue or supply, I should say, to hit the revenue.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nTim, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Analyst)\nI do. Thanks. Lip-Bu, there's obviously a lot of excitement about your foundry business. Sounds like we might get a few customer announcements maybe in the second half. But I just wanted to ask you, what do you define as like success in that business? I think prior to you arriving, the mantra was sort of to be number two, the number two foundry player by 2030.\n\n**Tim Arcuri** (Analyst)\nIf you look at most of the forecasts for that number two player, it's somewhere in the range of like $30 billion in revenue out by that time. Is this still kind of a reasonable bogey that you're shooting for? And what do you consider as a successful outcome for that? Thanks.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThanks. Good question. So I think we are determined to commit to drive the world-class foundry business. So I think, first of all, on the 14A, I think we clearly development is on track. We like what we see, and we simplify the whole process flow. Most important is kind of building up the IP portfolio so that we can serve the customer. Some of the IP is very critical in order to serve the customer. The other part is on the yield and improvement. We see trend of improvement, and we also see the variations getting better.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI think in the long run, I think clearly we are kind of anticipating that we have heavy engagement in some of the key customers. We think that the second half of this year, they're going to indicate to us what kind of capacity, firm commitment, so that we can deploy the capacity CapEx to really build that. So I think all in all, I think it's a service business. We really build the trust and the consistency. We're able to deliver. And then we have the PDK on the 14A, first quarter, 0.5. And then we're starting to engage with customers with the key products that they want to run with us. So I think all in process, I think the second half of this year, we were able to have the commitment that we can really drive the scale of the operation.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAnother early indicator, I think, of success in the foundry is going to be advanced packaging. And we'll start to see that revenue come in even before we start to see meaningful wafer revenue. And I think as I was talking to investors over the past kind of 12 to 18 months, I was thinking that those opportunities would be measured in hundreds of millions of dollars, and wafer opportunities would be measured in billions. I'd say some of the early customer engagements suggest that we'll be well north of $1 billion on many of these opportunities for advanced packaging. So they're way more exciting than even I had expected. And it's because we have really good technology there that's very differentiated and supports AI in a way that is particularly special.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, I think the EMIB team, I think it's a very big differentiator for us.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd then clearly, we have a couple of customers willing to even prepay the subscription because subscription is very big supply shortage, and then they're willing to share with us. That means that share the commitment they are going to working with us.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Analyst)\nYes, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about server prospects. You've sort of talked about some of the challenges of Diamond Rapids not having symmetric multi-threading, and Granite Rapids is going to be important. Can you give us a timeframe on Granite Rapids and sort of what's your expectation for the potential for market share, puts and takes as you wait for that to come?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, good question.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nSo I think first of all, I would centralize the data center and AI under Covert that I hired in to help us to build that. He already built the team and then recruit some of the talents on board. I think the more important right now, we are laser-focused in a 16-channel Diamond Rapids, and we simplify the product roadmap. And then the other part is accelerate the introduction of Coral Rapids. And Coral Rapids will have the reintroduce the multi-thread into our data center workflow. So I think overall, we are very positive. The team is in place now. The roadmap is very clear, and we are very decisive on doing that. And then laser-focus on the Diamond Rapids 16-channel and also accelerate the Coral Rapids introduction.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJody, you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Joe Moore** (Analyst)\nYeah, sure. Thank you for that.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Analyst)\nJust in terms of the mix for the rest of the year, are you able to move wafers towards data center away from PC? Is that something that you're thinking about? And just, it seems like the constraints are at their worst point in Q1 and get better, but I assume you're still constrained beyond that. Are you able to move the mix towards data center?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, we're absolutely constrained, Joe. So what we're doing within client, we're focusing on the mid and high end and not as focused on the low end. And then to the extent we have excess, we're pushing all of that into the data center space to meet that customer demand. And I think you'll see some share adjustments based on that because our primary focus is to our main customers. And obviously, we have important customers on the data center side.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe have important OEM customers on both data center and client, and that needs to be our priority to get the limited supply we have to those customers.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius. Your question, please.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks a lot. My first question is about seasonality throughout the year. So Dave and Lip-Bu, I mean, you're subseasonal in the first quarter. You said you'd be well above seasonal if you had the supply. So what does that imply for 2Q to 4Q? Should we model that above seasonal, or are the constraints in PC so much that we shouldn't? Thanks.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, thanks.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I mean, we would expect to be better than seasonal through the year if we can get the supply to where we think we can as we get into 2Q. So that's correct.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nBen, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Analyst)\nSure. I wanted to ask about with regard to the hyperscaler situation in servers. In terms of your momentum there, is this mostly driven by hyperscaler, or do you feel like the shortage is mostly impacting them, making you subseasonal, or is the enterprise demand also are you seeing it there? Thanks.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, I think that may answer that question. I think the hyperscaler is very important for us to scale the business, and I spend a lot of time with the hyperscalers. I think a couple of things.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nOne clear message from them is the CPU actually is driving a lot of their business in terms of the different workloads they're driving. So I think it's very encouraging to see that they are willing to commit to a long-term agreement to really prioritize their CPU deployment. So that's something that's very positive. And then secondly, I think they are very excited about working with us in terms of besides working on the silicon, the software, and the system-level engagement. And that's something that's also very exciting. So all in all, I think they are very strong. They've shared with us their workload, what they're looking at and what we can help them with. And also the ASIC design is an opportunity for us. They also want to build some of the purpose-built silicon with the Xeon CPU included.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd also they are very interested about overall, how do you use the advanced packaging and then to make it more complete? I think overall, I think it's a great opportunity for us to work with them.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, I wanted to dig a little bit into the segments. So I mean, if I sort of run the math, like Mobileye is going to be up and the Altera foundry revenues may be close to $200 million. I mean, I need both DCIA and client to be down pretty meaningfully. And if client's down more, I mean, maybe DCIA is down high single digits and client's down like mid-teens.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nBut I guess number one, is that true? And number two, why should data center be down so much given where the demand is and given where you're prioritizing? Why would I expect data center units to be down? Seems like they have to be down pretty meaningfully in Q1.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah. I mean, both will be down as a function of supply. Obviously, we're shifting as much as we can over to data center to meet the high demand, but we can't completely vacate the client market. So we're trying to support both as best we can and obviously work our way out of this supply issue. I do believe that the first quarter is the trough. We will improve supply in the second quarter.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nPart of the challenge is that in the third and fourth quarter of 2025, we lived off of supply, but we also had a reasonable chunk of finished goods inventory to also work through. Unfortunately, that is now down to kind of 40% of what it was at peak levels. So we don't have that to rely on. So it's just literally hand to mouth what we can get out of the fab and what we can get the customers is how we're managing it.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nStacy, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nI do, thanks. I mean, just to push on that a little bit. I mean, you guys have your own factories. Why are you in the inventory situation that you're in? And then I mean, even if you look at it, I get the whole idea about finished goods versus other stuff.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nBut I mean, you have $11.6 billion of inventory, and yet it's not in the right place at the right time to ship. How does that happen?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThat's largely what happens. I'll tell you, Stacy, I think the biggest thing is that if you go back six months or so ago and looked at what the outlook was, core count was absolutely looking like it would increase, but the units were not expected to increase. And every hyperscaler customer we talked to was signaling that. And obviously, it has rapidly increased over the third and fourth quarter. And in talking to a few of them right before this call, I got the feeling like it was going to be a story we'd feel for several years.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAnd yes, the advantage we have is we do have our own fab, so we can squeeze out supply as much as possible, which is what we're working on. But we directionally weren't managing the supply to an expectation that there would be unit increase that significantly in data center.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. For the first one, Lip-Bu, I'm curious, when do you think Intel should start getting any credit for external foundry efforts? Because you mentioned that you might hear of awards in the second half of this year. I assume that you'll start building the capacity for that, right, sometime late this year or next year.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nSo when do you actually start to get a decent amount of revenue from those customers? And I think you mentioned that building this business will take incremental amount of resources. So what level of external foundry revenue does Intel need to call this business a success? And when do you get that? Is it 2027? Is it 2028? Is it later?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, good question. I think first of all, I think the engagement with our potential external customer on the 14, they are very active right now. A couple of key customers are working with us. We expect them to really go through the milestone basis on 0.5 PDK and then starting to look at the test chip and look at how is our year performance. And it's going to be a process to work with them.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd then I think the second half of the year, then they're starting to satisfy. Then they're going to ask us, \"Okay, now this is the particular product we're going to run with your foundry and the productions.\" And then the indication to us, and that's the time. My discipline is until they have a commitment to the volume, then they're starting to really build and then the foundry expansion so that we can meet their requirement. And then the other part, parallelly, they also give us the list of IP. And now if it's a mobile-related, it has to be a low-power IP that we need to have. If it's data center-related, it clearly will be the performance, the connectivity, all these things that we need to really get it ready so that we can serve that as a service as a customer to meet their requirements.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nSo it's parallelly on the IP readiness and also our yield readiness. Then they starting to satisfy, \"Okay, now this product, this is a volume we're going to run with you, and that's how you're starting to build.\" So in terms of 14A, realistically, in terms of I call it the risk production in the later part of 2027 and real production, volume production in 2028. That is similar to the same timeframe as a leading foundry.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAnd I'd just say we probably will be able to give you a lot more color around all of these things at the analyst day that Lip-Bu mentioned we'll have in the back half of the year.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nVivek, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nYes. Thank you, John. For my follow-up, I'm curious, what do you think is the server CPU TAM in 2026? How much of that is x86?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nHow much of that is ARM? I mean, if you are supply constrained, is the entire industry supply constrained? Do you think that whatever you can't supply, all that market share is going to go to your x86 competitor and to everyone in the AI community that is building ARM-based servers? So when do you think your supply, how much does the market grow? And when do you think your server CPU supply constraints come off? Thank you.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nOkay. Maybe I'll start and you. So I think this demand, what we're seeing is largely an x86 phenomenon because it's an upgrade cycle in a lot of ways around older networks that have to talk in some way to the AI systems, and the performance is not where it needs to be. So I really view this as x86.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nOf course, we do have another competitor in the space, and we'll be jockeying for position from a market share perspective. I think we will make great strides on the supply as we progress through the year, so I wouldn't envision that to be the fundamental driver, ultimately of market share, and it's really about products, and Lip-Bu talked about getting 16-channel Diamond Rapids out, accelerating the introduction of Coral Rapids. Those will be the things that are most important for us as we look at market share dynamics in the coming years.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, I think from my side, I think clearly hyperscale and the high-end ODM is critical for us on the server side, and then we're basically working with them. Their first choice is the CPU from Intel, and that is a very clear message from them.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThey will try to get as much as we can give them. And then I think that's a key driver.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a follow-up on Stacy's question around supply. Considering your bullish commentary and AI-led demand and how you're supply constrained, and your peers, TSMC and Samsung, are aggressively slotting for equipment delivery, do you worry that if you wait for late 2026 to place orders, that the lead times then might be longer than you thought? And as part of that, why wouldn't you look to be more aggressive today?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah. I don't know if this is the answer to your question, but I mean, we are aggressively getting tools on Intel 7, Intel 18A.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThat is happening. And we will be increasing our wafer starts as aggressively as possible on those nodes. What we're holding back on is 14A because 14A is really linked to foundry customers. And it does not make sense to build out significant capacity there until we know that we have the customers that will accept that demand. And so that's just the discipline we're going to have. I'd say the other thing with regard to a lot of this around supply is Lip-Bu's first focus and our short-term focus is we think we can get a lot of supply just by doing things better with our existing tools and footprint, getting yields improved, getting cycle times improved. And we're aggressively working on that. And we think there's lots of opportunity to improve our supply just on those two things that don't require CapEx, quite honestly.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThat's something that's probably more unique to us right now than to other foundries.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nCJ, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nYes, John. And thanks, Dave, for the answer. Just to hit on the press release, you talked about demonstrating technical feasibility on high-end A for future HBM. And so just curious, is that something you're still contemplating for 14A, or is that more of a 10A adoption? Thank you.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIt will be part of our 14A process. Of course, there'll be different variants of 14A, but high-end A is targeted at 14A.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your question, please.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lip-Bu, as you look forward to 14A, you talked about engineering engagements with customers.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nTypically, the largest fabless semiconductor companies in the world want to run their own test chips to assess a new foundry node. They typically wait for PDK 0.4, 0.5 before they start their test chip designs. It looks like they can get started now on test chip design with the release of your PDK 0.5. I guess the question is, have customers commenced test chip designs, or are they maybe even further along than that, and customers are already running their own 14A test chips now? I mean, in order for them to make decisions on 14A in the second half, they need to be running their test chips fairly soon. If you could give us an update there.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, good question. I think you're absolutely correct.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nA couple of customers were already engaging about the PDK 0.5, and they are looking at the test chip, and also, more importantly, it's a specific product they're going to run to our fab foundry, and that one, we are working with them, and then, of course, they want to know the capacity, the pricing, those are all in the discussion right now, so that's why I mentioned the second half of this year, they're starting to satisfy, then they're starting to say, \"Okay, now we need this volume, and we need particular fab from yours to do it,\" and then also the other part is, do we have all the right IP to serve them, and so those are the things that we're parallelly processing with their supply chain and also their design team to work with them.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nSo this is a very complex step, and we are very familiar. We're working in the right way.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nHarlan, do you have a follow-up question, please?\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nYeah, thank you. On your server portfolio, I apologize if I missed this earlier, but Clearwater Forest, right, your e-core sort of cloud workload optimized server platform, it was targeted to be the first server platform to use your 18A manufacturing and ramp first half of this year. But Lip-Bu, you talked about server roadmap changes to focus on more performance-focused products. So is the team still supporting Clearwater Forest, or just focusing now on Diamond Rapids? And has the team taped out or taped in your next-gen Xeon 7 Diamond Rapids products and any preliminary views on ramp timing of Diamond Rapids?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah. So answering your question is yes, we continue to do this and support that.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd what I mentioned about focus on the 16-channel of Diamond Rapids is kind of a focus on the high-end of the Diamond Rapids so that we can really laser focus, really providing a differentiating competitive product. And then the other part is, as I mentioned in the past, this multi-threading is very important in terms of driving the performance. And the one that we can really come out with, it takes time to have that. And we're going to have that in the Coral Rapids. Now the question mark is, how much can we accelerate that? The pulling earlier because customers are really excited about that. So Lip-Bu, can you pull it up earlier? That's why I work with Nagar and his team, see what are the ways we can really drive that acceleration to bring the market, to bring the customer earlier.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nJonathan, we have time for one more question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our final question for today then comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Analyst)\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. And I have two if I can fit them in. But on the memory side and what we're seeing in the market, I'm curious of how you guys are seeing customers react to memory. Is there the potential demand destruction in the PC market? Just any kind of curiosity on what you're seeing in that. And how impactful is memory pricing to the gross margin given, obviously, I think, stronger-for-longer Lunar Lake demand?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, good question. So I think in the industry facing a very big challenge is the memory constraint and also the pricing. So I think we also listen to our customers.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nSome of the bigger players and the OEM and the bigger player in the hyperscale, they have more access into the memory allocations. So we kind of hear from them. And then secondly, I think some of the smaller ones, they are really challenging to scramble to get the memory. So I think that will be very important for us, Dave and I, how to allocate and also our sales grid and how to allocate to the right customer. We don't want to have a CPU we send to them, but they are missing the memory. They cannot complete the products. So we try to do it correctly. And then that is very important to have that intelligence and then also feedback from the customer to work with us so that we can fulfill their requirement, Dave.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I think on the Lunar Lake side, I think we've got what we need based on the current forecast. Of course, that could always be ticked up, and then we would need more memory, which would kind of impact gross margins. But we were relatively aggressive in terms of getting the memory early. So I feel like we're in a relatively good place there. Now, that said, those margins are low because the memory is in package. So that doesn't impact our gross margins as well. But I think we're largely in the place we thought we would be a quarter or two ago.\n\n**John Pitzer** (SVP of Investor Relations)\nAaron, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Analyst)\nI do. And I'll be really quick. I'm curious on the custom ASIC side. You talked about hitting $1 billion of run rate business. How do we think about the progression of that?\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Analyst)\nHow broad is the customer base within that opportunity set? Thank you.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, good question. I think Dave mentioned earlier is a $100 billion TAM market opportunity. We are delighted. We are already in the run rate of $1 billion. It's a robust demand. Customers are really excited about what we have in terms of the CPU, Xeon, and also the AI-related momentum. They're more building a purpose-built silicon for AI and network and cloud. That part, I think we continue to work on that. Also more important for them is also the advanced packaging, make that more compelling. That's an advantage of Intel that we can do both to provide the customer delight. That's, I think, a good opportunity for us. With that, thank you again for joining us today.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAs we move forward, I remain focused on disciplined execution and deep collaboration with our customers to seize the meaningful opportunity created by AI era. While we have a lot more to do, we are confident in the foundation that we built and the progress underway. We're looking forward to provide you another update in April.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nThank you for standing by and welcome to Intel Corporation's third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star one one on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star one one again. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. You may get back in the queue as time allows. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. Now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, John Pitzer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. Pat will open up with comments on our third quarter results, as well as provide an update on our progress implementing strategic priorities. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including fourth quarter guidance, before we transition to answer your questions. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nIt also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome this afternoon. We delivered a solid Q3 with revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share above guidance. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of improved execution delivered by the underlying growth in our core markets and the steady progress we are making to rebuild the company. While we are still a long way to go, we are taking the right steps to create sustainable shareholder value. We significantly improved our cash position and liquidity in Q3, a key focus for me since becoming CEO in March. This includes accelerated funding from the U.S. government, important investments from Nvidia and SoftBank Group, and monetizing a portion of Altera and Mobilize. The action we took to strengthen the balance sheet gave us greater operational flexibility and positioned us well to continue to execute our strategy with confidence.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nIn particular, I'm honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and Secretary Lafnick have placed in me. Their support highlights Intel's strategic role as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company with leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing. We are fully committed to advancing the Trump administration's vision to restoring semiconductor production and proudly welcome the U.S. government as essential partners in our efforts. We also made tangible progress to improve our execution this quarter. We remain on track not only to right-size the company by year-end, but also to evolve the talent mix, reestablish the engineering-first mindset, and optimize the executive and management levels across the organization. We are seeing a significant increase in day-to-day energy and collaboration as our employees return to office after a substandard period of remote and hybrid work. Let me dive deeper into our underlying business trend.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nOver the course of my career, I have had the privilege of contributing to multiple waves of disruptive innovation. I can't recall a time when I have been more excited about the future of computing and opportunities in front of us. We are still in the early stage of the AI revolution, and I believe Intel can and will play a much more significant role as we transform the company. This starts with our core x86 franchise, which continues to play a critical role in the age of AI. AI is clearly accelerating demand for new compute architectures, hardware, models, and algorithms. At the same time, it's fueling renewed growth of traditional compute as the underlying data and the resulting insights continue to rely heavily on our existing products from cloud to edge.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nAI is driving near-term upside to our business, and it is a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth as we execute. In addition, with unmatched compatibility, security, and flexibility, by virtue of being the largest install base of general-purpose compute, x86 is well-positioned to power the hybrid compute environment that AI workloads demand, particularly for inference, edge workloads, and agentic systems. It is a great starting point from which to rebuild our market position to revitalizing and rejuvenating the x86 ISA and positioning it for the new era of computing with great products and partnerships. Our collaboration with Nvidia is a prime example. We are joining forces to create a new class of products and experience spanning multiple generations that accelerate the adoption of AI for the hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nBy connecting our architectures through Nvidia NVLink, we combine Intel CPU and x86 leadership with Nvidia unmatched AI and accelerated computing strengths, unlocking innovative solutions that will deliver better customer experience and provide a beachhead for Intel in the leading AI platform of tomorrow. We need to continue to build on this momentum and capitalize on our position by improving our engineering and design execution. This includes hiring, promoting top architecture talents, as well as reimagining our core roadmap to ensure it is the best-in-class features. To accelerate this effort, we recently created the Central Engineering Group, which will unify our horizontal engineering functions to drive leverage across foundational IP development, test chip design, EDA tools, and design platforms. This new structure will eliminate duplications, improve time to decision-making, and enhance coherence across all product development.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nIn addition, and just as important, the group will spearhead the build-out of a new ASIC and design service business to deliver purpose-built silicon for a broad range of external customers. This will not only extend the reach of our core x86 IP, but also leverage our design strengths to deliver an array of solutions from general purpose to fixed-function computing. In client, we are on track to launch our first Panther Lake SKU by year-end, followed by additional SKUs in the first half of next year. This will help us to solidify our strong position in the notebook segment across both consumer and enterprise with cost-optimized products. Across our full PC stack, from our entry-level offering to our mainstream Core family, up to our highest performing Core Ultra family. In high-end desktop, competition remains intense, but we are making steady progress.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nArrow Lake shipments have increased throughout the year, and our next-generation Nova Lake product will bring new architectural and software upgrades to further strengthen our offerings, particularly in the PC gaming halo space. With this lineup, we believe we will have the strongest PC portfolio in years. In traditional servers, AI workloads are driving both refresh of the install base and capacity expansion, fueled by rapid growth in tokenization, the increased demands around data storage and processing, and the need to elevate power and space constraints. We remain the AI head nodes of choice, with strong demand for Granite Rapids, including instances across every major hyperscaler. We are listening to what customers need, and strong performance per watt and TCO are top of mind. As I shared with you last quarter, the key part is improving our multi-threading capabilities as we close existing gaps and work to regain shares.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nFinally, on our AI accelerator strategy, I continue to believe that we can play a meaningful role in developing compute platforms for emerging inference workloads driven by agentic AI and physical AI. This will be a far larger market than that for AI training workloads. We will work to position Intel as a compute platform of choice for AI inference, and we look to partner with a range of incumbents, as well as emerging companies that are defining this new compute paradigm. This is a multi-year initiative, and we will strike a partnership when we can deliver true differentiation and market-leading products. In the near term, we will continue delivering AI capabilities through Xeon AI PCs, Arc GPUs, and our open software stack. Looking ahead, we plan to launch successive generations of inference-optimized GPUs on the annual cadence that features enhanced memory and bandwidth to meet enterprise needs.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nTurning to Intel Foundry, our momentum continues. We are making steady progress on Intel 18A. We are on track to bring Panther Lake to market this year. Intel 18A yields are progressing at a predictable rate, and Fab 52 in Arizona, which is dedicated to high-volume manufacturing, is now fully operational. In addition, we are advancing our work on Intel 18A, and we continue to hit our PDK milestones. Our Intel 18A family is the foundation for at least the next three generations of client and server products. Our work with the U.S. government, within the secure enclave, and other committed customers. It is a critical node that will drive wafer volumes well into the next decade and generate a healthy return on our investment. On Intel 14A, the team continues to focus on technology definition, transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, and foundation IPs.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nWe remain active, engaged with potential external customers, and are encouraged by the earlier feedback, which helps us to drive and inform our decisions. Lastly, our advanced packaging activities continue to progress well, especially in the area like EMIB and EMIB-T, which we have true differentiation. Like our Intel products, my conviction in the market potential for Intel Foundry continues to grow. The rapid expansion of critical AI infrastructure is fueling unprecedented demand for wafer capacity and advanced packaging services that present a substantial opportunity demanding multiple suppliers. Intel Foundry is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this unprecedented demand as we execute. As I mentioned last quarter, our investment in Foundry will be disciplined, and we will focus on capability and scalability, giving us flexibility to ramp quickly, and we will only add capacity when we have committed external demand.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nBuilding a world-class Foundry is a long-term effort founded on trust. As a Foundry, we need to ensure that our process can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with their unique way of building their own products. We must learn to delight our customers as they count on us to build wafers to meet all their needs for power, performance, yield, cost, and schedule. It is only by doing this that they can rely on us as a true long-term partner to ensure their success. This requires a change of mindset that I'm driving across Intel Foundry as we position this business for long-term success. As we look ahead, my focus remains firmly on the long-term opportunity across every market we serve today and those we will enter tomorrow.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nOur strategy is crystallized around our unique strengths and value proposition, supported by the accelerating and unprecedented demand for compute in the AI-driven economy. Our leadership continues to strengthen. Our culture is becoming more accountable, collaborative, and execution-oriented, and my confidence in the future grows stronger every day. I look forward to keeping you updated as we advance our journey. I will now turn it over to David Zinsner for details on our current business trends and financials.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThank you, Lip-Bu. In Q3, we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue above our guidance, driven by continued strength in our core markets. Although we remain vigilant regarding macroeconomic volatility, customer purchasing behavior and inventory levels are healthy, and industry supply has tightened materially. Furthermore, we are increasingly confident that the rapid adoption of AI is driving growth in traditional compute and reinforcing momentum across our businesses. In client, we are five years post the COVID pull forward and are benefiting from the refresh of a larger installed base. Enterprises continue to migrate to Windows 11, and AI PC adoption is growing. In data center, the accelerating build-out of AI infrastructure is positive for server CPU demand from head nodes, inference, orchestration layers, and storage.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe are cautiously optimistic that the CPU TAM will continue to grow in 2026, even as we have work to do to improve our competitive position. Third quarter revenue was $13.7 billion, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 6% sequentially. Capacity constraints, especially on Intel 10 and Intel seven, limited our ability to fully meet demand in Q3 for both data center and client products. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40%, four percentage points better than our guidance on higher revenue, a more favorable mix, and lower inventory reserves, partially offset by higher volume of Lunar Lake and the early ramp of Intel 18A. We delivered third quarter earnings per share of $0.23 versus our guidance of break-even EPS, driven by higher revenue, stronger gross margin, and continued cost discipline.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nQ3 operating cash flow was $2.5 billion, with gross CapEx of $3 billion in the quarter and positive adjusted free cash flow of $900 million. One of our top priorities for 2025 was shoring up our balance sheet. To that end, we executed on deals to secure roughly $20 billion of cash, including three important strategic partnerships. We exited Q3 with $30.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. In Q3, we received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, $2 billion from SoftBank Group, $4.3 billion from the Altera closure, and $900 million from the Mobilize stake sale. We expect Nvidia's $5 billion investment to close by the end of Q4. Finally, we repaid $4.3 billion of debt in the quarter, and we will continue prioritizing deleveraging by paying maturities as they come due in 2026.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nMoving to segment results for Q3, Intel products revenue was $12.7 billion, up 7% sequentially and above our expectations across client and server. The team executed well to support upside in the quarter, given the current tight capacity environment, which we expect to persist into 2026. We are working closely with customers to maximize our available output, including adjusting pricing and mix to shift demand towards products where we have supply and they have demand. CCG revenue was $8.5 billion, up 8% quarter-over-quarter and above our expectation due to a seasonally stronger TAM, Windows 11-driven refresh, and a stronger pricing mix with the ramp of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake. Within the quarter, CCG further advanced its relationship with Microsoft through a collaboration with Windows ML and the deep integration of Intel vPro manageability, with Microsoft Intune enabling secure, cloud-connected fleet management for businesses of all sizes.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThe team also met all key milestones in support of launching Core Ultra three, codenamed Panther Lake. We expect the client consumption TAM to approach 290 million units in 2025, marking two straight years of growth, up the post-COVID bottom in 2023. This represents the fastest TAM growth since 2021, and we're prudently preparing for another year of strong demand in 2026 as Core Ultra three ramps into a healthy PC ecosystem. TCAI revenue was $4.1 billion, up 5% sequentially, above expectations, driven by improved product mix and higher enterprise demand. The strength in host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute continued in the quarter, even as supply constraints limited additional upside. Our latest Xeon six processors, codenamed Granite Rapids, offer significant benefits, including up to 68% TCO savings and up to 80% less power as compared to the average server installed today.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIt is increasingly clear that CPUs play a critical role today and will going forward within the AI data center as AI usage expands and especially as inference workloads outpace that of training. Some data center customers are beginning to ask about longer-term strategic supply agreements to support their business goals due to the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure. This dynamic, combined with the underinvestment in traditional infrastructure over the last couple of years, should enable the revenue TAM for server CPUs to comfortably grow going forward. Operating profit for Intel products was $3.7 billion, 29% of revenue, and up $972 million quarter-over-quarter on stronger product margin, lower operating expenses, and a favorable compare due to period costs in Q2. Before discussing Intel Foundry, I want to acknowledge the tireless effort of the Nvidia and Intel teams.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThere's a lot of work in front of us, but the collaboration we announced this quarter was the culmination of almost a year of hard work with a company that cuts no corners and prioritizes engineering excellence above all. The x86 architecture has been the foundation of the digital revolution that powers the modern world. AI is the next phase of that revolution, and we're on a path to ensure x86 remains at the heart of it. Engagements like this one with Nvidia are critical to this effort. Moving to Intel Foundry, Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, down 4% sequentially. In Q3, Intel Foundry delivered Intel 10 and seven volume above expectations, met key 18A milestones, and released hardened 18A PDKs to the ecosystem. Foundry also advanced the development of Intel 14A and continues to make progress, expanding its advanced packaging deal pipeline.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIntel Foundry operating loss in Q3 was $2.3 billion, better by $847 million sequentially, primarily on favorable comparison due to the approximately $800 million impairment charge in Q2. As Lip-Bu Tan discussed, our confidence in the long-term Foundry TAM continues to grow, bolstered by accelerating deployment and adoption of AI and the growing need for wafers and advanced packaging services. Projections are calling for a greater than 10X increase of gigawatts of AI capacity by 2030, creating significant opportunities for Intel Foundry with external customers, both for wafers and our differentiated advanced packaging capabilities like EMIB-T. We continue the work to earn the trust of our customers, and our improved balance sheet flexibility will allow us to quickly and responsibly respond to demand as it comes.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nTurning to All Other, revenue came in at $1 billion, of which Altera contributed $386 million and was down 6% sequentially due to the intra-quarter closure of Altera. The three primary components of All Other in Q3 were Mobilize, Altera, and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $100 million of operating profit. Now turning to guidance. For Q4, we're forecasting a revenue range of $12.8 to $13.8 billion. At the midpoint and adjusting for the Altera de-consolidation, Q4's revenue is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. We expect Intel products up modestly sequentially, but below customer demand as we continue to navigate a tight supply environment. Within Intel products, we expect CCG to be down modestly and DCAI to be up strongly sequentially as we prioritize wafer capacity for server shipments over entry-level client parts.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe expect Intel Foundry revenue up quarter over quarter on increased Intel 18A revenue and its external Foundry revenue up due to the de-consolidation of Altera. For All Other, which now excludes Altera, we expect revenue to decline consistent with Mobilize guidance, partially offset by sequential growth in IMS. At the midpoint of $13.3 billion, we forecast a gross margin of approximately 36.5% down sequentially due to product mix, the impact of the first shipments of Core Ultra three, which has the typically higher cost you see in the early stages of a new product ramp, and the de-consolidation of Altera. We forecast a tax rate of 12% and EPS of $0.08, all on a non-GAAP basis. We expect non-controlled income to be approximately $350million-$400 million in Q4 on a GAAP basis, and we forecast an average fully diluted share count of roughly 5 billion shares for Q4.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nMoving to CapEx, we continue to anticipate 2025 gross capital investment will be approximately $18 billion, and we expect to deploy more than $27 billion of CapEx in 2025 versus $17 billion deployed in 2024. I'll wrap up by saying we exit Q3 with a significantly stronger balance sheet, solid demand in the near term, and growing confidence in our core x86 franchise, as well as the longer-term opportunities in Foundry, ASICs, and accelerators. We also recognize the work we need to do to reach our full potential. We continue to add external talent and unlock our workforce to improve our execution across product and process development, as well as manufacturing. We will closely manage what's in our control, react quickly as the environment evolves, and focus on delivering long-term shareholder value. At this time, I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask your question and congratulations on the strong results. Pat, the first one for you is going to be on the Foundry side. You guys announced a ton of collaborations in the quarter. You very much strengthened your balance sheet, and the tone you took in your preamble sounds much more confident on the progress you're making in Foundry. Do any of these collaborative announcements or equity investments go into that increased confidence, or are there some sort of technical merits that you're seeing that are rising your optimism in that part of your business?\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nYeah, Ross, thank you so much for the questions. I think a couple of announcements we make is, I think, clearly more on the product side. One is the SoftBank because they're building up all the infrastructure, AI infrastructure that definitely would need more capacity on the Foundry side. I think that would be the answer. Meanwhile, I think saying that, you know, I think clearly from what I receive from the 18A and 14A, we make tremendous good progress. You know, the steady progress on 18A, and Panther Lake would depend on it. Clearly we see the yield in a more predictable way. I visit Fab 52 that, you know, fully in operation for the 18A. On the 14A, clearly we're engaging with multiple customers in terms of milestone basis. Now we also really driving some of the yield and performance reliability that I'm seeing improvement.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nAlso more exciting, the advanced packaging, we also see important demands from some of the key customers from Foundry, from the cloud able, and also enterprise side. I think overall, I think we're looking quite excited to build this long-term trust with some of the customers and scaling it. We also focus on hiring some of the top talent, driving some of the process technology improvement.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nRoss, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah, I do. One for Dave on the gross margin side of things. You talked through the upside in the third quarter and the sequential downside in the fourth. Could you just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses as we think about 2026, just kind of directionally? I guess where I'm going is it seems like the biggest improvement has to come on the Foundry gross margin side of things. Is that the biggest driver? What drives it? As those gross margins go up, does that have any impact on the Intel products gross margin?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, sure, Ross. Obviously we're not going to guide 2026, but I think I can give a little bit of color. First of all, just be mindful that Altera is out of the numbers in 2026. They were in a large part of the numbers for 2025. That's probably a point of margin headwind for us because they were accretive to our gross margins. That's going to be a little bit of a challenge to overcome. I'd say we still believe in this 40%-60% fall through for margins. Of course, it's a little bit of a range you could drive a truck through, quite honestly. A lot of it's because of mix. We'll have, obviously, Lunar Lake will be a big component at least in the first half of the year, and that is a dilutive product to us.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nPanther Lake, while obviously is going to be a great cost structure for us over time, given the wafers are fabbed internally, initially, when you got a new product on a new process, they're pretty expensive products to start with. It's dilutive in the beginnings of the year, and then it gets better over the course of the year. I do agree we should see gross margins improve on the Foundry side for sure. Partly that is the scale dynamic that we will see benefit from. Also, as we move towards more leading edge mix, 18A for sure, but also even Intel four or 3, those products have better pricing and a better cost structure. Those margins should be accretive. The dynamic about how much it improves will largely be a function of how the mix plays out through the year.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nGreat, thank you. I was really interested in a lot of the prepared remarks around the sort of differences to your approach to Foundry. You talked about this last quarter and this quarter that you're sort of looking for customer commitments before you make the investment. Can you just talk about how those conversations are going? I certainly, you know, I can see the trade-off from a customer standpoint. They're making a commitment to you. Do they expect that capacity to be built ahead of time? Is there a bit of a chicken and egg aspect to these investments and just how are you approaching those conversations?\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nYeah, Joseph, thank you so much for the question. I think on the Foundry side, clearly we are engaging with multiple customers. As the building the trust of the customer, you need to really show the yield improvement, reliability, and also you need to have all the, you know, specific IP that they require. It's a service industry. You need to have all the right IP. That's why I formed the central engineering to get all the right IP to matching with the customer requirement. I think the best way is really, you know, show the performance, the yield, and then we can attach chip so that they can really work on it. Then they can start to deploy their most important revenue wafer to depend on us so that we can drive that success for them. I think those are very important.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nIn terms of potential investment and collaboration, I think with the different customers, different requirements, we're working with them. More important is to get their commitment to the Foundry and the support. I think that's building the trust that's more important.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, maybe just to add on, I would say that, you know, I think customers understand that it takes time from the time you deploy capital to the time where you have output. Our expectation is we, you know, we'll get those commitments firmed up in time to deploy the capital in time to meet the demand. I'd also say we're in a reasonably decent position given the CapEx investments we've already made. We have a lot of the assets on the books and in what we call assets under construction. We've made a lot of investments around the shell space. We do see line of sight to driving a reasonable amount of supply for our external foundry customers with our existing footprint and quite honestly with the use of the assets under construction and reuse of equipment that we have on the books today. I think we have flexibility.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nObviously, if things go better, you know, we may be looking to invest more and do that more quickly, but we feel reasonably confident we can react to the situation.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJoe, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nI do, yeah. Separately, the supply constraints in server CPUs and other CPUs, we see those in the market. I guess, you know, but your growth was 5% sequentially, single-digit growth year on year. I guess where is the shortage coming from? Is there just better demand ahead that you're not able to meet? Is it some of the transitions that you guys have made? I certainly see that tightness in the marketplace. I'm not arguing with it, but I'm just curious, you know, where you see that shortage coming from and how it'll get resolved.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I mean, the shortage is pretty much across our business, I would say. We are definitely tight on Intel 10 and seven. Obviously, we're not looking to build more capacity there, and as we get more demand, we're constrained. In some ways, we're living off of inventory. We're also trying to kind of demand shape to get customers to other products. There's also shortages even beyond our specific challenges on the Foundry side. I think there's widely reported substrate shortages, for example. Obviously, I think the demand, there's a lot of caution coming into the year, I think, across the board. It looks like things are going to be stronger this year, and probably that continues well into next year. I think everybody is trying to manage through it.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes to the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\n**Christopher Muse** (Senior Managing Director and Semiconductor Equipment Analyst)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a follow-up on the current outlook for demand outpacing supply into 2026. Curious if that's a comment largely focused on server or also including clients. I guess depending on your thoughts there, how should we be thinking about Q1 trends versus normal seasonality, which typically I guess would be down high single digits, low double digits?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, it's both. Although, as we said, you know, we are yielding a bit of the small core market in client to fulfill customer requirements more broadly on the client space and more specifically in the server space. That's how we're kind of trying to manage it. As you look into Q1, obviously, this is something we'll probably give you a lot more color around in January. I would just say, we may actually be at our peak in terms of shortages in the first quarter because we've lived through Q3 and Q4 with a little bit of inventory to help us and just cranking the output as much as we could with the factory. We probably won't have as much of that luxury in Q1. I'm not sure we'll buck the trend on seasonality given the fact that we're going to be really, really tight in the first quarter.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAfter that, I think we'll start to see some improvements and we can get ourselves caught up as we get through the rest of the year.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nCJ, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Christopher Muse** (Senior Managing Director and Semiconductor Equipment Analyst)\nI do, John. Thank you. I guess given the investments from the U.S. government and Nvidia, SoftBank, etc., I'm curious with that improved cash position and liquidity, how has your thinking evolved in terms of investments in either CapEx or making other investments in your product businesses?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I mean, obviously we're in a great position. I'd say, you know, as we think about this cash, our first focus is to delever. That's one of the things we really wanted to, you know, when Pat came in, he really was upset about Foundry. We've done a lot to work on that and improve that for him. We took $4.3 billion of debt off the books this quarter, and all the maturities next quarter or next year should come off, and we'll repay that. I think as you look at CapEx, it puts us in a position of flexibility on CapEx, but we want to be very disciplined around CapEx. We will absolutely be looking at demand. Pat's been very direct with us on this. He wants to see the whites of the eyes of the customer that we can believe in that demand.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIf that demand exists, of course, we will amp up the CapEx as necessary. As you think about investment, we still think that $16 billion of CapEx investment for next year is the right amount. Although Pat and I are constantly now looking at how we mix that $16 billion to drive the best possible growth and return for investors, and we will be making those changes. Beyond that, we'll see how things go. We want to be pretty disciplined about our OpEx as a percent of revenue and drive leverage. We do see opportunities to make investments that can, I think, deliver great returns for shareholders, and we're not afraid to do that either.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of Blaine Curtis from Jefferies. Your question, please.\n\n**Blaine Curtis** (Managing Director and Head of Semiconductor Equity Research)\nHey guys, thanks. I had two. Just on the CapEx, I think you reiterated $18 billion, but I think you spent, I guess, less than I was modeling Q3. Is that really still a number? I'm just kind of curious, as you start to ramp this 18A in Arizona, is there a way to think about the timing of when you add capacity there?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nOn the $18 billion, yeah, I think that's still the number. Obviously, CapEx can be lumpy. It depends on when things get, you know, when all the requirements associated with paying the invoice are completed. That's when we make the payments. We would expect to be somewhere in that range. Obviously, you know, there's an error bar around that. It might be a little bit less or a little bit more than that. 18A, you know, we still have to ramp this. I wouldn't expect significant capacity increases in the near term. I think, as we said, we are not at peak supply for 18A. In fact, we don't get there until the end of the decade. We do think that this node will be a fairly long-lived node for us. We will continue to make investments on 18A over time.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThere will be CapEx investments next year, but I wouldn't expect the supply to, at least, capacity to significantly change vis-à-vis our expectations right now.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nBlaine, do you have a quick call?\n\n**Blaine Curtis** (Managing Director and Head of Semiconductor Equity Research)\nYeah, thanks, John. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin trajectory as 18A layers in. I know, you know, comparing it to probably the prior couple of nodes, not a great compare, but maybe to a successful one. When you say yields are in a good spot and improving, is there a way to think about where those 18A yields are versus a successful product that you've seen in your history and, you know, kind of thinking about how that layers in in the first half?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I would say in general, I'm not sure yields in older nodes have been a big focus of ours, quite honestly. We're blazing a new trail on this. Yields are, what I would say, the yields are adequate to address the supply, but they are not where we need them to be in order to drive the appropriate level of margins. By the end of next year, we'll probably be in that space. Certainly the year after that, I think they'll be in what would be kind of an industry-acceptable level on the yields. I would tell you on Intel 14A, we're off to a great start. If you look at Intel 14A in terms of its maturity relative to Intel 18A at that same point of maturity, we're better in terms of performance and yield. We're off to an even better start on Intel 14A.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe just got to, you know, kind of continue that progress.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nHi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back and ask about these supply constraints again. You talked a lot about how AI was driving a lot of demand across servers and across PCs, but at the same time, it doesn't look like customers want your AI products. In fact, they can't get enough of the older stuff. I guess, I mean, you must have plenty of supply for Granite and for Meteor and even for Lunar Lake. How are you going to get the customers off of the older products where they haven't shown any desire to get off of them so far, even given the constraints that they've been under? I guess, how do we think about the transition of those customers? Because you're clearly, I mean, you even said it yourself, you're not adding any more of the older capacity.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nIn fact, you took some of it offline, right?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, good question, Stacy. I would, you know, I think it's a misnomer to say AI hasn't done well. I mean, it was sequentially up double digits quarter-over-quarter. We talked about a number of about, you know, we would ship about 100 million units by the end of this year on AI PC, and we're going to be first order in that range. I think it's going pretty well. Clearly, though, the older nodes have also done well, and that was probably the part that was more unexpected. I think we've just got to participate in making sure that the ecosystem drives enough applications for AI in the PC space. We work with the ISVs regularly to drive that. They're getting there. It's, you know, like any market, it starts relatively immature and kind of builds out over time.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nEven in our company, we're starting to find uses for AI PCs. In fact, IR is coming up with one here that we'll be using. I think it's just kind of time. That said, what clearly is happening is the Windows refresh is happening more significantly than I think we expected. That's not necessarily an AI PC story. Raptor Lake is also a product that addresses that. We're just seeing upside in that part of the market as well.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nStacy, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nI do, thank you. Dave, I want to follow up on two things that I think I heard you say on 18A. I thought I heard you say, number one, that yields would not be in a great place, at least until the end of next year. I thought I also heard you say that we're not going to be adding a lot of 18A capacity next year. Did I hear those wrong? I mean, how can, especially the latter one, how can that be true if you're ramping Panther? Or is that like a consequence?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe're obviously at our infancy. What I'm saying is, you know, relative to the CapEx plan, it's not like we're going to incrementally add supply for Intel 18A next year. Yes, of course, we're going to be ramping the volume over the course of the next year. Yeah,I wouldn't say Intel 18A yields are in a bad place. They're where we want them to be at this point. We had a goal for the end of the year, and they're going to hit that goal. To be fully accretive in terms of the cost structure of Intel 18A, we need the yields to be better. That's like every process. That's what happens. It's going to take all of next year, I think, to really get to a place where that's the case.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director, TMT Semiconductors Research Analyst)\nHey guys, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about some comments Lip-Bu Tan made in the prepared remarks about fixed function computing and potentially supporting more ASICs. Could you provide more context on the scope of this? Is this for potential foundry customers or are these products? If it's products, what types of applications do you expect to be supporting with custom silicon? Thank you.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nGood question. I think first of all, I just mentioned about the central engineering. We are driving the ASIC design, and that will be enhanced. Actually, it's a good opportunity for us to enhance, extend our reach of the core x86 IP, and also drive some of the purpose-built silicon for some of our system and cloud player and customer. Definitely, with the Foundry and packaging, also, that will be helping us in terms of their requirement. In all, I think this AI will be driving a lot of growth, especially in the double down of the Moore's Law. That will help us a lot in our x86 uplift. There's an opportunity for us to build that whole ASIC design to serve some of the customer requirements.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJosh, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Joshua Buchalter** (Director, TMT Semiconductors Research Analyst)\nYeah, on the last quarter, obviously the disclosure that, you know, you may decide to abandon 14A got a lot of attention. I just wanted to ask, you know, given your balance sheet is in a lot different spot than it was three months ago, has anything changed from that regard? I mean, I don't think the Q is out, so I haven't seen if any of the language changed there. I was curious if anything had moved around since last quarter, given all the changes in your balance sheet. Thank you.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nYeah, since the last quarter, I think clearly our engagement with the customer for 14A has increased. We are very heavily engaging with the customer in terms of defining the technology, the process, the yield, and the IP requirement to serve them. They clearly see the tremendous demand that they need to have Intel to be strong on the 14A. And so we are delighted and more confident. Meanwhile, we're also attracting some of the key talent for the process technology that can really drive success. That's why it gave me a lot of more confidence to drive that.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitz from Melius. Your question, please.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Managing Director and Head of Technology Research)\nHey, thanks guys. Lip-Bu, can we get an update on the Nvidia relationship, timing of products? Have you gotten any feedback from customers in terms of your ability to articulate on the materiality of the relationship and in terms of timing and materiality or any other color you want to give us on that? Thanks so much.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nThank you. This is a very important collaboration with Nvidia. It's a great company, as you guys know. I've been, you know, as a friend of Jensen for more than 30 years. We are very excited about this effort of Intel CPU 86 leadership and their unmatched AI and accelerated computing, then connecting with their NVLink. That will really create a new class of product in the multi-generations. This is something that is very heavy engineering to engineering engagement. That will be driving some of the new products that custom data center and PC products, and that really optimized for the AI era. I think all in all, I think this is going to be multiple years of engagement and then addressing a market that we are excited and also driving some of the requirements for the AI infrastructure.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nMaybe just one more addition. What makes this really special for us is it's not attacking our existing TAM. It's an incremental opportunity for us to expand the TAM. These are great opportunities for us.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nBen, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (Managing Director and Head of Technology Research)\nYeah, thanks, John. Lip-Bu, you mentioned a little bit about your AI strategy now, you know, to attack the inference market and that there's, you see room for, you know, Intel solutions. It sounds like you're going to partner a lot there. Is this strategy more about partnering? Is it more about, is there a specific Intel IP, you know, for inferencing that you're excited about? Or is it more of a Switzerland approach where you could partner with a lot of the existing players out there to attack more of the TAM? Thanks.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nYeah, good question. I think with the AI driving a lot of growth, we definitely want to play in that. I think this is a very early ending, and that's an opportunity for us. One area that we are focused on is revitalizing our x86 and to really tailor to purpose-built CPU, GPU requirements for the new AI workload. Then really addressing the power-efficient agentic and managing all the different agents. This is a new way of compute platform of choice, and that will be also applying to the system and software. You're going to say too, I think we're going to be partnering with some of the incumbents and also the emerging companies that are driving some of these changes.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks a lot. Dave, it's not that often we see high fixed cost businesses that are constrained, that have gross margins less than 40%. I certainly get that most of this is because of the wafer costs for Intel 10 and 7, and you still have low yields on 18A. I'm wondering, and this is probably a hard question to ask or to answer, but I wonder if you could maybe just kind of fast forward a bit and say like, what would gross margin be if you were off of 10 and seven and you were on 18A? Is there a way you could like normalize it for us?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I mean, obviously you may be listening in on some of my conversations with the team here, because that's definitely something I've been making the point of. You know, I would say there's two dynamics, one of which you're hitting on, and that is the high cost of older processes versus the better cost structure for the newer processes. That's obviously meaningful. I mean, we're in negative gross margin territory for Foundry. That makes a meaningful improvement if you move even into the positive territory. The other aspect of our gross margins is a function of just the product quality. We're in reasonably decent shape on client in terms of product performance and competitiveness, with a few exceptions, but we're not where we need to be on a cost basis. We've got to make improvements there. We have that on the roadmap.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThe team recognizes it, but that's a multi-year process to get there. It's more pronounced on the data center side. Not only do we not have the right cost structure, but we also don't have the right competitiveness to really get the right margins from our customers. We've got work to do there. That's what Lip-Bu and the team he's pulled in are hyper-focused on, is getting great products at the right cost structure to try better gross margins. That to me, I think, is the linchpin in all this. The improvements on the Foundry side are just going to come, I think. We're going to mix higher and higher to Intel three, four, and then, 18A and ultimately 14A. The cost structures of all of those are actually pretty similar.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYou know, it'll just be a function of the fact that the value that's provided by those leading edge nodes is going to be significantly more, and that's going to just materially drive the gross margins up. The other thing that I would say is we are seeing a lot of startup costs by virtue of the fact that we've jammed a whole bunch of new processes in kind of in rapid fashion. As we get into 14A, our cadence will be more normalized, and you won't see so much startup costs stacked on top of each other, which is affecting our gross margins. That's billions of dollars. I think, as you get beyond a few years, that rolls off and will also help.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nTim, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nI do, yeah. Lip-Bu, you didn't give an update last call on Diamond Rapids' launch date. I know the whole, you know, roadmap's under review, but you did sound, you know, the company sounds fairly optimistic about Coral Rapids. Can you just give us sort of an update on the data center roadmap a bit here? Thanks.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nThank you. Good questions. I think clearly the Diamond Rapids are getting stronger hyperscale feedback. We also focus on the new product, the Coral Rapids. That will include the SMT, the micro threading, and that can drive higher performance. We are in the definition stage, and we will work out the roadmap, and we are going to execute that. That will be going forward.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nThanks, Tim. Jonathan, we have time for one last question.\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our final question for today comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nYeah, thanks for fitting me in here. Just a couple of real quick ones. I guess going back to the Nvidia relationship, I can appreciate that the announcement was really tied to the NVLink fusion strategy and integrating that with the x86 ecosystem. I think there's been also some recent reports about maybe using Gaudi for some dedicated inference workloads within a stack of Nvidia. How do you, you know, is this relationship, you know, a starting point, and should we expect to see more potential integration beyond NVLink going forward?\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nYeah, I think, let me answer that. I think NVLink is kind of more the hub to connecting the x86 and GPU. In terms of the AI strategy, we clearly are defining the, you know, Crescent Island that we talked about. We also have a new product line in the lineup. They're addressing the agentic and the physical AI and more in the inference side. I think stay tuned. We will update that.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP, Investor Relations)\nAaron, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst)\nI do, and I'll make it really short. You know, can you just update us on how we think about the NCI, the non-controlling interest expense, as we look through this year and think about that? I think you've given some comments in the past of how we should think about that in the 2026. Thank you.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I think 2026, we're looking at somewhere in the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range is probably a good estimate. Obviously, we're focused on that, and you know, we'll work to minimize that as much as possible.\n\n**Pat Gelsinger** (CEO)\nWith that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We are on the journey of rebuilding Intel, and we have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are making solid progress in Q3. I look forward to seeing many of you throughout the quarter and providing you with another update in January.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nThank you for standing by and welcome to Intel Corporation's Second Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Lip Bu Tan and by our CFO, David Zinsner. Lip Bu will open with comments on our second quarter results as well as provide an update on our strategy and priorities.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nDave will then discuss our overall financial results, including third quarter guidance, before we transition to answer your questions. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10 ks, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nWith that, let me turn things over to Lip Bu.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome. We had a solid Q2 with revenue above the high end of our guidance. This reflects strong demand across our business and good execution by the team. As expected, headline profitability was impacted by several one time items and impairments. But I am pleased by the underlining operating performance in the quarter, even as we have more work to do.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nDave will go through our detailed financials shortly. Today, I want to provide you with updates on four major initiatives where we have started to make progress and will continue to focus in coming quarters. Our organisation and culture, our foundry strategy, our core x86 franchise, and our AI strategy. First, on organization and culture. Over the last three months, I have completed a systematic review of every organisation and function reporting to the CEO.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThese reviews included detailed analysis of headcount, skill sets, spending, site distribution, executive population, and restructuring plans. We have much work to do in building a clean and streamlined organisation, which we have started in earnest and has remained an area of focus for me during Q3. Our goal is to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies and increase accountability at every level of the company. As mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we need to right size and scale back the company while ensuring that we are retaining our best internal talents and hiring the best external talents from industry and universities. During Q2, we completed the majority of the actions needed to achieve our year end target of 75,000 employees.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThese were hard but necessary decisions, and we reduced management layers by approximately 50% in the process. We are on track to implement our return to office mandate starting September. These actions are necessary not just to reduce our operating expenses, but to make the company more agile, collaborative, and vibrant to simplify our business and improve our product and process execution. Next, on our foundry strategy. I continue to believe that our heritage and expertise in semiconductor technology development and manufacturing remains a very valuable and vital asset.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI also fully appreciate the strategic importance of The US domicile semiconductor manufacturing. Transforming this unique asset into a robust foundry business requires us to take a systematic approach and act from the position of strength. The foundry business is a service business that relies on foundational principle of trust. We need to demonstrate to our customers that we can deliver wafers on time with high quality, reliability, and yield that we can manufacture their products at scale. We need to have process and packaging technology that is not only competitive, but more importantly, is designed to meet the needs of our customers.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nIn addition, we also need to develop a rich and diverse ecosystem of IP and EDA partners who will enable our customer to seamlessly design chips using our process. And finally, perhaps most importantly, we need to build capacity smartly and carefully on a schedule that meets the needs of our customers and supports the economics of our business. This approach is fundamentally different than the path we have been on for the last four years. Unfortunately, the capacity investment we make over the last several years were well ahead of demand and were unwise and excessive. Our factory footprint has become needlessly fragmented.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nGoing forward, we will grow our capacity based solely on the volume commitments and deploy CapEx lockstep with the tangible milestones and not before. As part of this new financial discipline, we have decided not to continue with our manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland. We also plan to consolidate our assembly and test operation in Costa Rica into larger existing sites in Vietnam and Malaysia. And we will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio to ensure our spending is aligned with market demand. Importantly, based on the progress we have already made in Ohio, we have flexibility to accelerate work as needed to meet customer needs.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nTurning specifically to process technology development, on Intel 18A, we will continue to make steady progress on our yield and performance targets. Intel 18A is the foundation of at least next three generations of Intel client and server products. And we remain committed to ramping this technology to scale. Intel 18A and Intel 18AP are critical nodes for Intel products and will drive meaningful wafer volumes well into the next decade. Our foundry and products teams remain focused on enabling Penta Lake to launch this year.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nOnce we get our own product ramping in high volume, we will be in better position to attract external customers to this technology. The Intel 18A family is also important as we continue to advance our work for the US government within the Secure Engrave programs, as well as for other initial committed customers. On Intel 14A, the Foundry Technology team is continuing to focus on the basic building blocks, technology definitions and transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, PDKs, foundational IPs, and test chips to validate and improve performance and defect density. Designing 14A at its inception as a foundry node from the ground up, better positions us to meet specific customer requirements and address a broadened segment of the market. This work is being driven and informed by direct input from large external customers and from our own internal product teams.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nA key aspect of prudently pursuing our foundry ambition is also making sure we maintain sensible optionality for our internal product teams. They will continue to work closely with both internal and external foundry partners. They will do their homework and make process and supplier decisions based on what is best for our end customers against criteria of performance, cost, yield and time to market. Our external foundry strategy has always been rooted in the economic reality of semiconductor manufacturing. Up to and through Intel 18A, we could generate a reasonable return on our investments with only Intel products.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThe increase in capital costs at Intel 14A make it clear that we need both Intel products and a meaningful external customer to drive acceptable returns on our deployed capital. And I will only invest when I'm confident those returns exit. I'm intimately familiar with the Foundry and Fabulous ecosystem. Having helped create it over the last two decades, I'm using that experience to put our Intel foundry on a more solid footing for the future. I will do so while being prudent with our capital, and ensure we can deliver attractive returns on the investment we make.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come. Under my leadership, we will build what customers need, when they need it, and earn their trust to consistent execution. Next, onto our core x86 franchise. In client, our top priority is delivering our first pentaLake SKU by year end, followed by additional SKUs in the first half of twenty twenty six. The successful launch of the Penta Lake will solidify our strong share in the notebook market across consumer and enterprise.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nWe still have gaps to close in the high end desktop market, but I'm encouraged by our unmatched go to market reach, our x86 ecosystem, and the progress we are making on NovaLake due out at the end of twenty twenty six. In traditional service, we continue to have solid position in AI host nodes and storage, where our single threaded performance has been optimized for those workloads. Granite Rapids is ramping as planned, and we continue to see good demand for our more established server products. But sustainable share improvement in this market will take time. Specifically, we need to improve in broader hyperscale workloads where performance per watt is key differentiator.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI have also taken steps to correct past mistakes regarding multithreading capabilities on our PCORs. I'm also making progress on bringing in new leadership in our data center business and look forward to being able to announce these changes next quarter. Longer term, my directive to our silicon and platform teams is to define products with clean and simple architecture, better cost structure to simplify our SKU stack, all while enable a path to robust product margin. I'm also instituting a policy where every major chip design needs to be personally reviewed and approved by me before tape out. I have already begun this process.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThis discipline will improve our execution speed and move up towards a first time bright mindset while also saving development costs. Finally, turning to AI. In the past, we approached AI with a traditional silicon and training centric mindset. Without a cohesive silicon systems software stack and strategy. While we do need to build and consolidate upon our silicon franchise based upon our x86 CPU and our XE GPUs.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nWe recognize the need to move up the abstraction stack into system and software. This is the area where Intel has traditionally been weak or entirely absent. But we intend to incubate and grow these important skill sets and capabilities under my leadership. This will take time, but it will be vital for Intel to stay relevant in the next wave of computing. In addition, we see the AI market continuing to evolve, and we are concentrating our effort on areas we believe we can disrupt and differentiate like inference and agentic AI.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nWe need to start by first understanding emerging and real AI workloads. Then work backwards to design software, systems, and silicon to enable best outcome for those particular workloads. We will strive to become the compute platform of choice. But we will also work towards a full stack AI solution, and I look forward to sharing more on our strategy in the coming months. Underpinning all of these efforts is a strong focus on improving our balance sheet.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nWe continue to maintain solid liquidity, but despite meaningful capital spending offsets. Our last full fiscal year of positive adjusted free cash flow was 2021. This is completely unacceptable. How we allocate our owners' capital and the return we generate for them are of paramount importance to me. We have several major levers to generate better cash flow, including driving operating leverage and managing our capital outlays.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI discussed earlier the actions we have taken to reduce operating expenses and improve execution. I am very confident in our ability to hit our operating expenses targets for 2025 and 2026, respectively. We have already lowered our CapEx guidance from the beginning of the year by roughly $5,000,000,000 year to date, while purchasing commitments make further reductions in 2025 difficult. We will continue to work to reduce capital spending in 2026. Lastly, as it relates to our non core assets, We successfully monetized a portion of our ownership of MobileIce earlier this month, and we look forward to closing the Ultera transaction with Silver Lake this quarter.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI will evaluate other opportunities as we continue to sharpen our focus around our core business and strategy. I believe the actions we have taken during my first few months are steering us in the right direction. That said, I also know that turning the company around will take time and require patience. We have a lot to fix in order to move the company forward. And I'm determined to drive the changes necessary to improve our performance.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI am equally that as we execute, we will rebuild this company and have a bright future. I will now turn it over to Dave to go into more detail on the financials.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThank you, Lip Bu.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nI'll start by characterizing the prevailing market conditions in Q2. On our Q1 earnings call, we signaled the economic landscape had become increasingly uncertain driven by shifting trade policies, persistent inflation concerns, and increased regulatory risk. Fortunately, markets largely function normally in q two, enabling the fundamental demand drivers underpinning our core markets to manifest. In client, we saw continued solid demand driven by the end of service for Windows 10 and the aging COVID era installed base. In addition, AIPCs continued to grow as a percentage of our mix.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOn the traditional server side, we saw hyperscalers and enterprises continue to refresh their CPU installed base to take advantage of our newer products with better performance within a lower power envelope. Both dynamics underscore the durable demand within our two largest markets and the enduring strength of the x 86 ecosystem. Second quarter revenue was $12,900,000,000 coming in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by strength across client and data center. Similar to comments we made in Q4 and Q1, we think it's likely Q2 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior to mitigate tariff uncertainty, although it continues to be difficult to quantify. Turning to non GAAP gross margins and EPS, last quarter we indicated that incremental costs associated with our spending reduction plan would likely impact non GAAP gross margin, but since those costs were not yet calculated, they were not included in our Q2 gross margin and EPS guidance of 36.5% and breakeven respectively.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAs such, we recognized approximately $800,000,000 of non cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges related to excess prior generation tools for which we couldn't find reuse and approximately $200,000,000 of one time period costs. These charges resulted in Q2 gross margin of 29.7 and EPS of minus 10¢. Excluding these charges, our second quarter non GAAP gross margin would have been 37.5% and non GAAP EPS would have been $0.10 both results ahead of our Q2 guidance. Beyond those costs, we also were impacted by $1,900,000,000 of charges that are excluded from our non GAAP results. The large majority of those charges are associated with the severance for our headcount reduction aligned with our restructuring plan.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWe expect the principal cash cost associated with the restructuring charges to land in Q3 twenty five. While difficult, these decisions have us firmly on track to meet our calendar year 2025 and calendar year 2026 OpEx targets of $17,000,000,000 and $16,000,000,000 respectively. Q2 operating cash flow was $2,100,000,000 with gross CapEx of $4,500,000,000 in the quarter and net CapEx of $3,100,000,000 resulting in adjusted free cash flow of negative $1,100,000,000 We have $21,200,000,000 of cash and short term investments and remain focused on beginning the process of delevering this year as cash from operations continues to improve. Moving to segment results for q two, Intel products revenue was $11,800,000,000, up slightly sequentially and above our expectations across client and server. I was pleased by the team's ability to support revenue upside in the quarter as capacity for Intel seven remains very tight.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nCCG revenue was up 3% quarter over quarter and above our expectation with continued PC refresh demand and upside in hedge deployments. Within the quarter, CCG launched a number of AI PCs with key OEM partners, announced the expansion of its ARC GPUs for AI use cases tailored to inference and professional workstations, and made its open edge platform code available to the developer community, all in support of the growing opportunity for us to compete as AI inference moves to the edge. DCAI revenue was down 5% sequentially, but above expectations driven by variability in hyperscale demand, partially offset by continued strength in host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute. In addition, we saw upside to plan on the continued ramp of Xeon six codenamed Granite Rapids. In q two, DCAI launched three new Xeon six processors with priority core turbo technology to boost AI workloads.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOne of these Xeon six SKUs was selected as the host node for NVIDIA DGX b 300 AI accelerated systems, and the Imperial College London chose Xeon six to power its latest HPC supercomputer demonstrating Xeon remains the CPO of choice for AI workloads. Operating profit for Intel products was $2,700,000,000, 23% of revenue, and down $250,000,000 quarter over quarter, principally driven by the period costs I highlighted earlier. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4,400,000,000, down 5% sequentially and above expectations on better than forecasted output of Intel seven wafers and increased advanced packaging services. In q two, eighteen a reached milestone with the start of production wafers in Arizona ahead of Intel products q four launch of its next generation client product codenamed Panther Lake. Intel Foundry released an early version of Intel 14 a's PDK to lead external customers and at Direct Connect in April announced an EMIB advanced packaging partnership with Amcor.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nIntel Foundry operating loss in q two was $3,200,000,000, down $848,000,000 sequentially, materially driven by the $800,000,000 impairment charges I discussed earlier. Turning to All Other, revenue came in at $1,100,000,000 and was up 12% sequentially and above expectations. The three primary components of all other are Mobileye, Ultera, and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $69,000,000 of operating profit. Now turning to guidance.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nHistorically, sequential growth in Q3 has been up high single digits. However, we've seen three quarters of revenue growth above our expectations, which we attribute, at least in part, to customers hedging against tariff uncertainty. As such, while we believe the underlying fundamentals of our core markets support growth, we feel it prudent to continue to plan for a below seasonal second half of twenty twenty five. As such, for q three, we're forecasting a revenue range of 12.6 to $13,600,000,000, down two to up 6% sequentially. Within Intel products, we expect more strength in CCG.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWe expect Intel foundry revenue down slightly quarter over quarter due to capacity constraints in Intel seven, which we expect to persist through the second half of the year and reduced expectations for external advanced packaging revenue. For all other, we expect revenue for the sum of those parts to be roughly flat sequentially. At the midpoint of $13,100,000,000 we expect a gross margin of approximately 36% on an increased mix of outsourced products, the early ramp of Panther Lake, and increased costs associated with tariffs. We forecast a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS all on a non GAAP basis. We're forecasting 2025 OpEx of $17,000,000,000 with a 2026 OpEx target of $16,000,000,000.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWe expect non controlled income or NCI to be approximately $250 to $300,000,000 in both Q3 and Q4 on a GAAP basis. NCI is still expected to grow meaningfully in fiscal year twenty twenty six. In Q2, we took tangible steps to increase focus on our core business while leveraging non core assets to shore up the balance sheet. We raised approximately $900,000,000 through the Mobileye offering, and we are on track to complete the stake sale of Altera in q three. Our guidance includes Altera for the full quarter, but we will deconsolidate at deal close.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOnce the deconsolidation is complete, we will recognize our remaining Altera investment within equity investments on the balance sheet. On the income statement, we will recognize our proportional share of Ultera's net income on a one quarter lag through gains and losses on equity investments net, which is excluded from our non GAAP results. As a result, it is likely our Q3 non GAAP results will reflect only a portion of the financial results for Ultera. Moving to CapEx. We anticipate 2025 gross capital investment will be approximately $18,000,000,000 and forecast 8,000,000,000 to $11,000,000,000 for net CapEx.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nBetter utilization of our construction in progress will allow us to deploy more overall CapEx in 2025 than in 2024, and we expect the improved utilization to continue in 2026, resulting in lower gross and net CapEx next year. Beginning the process of delevering our balance sheet in 2025 remains a top priority for us. I'll wrap up by saying Q2 operationally was the third consecutive solid quarter, reflecting our commitment to maintain a high say do ratio, closely manage what's in our control, and react quickly as the environment evolves. I have confidence that the strategic priorities we've established are the right ones, and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on them while acknowledging there are no quick fixes. With that, I'll turn over to John to start the Q and A.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q and A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Let me do the first one for you and thank you for walking through the strategic details that you're putting into place. It seems like fixing the foundry side is based on trust, as you said before, and trust seems to have its origin in fixing the x86 side of the business. So, I guess my question is how fast can you fix that?\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nI know you are having to sign off on every tape out, but is the trust that 18A can ramp dependent upon Nova Lake and Diamond Rapids? Are we talking 2027, 2028? What are the sort of steps we need to see to build that trust in your x86 business so that the Foundry business can ramp?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nRoss, thank you so much for a good question. First of all, we focus on the 18A. So far the last two months, and I have twice a week review with the team And we make steady progress on our technology towards the yield, performance target and reliability. So I think as you mentioned, 18A is the foundation for at least three generation of our Intel client and server business products. And we are committed to ramp that.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd so far, you know, the give me the confidence is we're engaging with external ecosystem partners to help us to look at the yield and how can we improve. And that in the past we didn't engage that. So I really see that, you know, the feedback from the partners that say, hey, the culture, that intensity for our team is really focused on the yield performance and that really like the attitude on that. So, so far, I think give me a lot of confidence that we can launch our Pantalik SKU by the end of the year. And also I think the external customer include secure and create with the US government.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd then with a sufficient internal volume and ensure the good progress, then we can have a better attraction to our external customer. So I think this is a process to kind of build the trust with the customer. They can count on us on the reliability, the yield, and we can deliver on time, on scale to really supporting them. And then they're going to just put the resources on their revenue based on our foundry. So there's a lot of responsibility for us to deliver with high quality.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThat's something that I feel very committed and we like what I see, it gave me a lot of more confidence. Ross, do you have a follow-up question, please?\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nI do. One potentially a little near term for Dave on the gross margin side. You mentioned that the gross margin was guided down a bit sequentially for a couple of different reasons. Can you dive a little deeply into a little more deeply into those and perhaps more importantly, just what do you see as the tailwinds and headwinds to gross margin as we look say, into next year? I know you're not going to guide it specifically, but just some of the puts and takes would be great. Thank you.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYeah, okay. Thanks, Russ. Yeah, let's just delve into the gross margins for the third quarter. I'd say the predominant driver of the lower gross margins in the third quarter is Lunar Lake. We expect a pretty significant ramp in Lunar Lake in the third quarter.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd I've made this comment, I think, multiple times on calls, but it's got the memory in the package. And so we kind of pass it on at the same cost we bought it, and that really has a negative impact on way the gross margins look optically. And so as we mix higher to Lunar Lake, that's obviously going to be a headwind to us in terms of gross margins as expected, but perhaps having a little bit more of a significant transition from 2Q to 3Q. We thought we'd have probably more volume in 2Q. The second big driver of gross margins is the ramp that Lip just talked about of Panther Lake.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nObviously, we're in the early stages of the maturity of Panther Lake, so the cost per wafer is going to be higher, and so that is going to drive some headwinds. Obviously, as Lip Bu said, yields improve, more importantly volumes increase, that reduces the cost. And so that will transition to a tailwind ultimately. I think next year, the big benefit for us is this significant ramp in Panther Lake, given that we're bringing a fair amount of wafers back inside, so that drives a lower cost and we get a better cost structure of Panther Lake showing up with the higher volumes, that's clearly going to be beneficial to us in terms of gross margin. That said, a lot of this will be determined on mix and we'll have to see how things play out through next year in terms of the mix.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThe last thing I'd say, and maybe this is maybe even a little bit more longer term than you asked the question, Ross, is the way we think about Foundry, we ramp more leading edge nodes, that is going to be a benefit to us in terms of gross margins. We think Foundry gross margins will expand next year and that will be a continuing story out for several years. The other side of things is the product side. And I think there are three levers to products. One is pricing.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nAnd as Lip said, he's really focused on bringing out products that customers really value. And as that becomes a reality, it'll show up in the pricing that will help us on gross margin. The second is the cost structure and Lip Bu is also really focusing on cleaner designs, simpler designs, driving more efficient use of silicon and so forth. So, as we get better cost structure as well over time, and there are products on the roadmap that already have it, even as POR will see improvement in gross margins. And then in the near term, while all this is going on, I'm looking at all the other extraneous things that drive cost of sales, how many samples we do, how we run the fabs and so forth and driving improvements there to position us for better gross margins.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nRoss, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Lupu, I wanted to ask about the Foundry strategy. You did add a bunch of risk factors and language on 14a that kind of seems to leave the door open to kind of walking away from its development. And I know you did talk about some of that, but if I'm an outside customer and I'm looking at your roadmap and I see this hedging on 14a, would I engage? I guess, how do you sort of marry the hedging on 14A development with trying to build an external foundry business?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nI guess, I kind of read it as maybe a hard pivot away from foundry and doing what's right for the product business, but can you sort of talk about that?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, very good question. So I think on the 14A, you know, first of all, I think the team is laser focused on building up the basic building blocks, technology, definition, transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, PDK, and foundation IP and the test chip to verify and improve the performance and the defect density. Saying that, you know, clearly we learned quite a lot on the mistake we make on the 18A And now we applying to the 14A. So I think we learned a lot. And secondly, we also reach out to the outside partners to helping us with showing them the data and how can we improve the yield and per month, and so that we can drive that, give me a lot of confidence we can get there.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nBut even more important, we're engaging with customers. They're going to enable us and then with clear milestone to execute in terms of process development and with PDK, with all the different IP that we need to really put it together. So I think that gave me a lot of more confidence that this time we have customer engaging early enough in the inception, and also we learn from our mistakes, and we can learn quicker and then get a better result. So I think all in all, I think I keep a lot more confident that team is laser focused, and the feedback from the partners in the outside is that, wow, the culture is changing. And you guys are really focused on the yield rather than just the performance.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nSo I think that part I think will be able to enable us. Plus the other part is we really engage with all the external EDA and IP provider, make sure that we have the whole program together to do the pattern matching for the customer. And the good news is customer are excited. The 14A is a process node, but clearly I will make sure that until I see the internal customer, external customer volume commitment before I put CapEx into their operation. So that is something that you have to meet my requirement in terms of performance and yield.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYou know, it's a lot of responsibility to be serving our customer, make sure that we can deliver the result, consistent reliable result to them so that their revenue can depend on us. Tim, do have a quick follow-up question?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nI do, yeah, yeah. I guess I just kind of wonder like how an external customer would continue to be engaged. Question really is for Dave. So Dave, you talked about CapEx coming down next year. What is maintenance CapEx?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nLike, much can you cut CapEx next year? Could you take like $5,000,000,000 out of gross CapEx next year? If you can give some sense on that. Thanks.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYeah, okay, good question. Let me unpack it a little bit. Would say why CapEx can come down next year is we bought a lot over the last few years, quite honestly, and we have to digest that and that enables us to deploy more capital than we have to spend, which I guess is a good thing at this point. So that's what's driving the fundamental view that we should be down in CapEx. It's not really moving it to maintenance CapEx, would say. But to kind of ballpark a number, I'd say probably half our CapEx is main, but our normalized CapEx call it at this $18,000,000,000 level for this year is probably what you consider sustaining or maintenance CapEx.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThank you. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thank you. You mentioned again the Intel seven being in short supply through the end of the calendar year. Can you talk about, you know, what's driving that? Is there are you gonna be able to drive more volume to the Intel four products?\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nAnd what, do you have to add wafer starts in Intel? So I'm just kinda curious what's going on with that.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYeah, I mean, Raptor Lake is doing really well. I mean, that's the biggest driver of it. That's why, back to my comments around Lunar Lake ramping next quarter, what we're really seeing a lot of strength in is Ramper Lake right now. I think the price points of Raptor Lake are, I think, where a lot of consumers and enterprises are buying PCs, and so that's what's kind of pulling it in. But I do suspect that we'll see mixes change.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYou you mentioned Intel 4.3, you know, Meter Lake, and of course, we are ramping and are in the process of ramping Granite Rapids, which will drive more volume of Intel 4.3. So we're already building out the capacity and wafer routes in that area.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nDo have a follow-up question?\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nYeah, I do. Coming back to the CapEx, I mean, you still have the large amount of construction in progress that hasn't yet been productively employed. Are you going to be able to get full value out of that? I know there was a shelf first strategy. Is it going to continue to persist that there's a large amount of that? Or will you start depreciating that at some point?\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYeah, there was a big chunk of it that was Arizona, actually. And we actually flipped that at the beginning of this quarter. So that's obviously already ramping on ET and A. So we actually saw it come in, think it was north of 50 at the end of 2Q, 50,000,000,000. And I think we're at this point now down into the kind of mid to high 30s.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo we've made a significant move in the right direction. Construction products or assets under construction is a mix of equipment and buildings, so the other thing that we're doing is trying to use more of that, so that will also bring the number down. So we should have a steady improvement in that number through the rest of this year, and the goal is to kind of drive it down further next year. That said, we are going to want to continue to have optionality on fab white space, and that's while we are slowing down Ohio, we're not stopping Ohio. So we're going to continue to make investments and there will be assets under construction or construction in progress on our balance sheet to make sure we have flexibility as the demand drivers change.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzis from Melius.\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (MD &amp; Head - Technology Research)\nHey guys, thanks for the question. Wanted to ask about servers. I may have missed it, but what's the trend you're expecting into the third quarter? And what are your thoughts about share losses there and when perhaps those dissipate a bit into the following year?\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nWe're not giving out the guidance by business unit. We're roughly up a little bit. We'll have to see how things play out between servers and CPUs. As far as share goes, obviously we're not where we want to be in terms of a competitive portfolio and that's what Lithu is really focused on improving. That said, Granite Rapids is a better part, Diamond Rapids, the next part will be a better part.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo we think we continually improve our relative competitive position, but to really be where we want to be still takes some work. And so I think the great thing about it is we actually have held share relatively well despite our position in the market in terms of performance. And I think it's a good testament to the x86 ecosystem and the strength of that and our particular capabilities in the x86 system in terms of the ecosystem that we provide to our customers.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nDoug, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Ben Reitzes** (MD &amp; Head - Technology Research)\nYeah, I was wondering if Lip Bu would mind expanding on his commentary around the AI strategy. Obviously, you're going to be updating that at some point, if you don't mind clarifying when that will be. What do you are you inferring that you have a GPU centric strategy or something else? And how should we be thinking about how you're going to attack that market? Thanks.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, very good question. So I think we're going to unfold our AI strategy in the months to come. But let me just share with you, I think we're going to look at it from where are we going to target and focus. And, you know, first of all, it's the inference side and also the agentic AI, and that is really taking off, and we want to provide that interception on that. And then we're going to take a different approach.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nWe're to look at the whole system software to the silicon and then drive the performance. Agentic AI is very important, is the accuracy and speed. So I think with all this AI, compute is going to be even more intensive. But the workload is a little bit different. So we want to look at how can we intercept using our franchise of A86 and then with the accelerator and then somehow drive that whole become the compute platform of the future.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd so those are the things that were in the drawing board. We are working on it. And then we will share with you when we are ready. And so far, the engagement with customer, they love what we are. And basically, we have to put the team.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd we are delighted we add on a few team members to come on board. And also, we're going to focus on adding more software talents so in a way that we can really drive some of this opportunity and be a player in this opportunity.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of William Stein from Tru Securities. Your question please.\n\n**William Stein** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst)\nGreat, thank you for taking my question. Lip Bu, I'd also like to lean into this AI topic a little bit because I think you might not have used the words full stack but that's certainly what it sounds like. So when I think about the opportunity that Intel has, I guess I've thought of it as do you want to be sort of like NVIDIA but NVIDIA already has a very established position. You have cloud service providers doing ASICs and you have AMD trying to do the same thing. So it sounds almost like you're aiming to be the third or arguably the fourth supplier in a market where there's really only two successful and so far Nvidia and some of its customers.\n\n**William Stein** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst)\nAnd I wonder to what degree you have considered or are still considering another approach like doing ASICs to establish a better position in this market. I hope that question makes sense, but any clarification and education you could provide us would help a lot. Thank you.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, very good question. Thank you. And then first of all, I think you are correct in what I described about the system software is a full stack solution we try to provide. And then clearly we are behind and we had tried to find the area that we can really wage in and then drive a different solution and service. And I think meanwhile, want to play into our strength in the '86 so that we can really playing that whole orchestrating what is the workload and then how do we optimize that.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd then the other part is also important, look at some of the new architecture. And that's why I am embracing some of the startup and some of the incubating idea so that we can bring that in. Back to your another question that you have is the ASIC. So we are also very open working with the system company providing the AI platform that it can be a purpose built and so that really drive their performance. So absolutely, we're going to drive that opportunity. Will, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**William Stein** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst)\nYeah. I'd like to maybe just ask about the write downs in the quarter. It sounds like that was equipment, but I wonder if there was any inventory in that as well, and maybe any clarification on what you're writing down to the degree you think it would help us? Thank you.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nOkay, yeah. We did have inventory write downs, but we weren't isolating that. That's just part of the normal cost of sales roll up. This particular write down that we're isolating mostly was around impairments of equipment. And then there was another couple $100,000,000 that was kind of an adjustment in terms of how we take some certain extraneous costs originally through inventory and now moving it more to a period cost.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nThe equipment, it was kind of a bunch of different things, but I would say I'll give you one of the bigger ones that was an example. We had some tools that we had bought. They were sitting in assets under construction. Relatively had tools in the line that were older tools, and we took the opportunity since we had an excess amount, is we took the newer tools, put them in line, took the older tools out. They had a higher net book value than the value we can get in the open marketplace if we sell them.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo we wrote them down to that value and they'll be held and assets held for sale. So it was things of that nature. Like I said, mostly older tools that we just couldn't find a purpose for.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThanks Will. Jonathan, can we have the next question?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, our next question comes from the line of Stacy Raskin from Bernstein Research. Your question please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one, I wanted to touch on eighteen a and fourteen a. So you said eighteen a would be supplying the next three generations of Intel products. So I guess that's 2026, '27, and '28.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst)\nSo I guess that would suggest 14, if it comes out, be 2029 at the earliest. I I I guess, number one, is that timing correct? And then, you know, just within that, given the plans, you know, at least the the contingency plans to maybe not do 14 a, I mean, I guess, this suggested if 14 a dies, does the foundry strategy die with it? And can you run a sustainable business just on internal volume with 18A and increasing outsource if 14A doesn't do what it needs to do?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nStacy, it's a good question. So first of all, I think the as I mentioned earlier, 18A is important to us for the three generation of internal product. And then when we're ready, then we can go outside with more confident to get a customer to support us. And then on the 14A, same as the A14 from TSMC, the timing is all in the 28, 29. So that's no different, no change.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd clearly, we're laser focused on the process technology with the two engaging customer and with clear milestone to deliver. And then clearly, think we're going to learn a lot and then we're not going to put any CapEx until we see the yield performance and also our internal customer and external customer feedback and the volume commitment, then we will put the CapEx in. And so the perception will be very clear. We are committed to the foundry business. And then meanwhile, we're going to be very disciplined in our CapEx deployment, make sure that we see the volume, see the customer commitment, then we deploy.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nMaybe I'll just add one more thing. If I understood the last question, can you still do AT and A, I think is what you said. We actually won't get to peak volumes on AT and A until probably the beginning of the next decade. So this is going be a node that we use for a very long time and we're expecting a really good ROI on it. We largely calculating that based on the internal uses for it, given that most of that is coming internally in the near term.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nI would say I wouldn't write off 18A as potentially getting external customers at some point. Clearly, we probably won't get a lot in wave one as it seems, but there will be multiple waves and 18A will find different use cases over time and there'll be more opportunities for us to attract external customers after we do so much improvement in terms of performance and yield on our own products.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nStacy, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst)\nI I do. Thanks. I wanna ask about the the CapEx. So you talked about sustaining CapEx at, like, 50% of the current level, which would be, like, like, 9,000,000,000, I guess. Mhmm.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (MD &amp; Senior Analyst)\nShould I be thinking about that as a plausible scenario for next year? I mean, if if I take the current, like, run rate for this year, like, the gross CapEx in the first half and 18,000,000,000 for the year, it suggests, a quarterly run rate of, I don't know, 3,600,000,000.0 be something like 14, 14 and a half billion for the year. Or, like, I guess I'm trying to figure out, like, what's a plausible number for where you might land next year given what you see. Is 9,000,000,000 actually on the table, is it closer to 14? Or, like, what do you guys actually have in mind?\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYeah. Fair question, Stacy. I was given, like, a ballpark. You know, what would be just you know, we weren't, like, moving forward with something. But, we're gonna need our assets under construction will not be enough to support all our CapEx investments even with maintenance CapEx next year.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nSo we haven't quite figured out exactly yet what the plan will look like for next year. We don't lock in our CapEx until early in the year. So that would be, call it sometime in the January timeframe of '26 that will lock in twenty six's CapEx. But I think it's meaningfully higher than $9,000,000,000 but certainly we think it's going to be less than 18.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThanks, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThanks. For my first quest first question, I wanted to discuss competition in the server CPU market. I see in your 10 Q, you mentioned server ASPs are down 8% from last year because of a competitive environment. I thought that, you know, rising cores would mean greater ASP, so just if you could address that. But then, kind of more medium to longer term, Lip Bu, how impactful is competition from ARM who is claiming to take over half the server market?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, good question. So I think let me just look at the server market. You know, clearly, you know, we still have about, you know, 55% market share. And clearly we have some mistake we make on the high end performing server area. And one thing is this called synchronized multithreading.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd I think used to be Intel strength, but somehow we overlook it. And then now we are double down, make sure that we will have that performance gap we can narrow. And then meanwhile, we also engaging with some of the big hyperscale and also high end enterprise. We learn what are the workload they require and we laser focus on getting the product roadmap clear and simplify and make it easier to work with us. And so I think we take all the steps, we listen to customer.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nOne thing that I think we change, we listen to customer very closely and then engaging with them early in the product development and defenation stage, and they love it. And so I think we have a chance to regain back and then with the new products so that we can really drive the success here. Vic, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nYes. Thank you. Maybe one for Dave on gross margins. So Dave, let's say if your sales grow mid single digit next year, hypothetically, what will gross margins do when you look at all the puts and takes around the mix of AT and A and and what you need to outsource? I know you're not giving specific outlook, but let's say your top line growth, is there a simple formula to look at the gross margins versus the 36% level that you are at right now? Thank you.\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nObviously, the devil's in the details on this, but I think a good rule of thumb is that we get somewhere in the 40% to 60% fall through next year, hopefully closer to the higher end of that if things work out in our favor.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nThank you. Jonathan, we have time for one last question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the server discussion as well. I know in the past, you guys have talked about the progression of 18A and Clearwater Forest, which I can appreciate the lower volume SKU. But I'm curious as you think about stabilizing your market share and maybe being able to recapture share, do you think that that's a function of Diamond Rapids?\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nAnd if so, can we at all think about the timing of Diamond Rapids as 2026, second half of 'twenty six? Any clarity on that would be helpful.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYes. I think that's a good question. I think clearly, are looking at review our roadmap. And then you mentioned about Clearwater Forest, then the Diamond Rapids. And clearly, think the timeframe is plus and minus six months. And I think overall, I think we are pretty much focused on that. And the next generation are the coral rabbits. And clearly, we're going to review the whole coral market. And that will be in the 'twenty eight, 'twenty nine.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAnd we make sure that we have the robust products to come out. So I think it's going to be fine tuned and discuss with the customer, get the validation from the customer. And then so far, I think we are, now we can also have a new leader and need some changes I'm making. And then clearly, think we're going to drive that whole data center. It's a very important business for us. We're going to become competitive again.\n\n**John Pitzer** (Corporate Vice President of Corporate Planning &amp; Investor Relations)\nSarah, do have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nYeah, I do. Thanks, John. So real quickly, just Dave, I want to go back like the skip or the Arizona and the Ireland fabs. Just remind us again how we should be modeling that. I think in the past you talked about a 500,000,000 headwind this year and then that going to like 1,300,000,000.0 to $1,500,000,000 next year and significantly higher in 2027.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director &amp; Technology Analyst)\nSo any kind of updates? Should we still think about that? Is that increasing? Just any color?\n\n**David Zinsner** (EVP &amp; CFO)\nYeah. Those are roughly the right numbers to forecast. Obviously, as we get out into the twenty seventwenty eight timeframe, we're kind of hitting the normalized run rates of these skips. So it'll be higher than the 1.2 to 1.3. We'll update you as we progress.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThank you all for joining us today. I must say I have been pleased with the teams and the progress we have made transitioning to a financially disciplined foundry, resetting how we engage with our customer and our partners and simplify our operations. I look forward to discuss our continued progress with you next quarter. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nFor standing by, and welcome to the Intel Corporation's First Quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. Now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, and our CFO, David Zinsner. Lip-Bu will open with comments on our first quarter results, as well as some initial observations, priorities, and actions that he is driving. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including second quarter guidance. We will then transition to answer your questions. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nIt also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release and most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate, to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Lip-Bu.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThank you, John, and let me add my welcome. I joined Intel five weeks ago. The reason I'm here is simple: I love our company. I saw the challenges we were facing, and I could not sit on the sidelines knowing I had the opportunity to turn things around and put us back on the path to gain market share and drive sustainable growth. Q1 was a step in the right direction. Driven by Dave's and Michelle's leadership, we delivered revenue, gross margins, and EPS above our guidance. I want to thank them both, as well as our teams, for the good execution, especially with the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Our goal now is to build on this progress, but it won't be easy. There are many areas we need to improve, and there's no quick fixes. We must remain laser-focused on execution.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nOne of my biggest learnings so far is that we need to fundamentally transform our culture and the way in which we operate. Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made. New ideas and people who generate them have not been given the room or resources to incubate and grow. The unnecessary silos have led to bad execution. I'm here to fix this. I'm taking swift actions to simplify the way we do business and drive transparency and accountability across the company. We will empower smaller teams to move faster and make better decisions, and we will significantly reduce the number of layers that get in their way. As a first step, I have flattened the structure of my leadership team.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nAll critical product, manufacturing, and G&A functions, which were spread over two to three layers, are now directly reporting to me. This will allow me to get closer to our product and engineering groups and work directly with them to close the gaps with competition more quickly. I will apply the same streamlining approach across the company with a focus on empowering our engineering talents to create great products and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. To accelerate this simplification, we are taking more costs out of the business. The lower our calendar 2025 and calendar 2026 OPEX targets. We now expect OPEX of $17 billion this year and $16 billion next year.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nIn addition, as we continue to identify ways to operate our manufacturing network more efficiently, I have directed our teams to find an additional $2 billion of savings in our gross CapEx, taking our target for this year to $18 billion. We will continue to take a closer look at our existing factory footprint to ensure that we are making the most efficient use of our in-store capacity before committing to any additional spending. I will continue to make the needed investment to reignite innovation even as we reduce our overall expenses by minimizing projects and programs that have been taking attention away from our core client and server business.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThey will include revitalizing our engineering core. I'm rebuilding our engineering talent pool with urgency by promoting strong leaders internally, bringing back critical lost talent, and recruiting new people. In addition, we are mandating a four-day-per-week return-to-office policy, effective Q3 2025. I know firsthand the power of teamwork, and this action is necessary to reinstill a more collaborative working environment, improving efficiency and boosting innovation. By eliminating inefficiencies and transforming how we do business, I strongly believe we can reduce our costs while securing our future. Many of you have asked about my longer-term strategy plan. It is an appropriate question. It's a little bit too soon for me to provide all the details, but let me share with you my priorities.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nFirst, the best products always win, and it is very important that we refocus our core franchise to start building best-in-class products again. We have a good foundation. Our ecosystem in client and data center computing is valuable and durable, and we still maintain a large market share in both. My focus will be ensuring that our team builds products that are highly competitive and meet the needs of our customers as we enter a new era of computing defined by AI agents and reasoning models.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nTo achieve this, we are taking a holistic approach to redefine our portfolio to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads. We are making necessary adjustments to our product roadmap so that we are positioned to make the best-in-class products while staying laser-focused on execution and ensuring on-time delivery. However, I want to emphasize that this is not a quick fix here. These changes will take time. Our goal is to become the platform of choice for our customers. This requires us to radically evolve our design and engineering mindset and anticipate the needs of our customers well in advance.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI have received direct feedback from many of our largest customers who are also close personal friends. I'm taking this feedback to heart and using it to inform and change our approach to product and platform design. Second, we need to refine our AI strategy with a focus on emerging areas of interest. My experience helping successfully fund and incubate many startups in this space provides unique insights that we will leverage in these funds. Our goal will be to take an integrated system and platform view to develop full-stack AI solutions that enable more accuracy, power efficiency, and security for our enterprise customers. Our goal will be to enable the next wave of computing defined by reasoning models, agentic AI, and physical AI.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nThird, we need to build trust with foundry customers. We have a lot of important building blocks in place, including the ramp of Intel 18A in the second half of 2025 to support the launch of our first Panther Lake SKU by year-end, with additional SKUs coming in the first half of 2026. However, I know from my years at Cadence Design that success in foundry business requires more than process technology manufacturing capabilities alone. It is first and foremost a customer service business built on a foundational principle of trust, and we need to instill a customer service mindset across our foundry business. Success in foundry relies on recognizing that each customer uses different design tools, methodologies, and styles. As a foundry, we need to ensure that our process technologies can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with a unique way of building their products.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nTo do this, we are more rapidly embracing industry-standard EDA tools and best design practices. Here again, there's no quick fix, but we will make the necessary changes to our roadmap to deliver on the commitments we make to our foundry customers. We must learn to delight our customers by building wafers that meet their required power, performance area, cost, quality, yield, reliability, and on-time schedule. While we are currently focused on delivering Intel 18A, we are also working closely with customers to define the critical KPIs to ensure online delivery of Intel 14A. Lastly, we need to strengthen our balance sheet. Our business is capital-intensive, and we have important investments to make at a time when our financial performance is not where it needs to be. This means we need to be prudent with capital.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nIn addition to new targets of OPEX, CapEx, we will also look to further monetize non-core assets. I'm very pleased to have Silver Lake as an investor in Alterra and welcome on board Raghib to help drive the business to its potential. In addition, we have made the decision not to spin off Intel Capital, but to work with the team to monetize our existing portfolio while being more selective on new investments that support the strategy. We need to get our balance sheet healthy and start the process of deleveraging this year. As we are building the new Intel, you can expect us to stay humble, drive the necessary changes to delight our customers.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nMy promotion has always been to underpromise and overdeliver, and I will be not satisfied until we regain the trust of our customers, putting the company on a sustainable path of gaining shares and growing revenue, and delivering consistent returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Dave.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nThank you, Lip-Bu Tan. Our Q1 results mostly reflected our view entering the year that our two biggest markets were poised for growth. On the client side, the end of service for Windows 10, the expected growing adoption of AI PCs, and an aging installed base following the COVID-era refresh pointed to a PC TAM growing 3%-5%. Similarly, on the traditional server side, delayed infrastructure upgrades driven by the rapid adoption of AI servers in 2024 supported double-digit CPU core growth this year on a roughly flat units.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nMore recently, the economic landscape has become increasingly uncertain, driven by shifting trade policies, persistent inflation, and increased regulatory risk. While we have yet to see a meaningful change in customer buying patterns, we think it's prudent to manage the business with a level of conservatism going into the second half of the year. First-quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, coming in at the high end of our guidance range, driven by better-than-expected Xeon sales. Similar to Q4 2024, we believe Q1 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior in anticipation of potential tariffs, though it is difficult to quantify the magnitude. Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.2%, approximately three percentage points above our guidance on much stronger-than-expected demand for Raptor Lake, combined with improved costs for Meteor Lake.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWhile we continue to see the mix of AI PCs growing throughout the year, the rate of growth off a lower-than-expected Q1 will be lower. We delivered first-quarter earnings per share of $0.13 versus our guidance of break-even EPS, driven by higher revenue, stronger gross margin, and lower operating expenses. I was particularly pleased to see our spending down $400 million sequentially and $700 million year-over-year as we continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure. Q1 operating cash flow was $800 million. We had gross CapEx of $6.2 billion, with offsets of $1.7 billion in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $3.7 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $21 billion and received $1.1 billion from CHIPS grants and $1.9 billion for the final close of our NAND business sale to SK Hynix.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nMoving to segment results for Q1, as previewed on our Q4 2024 earnings, we updated our segment reporting for Q1 2025. Details can be found in the appendix to our earnings deck and in our Q1 2025 10-Q. The following commentary reflects the updated segmentation and accompanying recasted 2024 financials. Intel products revenue was $11.8 billion, down 10% sequentially, but above our expectations. CCG revenue was down 13% quarter-over-quarter, below typical seasonality and in line with our expectation, with higher-than-expected volumes offset by product mix and competitive pressure. DCAI revenue was down 5% sequentially and above expectations, driven by hyperscaler demand for host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute. Operating profit for Intel products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue, and down $632 million quarter-over-quarter on lower revenue, partially offset by reduced operating expenses.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIntel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% sequentially on pull-ins of Intel 7 wafers and increased advanced packaging services. Intel Foundry operating loss in Q1 was $2.3 billion, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and in line with expectations. Structural cost improvements were offset by startup costs associated with the ramp of products on Intel 18A. Turning to All Other, revenue came in at $943 million and was down 15% sequentially, slightly above expectations. The three primary components of All Other are Mobileye, Alterra, and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $103 million of operating profit. As Lip-Bu stated, we announced on April 14 our intention to sell 51% of Alterra to Silver Lake Partners for an almost $9 billion valuation, with Intel receiving net cash proceeds of $4.4 billion.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe believe the value of our remaining 49% stake in Alterra will grow over time through our partnership with Silver Lake and with the addition of Raghib Hussain as the CEO. We expect this deal to close in the second half of 2025, at which point we expect to deconsolidate Alterra from our financial results. Now, turning to guidance. Historically, average sequential growth in Q2 has been roughly flat with Q1. However, the very fluid trade policies in the U.S. and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown, with the probability of a recession growing. This makes it more difficult to forecast how we will perform for the quarter and for the year, even as the underlying fundamentals supporting growth I discussed earlier remain intact.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWhile we have offsets, including a global, highly diversified manufacturing footprint to help mitigate tariffs, we will certainly see costs increase, and we feel it prudent to anticipate a TAM contraction. The biggest risk we see is the impact of a potential pullback in investment and spending as businesses and consumers react to higher costs and the uncertain economic backdrop. As a result, we're forecasting a wider-than-normal Q2 revenue range of $11.2 billion-$12.4 billion, down 2%-12% sequentially. Within Intel Products, we expect DCAI to decline at a faster rate than CCG. We expect Intel Foundry revenue down quarter-over-quarter due to pull-ins to Q1, lower wafer and advanced packaging volume, and capacity constraints in Intel 7, which we expect to persist for the foreseeable future. For All Other, we expect revenue for the sum of those parts to be roughly flat sequentially.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAt the midpoint of $11.8 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 36.5% on lower revenue and mix to our outsourced and lower-margin client products, with a tax rate of 12% and break-even EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis. As you think about the full year, we recommend you start by using the last 10 years' seasonality to model sequential changes in revenue, but be mindful of the significant uncertainty in markets today, especially due to the potential for meaningful tariffs and tight supply on our older nodes. We expect non-controlled income, or NCI, to net to zero in Q2 and for the full year to be approximately $500 million on a GAAP basis. NCI is still expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 to an updated range of $1.3 billion-$1.5 billion on a GAAP basis and meaningfully increase further in future years.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAs Lip-Bu discussed earlier, we're simplifying our organizational structure and the way we work across Intel so that we innovate faster and adapt more quickly where needed to better serve our customers. As a result, we now expect 2025 OPEX of $17 billion, $500 million lower than prior expectations, with a 2026 OPEX target of $16 billion. We are likely to have restructuring charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance. These spending reductions will be driven by numerous broad-based transformation activities. Key 2025 focus areas will be refocusing our portfolio, eliminating organizational complexity, transforming our engineering functions, and continuing to drive to leading SG&A efficiency.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nAs Lip-Bu stated, we anticipate our 2025 gross capital investment will now be approximately $18 billion, which is below our previous guide of $20 billion, reflecting further operational efficiencies and better utilization of our construction in progress. While gross CapEx is down, we maintain our range for 2025 net CapEx to be approximately $8-$11 billion due to uncertainty regarding timing of the U.S. government fulfilling their obligations in our CHIPS agreement. Beginning the process of delivering our balance sheet in 2025 remains a top priority for us, as evidenced by our lower OPEX and CapEx targets and the value unlock across our non-core assets. I'll wrap up by saying that Q1 was a solid quarter to start, even as the rest of the year is more uncertain. We will closely manage what's in our control and react quickly as the environment evolves.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nI'm encouraged by Lip-Bu's leadership and focus on enhancing our competitive position, improving our balance sheet, and setting us on a path to deliver consistent returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to John to begin the Q&A.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. Michelle Johnson Holthaus, CEO of Intel Products, will be joining Lip-Bu and Dave during the Q&A session. As a reminder, we would ask that each of you ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, John, can we take the first question, please?\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nCertainly, and our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Lip-Bu, welcome to Intel. Lip-Bu, the first question is for you. You talked a lot about increasing the flexibility and speed at Intel and, unfortunately, having to shrink the headcount to do so. How do we balance fixing the roadmap with also filling the foundry and making sure you have the unit volumes there? It seems like the flexibility and speed goals would be more quickly adopted and capitalized by going to foundry, but you have the need to fill your own Intel foundry. Balancing the internal product roadmap versus the foundry side of things is basically the question.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, Ross, thank you so much for the question. A couple of things. One is clearly the approach is basically to flatten the organization, the number of layers, so that we can really focus on the right products and then deliver the customer the solution. In terms of the product and the roadmap, I think clearly we need to focus on what is the killing product that we want to have and then laser focus on make sure that we deliver on time on the performance and the power so that make sure that we meet the customer requirement. In terms of the foundry, clearly 18A is very important for us, for Panther Lake. Secondly, I think we're clearly one by one improving the yield, the reliability, so that our internal customer can use of that. I think from the product side, they have to do the best they can and depend on whether it's inside or outside and then drive the performance of the products.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nRoss, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nYeah, I did have one for Dave. Dave, on the gross margin side of things, you talked a little bit about the slope for the rest of the year, but especially given the strategic changes that Lip-Bu's putting into place, the cost cutting in the OpEx side of things, and the lower CapEx that you talked about. Can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on gross margin if you think about 2025 as a whole and maybe even 2026? What are some of the goals that you have?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, sure, Ross. I'll qualify this by saying it's a relatively dynamic industry out there right now, given the tariffs and the implications on what that might look like from our TAM and from the macro. I'm saying this with some murkiness as it relates to the full year picture.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nI would just say that when we look out through the year, we do expect to see our mix on the client side move more to the Lunar Lake and so forth. As you know, Lunar Lake's margins are more under pressure given the memories and package, and that makes the accounting look a little funky. That will be a headwind to our margins on a go-forward basis. In addition, when we look at 18A, we're going to be ramping that through the year and there are startup costs associated with that, bringing that up in Arizona. That is always going to put some pressure on gross margins through the year as well. I think as you get into 2026, things start to go the other direction. Panther Lake will be ramping more in volume next year.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIt's a better margin product than Lunar Lake just on an apples-to-apples basis. On top of that, as you know, we have 18A on Panther Lake, so it brings the wafers back into the fabs and we get the margin stacking benefit of that on a kind of consolidated basis. We would expect next year to look better. Of course, all of that is subject. Ultimately, a lot of what is reflected in the margins is how we do on the top line side. We have to sort through how tariffs impact us. I think from a tariff perspective, this year could be choppy depending on what ultimately is settled across the U.S. and abroad. We do have a global supply chain.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe do have the ability to flex to mitigate a lot of the headwinds we face. It's just we can't obviously turn this stuff on a dime. It's going to take us time to optimize the network to what the rules are in terms of tariffs.\n\n**Ross Seymore** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Dave, can you help us just also on gross margin? Can you help us with sort of what a clean number is for March? You guided 36%, but that was supposed to have some cogs headwinds from the way you accounted for the grants, but it came in at 39%. So sort of what's the clean number for March? You said that the Q1 number would be the trough. I know you're guiding Q2 to 36, 5, but could it go lower than what you're guiding?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah. Yeah, I mean, obviously, we thought Q1 would be a trough and it turned out to be better. That puts some pressure on Q2 now on a relative basis. Like I said, the tariff dynamics do kind of change the outlook through the year. That is an additional pressure point for the gross margins through the year. In terms of the margins for Q1, kind of cleaning that out, I mean, clearly the biggest benefit to the gross margins was the beat on the top line. We kind of handedly beat top line. That helped out a lot. In addition, we did better or we had more of our volume come from Raptor Lake versus Lunar Lake. That was mixed beneficial to gross margins.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe did, I think, a little bit better job in terms of just managing spending and so forth that helped out. The two bigger components were the higher revenue and Raptor Lake. I think if you strip those two things out, we would have been much closer to the guide.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nTim, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nI do, yeah. Lip-Bu, I know the prior policy had been to not announce new third-party foundry customers. How do you think about that? Can you update us on sort of what you're tracking? Is there anything to help us believe that maybe you can add a tier one customer and maybe this year, if not sooner? I know that they want some power improvements on 18A. Can you kind of talk about that? Thank you.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nSure. Thanks, Tim. I think the priority one for us is for Intel Foundry is ramping our internal customer, like the Panther Lake I mentioned earlier. The next step is basically build the trust with our foundry customer and the PDK, the schedule, to really make sure that we're really robust on that. In terms of the process technology, the priority is really focused on yield, reliability. Also, I think it's very important to understand this is a customer service mindset so that every customer has different design tool, methodology, style. We want to make sure that we really do the pattern matching so that we really optimize for their solution they want to drive. I think it's kind of a one-two step, and then we really continue to drive the efficiency and then so that we can really scale the business.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Tim.\n\n**Operator**\nJonathan, can we have the next question, please? Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thank you. A number of elements in your letter and in your comments about kind of improving product execution. I guess five weeks into it, can you give us your assessment of Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest in the 18A product portfolio and give us a sense of, are those leadership products? Do you still have work to do to get to the leadership position that you want to have?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, let me start. I think Michelle will chip in. First of all, I think clearly our laser focus on execution and in terms of deliver on time, performance that we can meet the customer and industry trends and the workload. That is number one priority for us. In terms of Panther Lake, clearly on the 18A is very important. We have the first SKU by the end of this year. We have additional SKU the next year. I think so far we are very focused on that, Michelle.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, maybe just to add, Joe, I think I talked about this a little bit in our Q4 earnings. Panther Lake really matches what you see in both Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake and the way that we're going to ramp, bringing our first most performant product out first with customers and then the additional SKUs in Q1, which really allows us to line up with the commercial marketplace. That product looks quite good competitively, and we get a lot of customer interest. I think we continue to track well there.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYou also asked about Clearwater Forest, and I talked a bit about that and the prioritization between Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest in Q4 as well. For Clearwater Forest, it has some very unique packaging that comes to market with it. Therefore, we decided to prioritize getting Panther Lake out first. In the first half of 2026, you'll see Clearwater Forest. I would just remind you that Clearwater Forest is an E-core-based product. It is a derivative, right, of Granite Rapids. It will be more of a purpose-built product than your kind of leading performance part in the marketplace. Both are on track for delivery.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nJoe, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Joe Moore** (Managing Director)\nI do. Thank you for that. The comments that you guys made about 7 nanometer being constrained for the, I'm sorry, Intel 7 being constrained for the foreseeable future, can you elaborate on why that is and what impact that might have?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, good. Oh, pretty simply, we're doing better on Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake's an Intel 7 part. And so we obviously plan out our network to be just to the edge in terms of capacity. When things shift meaningfully like they did, we're going to be handing out. That said, that's usually a good thing for the factory. When they're constrained, they leverage the network to try to produce more wafers, and every wafer becomes less expensive as a result. We obviously do like that. Ultimately, though, we do want to see these AI PC products gain more traction in the market, and we're optimistic that happens through the year.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, maybe just to add on both 7 and 10 nanometer. Obviously, with the macroeconomic concerns that we see and just with the overall economy, we are particularly seeing consumer a stronger N-1 and N-2 demand in the marketplace as those system price points tend to stay rather fixed. We have been doing our best to respond to that shift. At the same time, in the commercial segment, we are seeing that Windows 10 refresh and a strong demand for AI PCs. I think there's both good and bad news in that. As you see N-1, N-2, as Dave talked about, you see a lot of that gross margin flow to the bottom line. It is also, as the AI PC ramp slows, that's also good for gross margins. I do want you to walk away with the fact that we continue to invest in the AI PC.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nWe do view this as the long-term growth segment. We have our AI symposium with all the software vendors this week, and we see a ton of excitement from our customers around Lunar Lake. We will be balancing our portfolio and our mix across our foundries.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question for Lip-Bu. You touched on your AI strategy focusing on new and emerging workloads like reasoning models, agentic AI, and physical AI. Is the plan here to reinvent X86 to succeed in the AI world or perhaps a broader portfolio, including ARM? Should we be interpreting your focus more on edge AI? Thank you.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, good question, CJ. I think first of all, as I articulate on the AI strategy, it's very important to understand the workload and then make sure that we can really deliver. Clearly, we're going to look for partnership with the industry leader to build a purpose-built silicon and a software to optimize for that platform. We like to be the compute platform for doing that. Clearly, I think one of the big areas will be the kind of edge and inference area. That will be important to have the architecture that are low power and drive efficiency. Those kind of things that we are exploring, some of this new architecture and some of this disruptive platform that we try to build. Stay tuned. Over time, we're going to start to articulate the strategy for that.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nCJ, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nI do, John. Thanks. So Dave, to follow up on the OPEX guide for 2025 and 2026, do those numbers fully contemplate the headcount reductions that you are planning, or over time, could we see additional savings?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I would say Lip-Bu has driven us to think about the company in a leaner, more efficient, faster-to-execution kind of way. That's been kind of the underpinning of what we are doing from an OPEX perspective. It's all of that elimination of the bureaucracy, taking out the layers, and so forth that drive us to a number that's kind of in the $17 billion range for 2025 and $16 billion range for 2026. We are still in the process of working through the details of how we land to that number. I feel confident based on his direction, we will land in that zip code for those numbers.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe have not yet identified what that means from a headcount perspective. There are obviously other categories of spend in operating expenses in addition to labor, and those will also be looked at. We will scrutinize and make sure that they are spent in a highly efficient manner. We will have more details around how we will land the $16 billion number for 2026 when we end the second quarter and do the earnings in July. I think we will have a good sense of what that means. Whether it can be reduced further, I think we will have to see. I think the $16 billion number, we feel very confident we can land.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nWe will update you in July as to for sure where that number is with a little bit more precision. I think if you asked Lip-Bu today, he would probably say there are areas where he would like to invest as well. To the extent we're freeing up investment, it may go to some other areas that he wants to invest in. I think sixteen would probably be the good working assumption, but we'll update you in July, like I said.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, CJ. Can we have the next question, please, Jonathan?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nYeah, hi. I was just wondering, as you look at the data center side, how you see that playing out through the year? I saw you kind of got a June and then saw a little bit.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nCJ, apologize. Can you restate that? You broke up a little bit at the beginning of the question.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nJust wondering how the data center side would play out through the rest of the year as you look at the second half, especially.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, thank you for the question. As we look at Q1, we saw higher than expected growth really driven by a few hyperscalers. We are optimistic about the rest of the year. If you look at the product roadmap we have with Granite Rapids coming out and Xeon 6, some of the traditional consolidation that that drives, as well as being the CPO choice as the AI head node. We are starting to see some improvement in telco as well. However, as Dave and everyone's talked about, we still do see a large macro concern, and we need to continue to understand what that means. Much like we talked about before in client, we are seeing strong demand on older gen parts in data center as well, and we're working through that from a supply perspective.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nAs stated in last quarter's earnings, I talked about our main goal being to stabilize market segment share, create margin, and drive up ASPs. Those are things that we're going to be laser-focused on for the remainder of the year. We do have a good product portfolio. We do see strength both in hyperscalers and enterprise, but rest of world is where we really see a market segment share challenge. That is where we'll be focused.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nCJ, do you have a follow-up question?\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nYeah, thanks, John. And Lip-Bu, congratulations on the new assignment. Just looking at CapEx, and maybe this is for Dave, any thoughts on how you would look at CapEx for that timeframe, 2025, 2026? Are you looking at rationalizing that given the footprint, that footprint that you have?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. Okay.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nIn 2025, we think we can operate to an $18 billion number, as we talked about. I would just tell you we have $50 billion or so of assets under construction that are a lot of which are as equipment that's still in bubble wrap. We are in some ways taking a more aggressive approach to driving better return on what we've spent already. That is allowing us to spend less in capital. I think that story probably plays out next year as well, although I think it's too early to talk about guidance for CapEx for next year. We are going to leverage our assets under construction next year as well. Longer term, this is a high-intensity model, obviously. We've talked about roughly having 25% capital intensity as we look at this in a full IDM model. I think that's probably a good working assumption on a long-term basis.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThank you, BJ. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to that 7 nanometer constraint or capacity constraint. You said you're seeing a lot of demand for Raptor. I guess I'm just surprised given how good Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake are supposed to be. Why are you seeing so much more demand for the older generation parts versus new ones? I mean, are you pushing the older gen stuff because the margins are better? What's going on there?\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, thanks for the question, Stacy. We're not pushing the old parts based on margins. What we're really seeing is much greater demand from our customers for N-1 and N-2 products so that they can continue to deliver system price points that consumers are really demanding. As we've all talked about, the macroeconomic concerns and tariffs have everybody kind of hedging their bets in what they need to have from an inventory perspective. Raptor Lake is a great part. Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake are great as well, but come with a much higher cost structure, not only for us, but at the system ASP price points for our OEMs as well.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nAs you think about an OEM perspective, they've also ridden those cost curves down from a Raptor Lake perspective, and it allows them to offer that product at a better price point. I really just think it's macroeconomics, the overall economy, and how they're hedging their bets.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nStacy, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director)\nI do. To follow up on that then, so what does that imply for the Panther Lake launch, which I guess is going to happen, you said by year-end, so I guess we'll get at least one SKU by December. Most of it comes next year. If that's happening in the midst of a macro event, tariffs, who knows, how do I think about the launch of those new products given demand seems to be pivoting back to the older products and the environment hasn't even gotten bad yet?\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, I think it's a very fair question. The Panther Lake launch matches exactly what we did on both Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake in regards to timing. It is very aligned with how customers like to take products to market. Panther Lake is a great product both from a performance and price perspective for our customers. I think you'll see a strong uptake of that product, right? We still see very strong commercial demand for AI PCs as they're deploying their fleets, as they're doing their upgrades. They want to future-proof their products and have that AI capability. I don't think you're going to see that change in commercial.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nIf you look at our traditional ramps, for these types of products, we tend to go faster in commercial first, and then consumers come on board. We will have to balance where is the economy at the end of the year. I feel very bullish about the Panther Lake product and our customer feedback.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you. Michelle, I want to go back to the comments you made about the server market, in particular about the Q2 guidance. I'm just curious as to why Q2 is tracking a little bit weaker. And then as we look out to the next few quarters, I know you talked about Granite Rapids ramping and also potentially TAM growing from a per core basis in double digits. At the same time, we do have incremental competition from ARM, especially in head nodes, where I think you guys have done well. I'm just wondering how to think about, maybe talk about why the guidance is a little softer for Q2 and then how to think about your market share for the next few quarters. Thank you.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, thank you for the question. As I look at Q1, I mean, we had a few hyperscalers that were particularly strong in Q1. You could call that hedging your bets or doing Polands or just balancing out their portfolio. We do not expect to continue to see that into Q2. When we look at the overall macro demand, the concern around tariffs and restrictions, as well as the stronger demand for older generation parts, there is more demand there than we currently can supply. You have to balance that as well. As I have continued to say, we are going to do everything we can to stabilize market segment share. That also creates a lot of margin and ASP pressure that we need to balance throughout the year. Granite Rapids is a great product.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nWe are seeing excitement from our customers around that, particularly in the consolidation, particularly with edge AI, a lot of excitement from customers about finding ways to be able to offer service revenue there. At the same time, as you said, there is good competition. We are just being, I think, very prudent in what the year looks like. We understand there is competition, but we have got a good product portfolio. As Lip-Bu said, we want a very strong say-do ratio. We are going to commit to a number that we can beat.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nSrini, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nYeah. On Panther Lake, I know Lip-Bu said it is a priority to ramp 18A with Panther Lake. I know in the past, your target was to, I guess, bring in 70% of the die in-house to 18A. I am just wondering if that is still the target. As we look forward to Nova Lake, has the decision about internal versus external been made yet? If so, maybe you can give us some color on that as to what % or how you think about internal versus external mix for Nova Lake. Thank you.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, both are great questions. When we look at 18A, our goal of bringing everything in-house, getting to a 70%, approximately 70% mix remains steadfast, and there's no change to that POR. Panther Lake helps us get on that journey. Pat talked about this in Q3. I talked about it in Q4. One of the great strengths we have is the fact that we do have optionality when it comes to where we build our products. We build products with TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nWhen you look at Nova Lake, really what we have done is we've optimized at the SKU level the process node that we're going to use. When you look at Nova Lake, you'll see product both at TSMC and you'll see product internal to Intel. When you look at the aggregate of Nova Lake, we will build more wafers on Intel process than we are on Panther Lake. That commitment to continue to drive wafer growth with our internal foundry partners remains steadfast, and there's no change to strategy there.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nI just add one other thing that I come over the top of the organization on is we are going to continue to balance internal and external manufacturing of wafers. We do that because that's part of our capital strategy to maintain a reasonable capital intensity relative to the business. Just as much as we're pushing on filling the fab and making sure we're utilizing all of our assets and leveraging the investments we've made on the process side, we also want to make sure that we're not over-investing in capital and are left ultimately with a bad answer from a return on asset perspective. That's part of our smart capital strategy, always to keep a certain percentage of our wafer capacity outside.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Srini. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley from Barclays. Your question, please.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Managing Director)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This one's for Dave, a little more shorter term. Just if you look at the first 20-something days of the quarter here, I was surprised that you saw a little bit of weakness on the client side. Obviously, data center down a little bit more. Could you maybe just give us an update on if you're seeing any pull-ins, any changes in dynamics from a geography perspective, any customer behaviors that are looking any different for the first couple of days of this quarter, just as it helps as a framework for the entire market and then also for you guys as well?\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, I would just say that for the first whatever number of days that is, I didn't count it, so I'm assuming it is 20 days. We are off to a relatively strong start. What we are anticipating and what's built into our guidance is that the macro is going to start to catch up to the implications of the tariffs. June is likely to be softer than our strong start to the quarter. So far, we're off to a strong start. Of course, I can't completely rule out that it might continue through the whole quarter, in which case we're probably looking at the higher end of the guidance. For now, we've built in the expectation that tariffs will start to weigh on the macro.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nTom, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Managing Director)\nYeah, I do. Michelle, in December when we chatted, when you first took over the job, you spoke about product being first. Specifically, we talked about the data center side of things. I think earlier to CJ's question, you addressed the edge. If you look at the products that you've had with Gowdy, Falcon Shores inside the data center specifically, could you talk about what the strategy will be going forward? Are you planning on launching a new product? I think at the time you said, \"We need to learn with what we've already had, so we're not starting from scratch.\" Any update to that strategy, particularly inside the data center?\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, I'm glad that you asked. Actually, in the first five weeks that Lip-Bu's been here, he and Sachin have spent a significant amount of time relooking at our whole AI strategy, our portfolio of assets, how we need to come to market to be able to compete in that marketplace. You've heard Lip-Bu really talk about the fact that we want a workload-first approach. In Q4, I talked about the fact that we weren't going to build Falcon Shores, right, and that we were going to stay with the POR of Jaguar Shores. We still have a Jaguar Shores product on our roadmap.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nSachin and Lip-Bu over the coming month or so will start to talk externally about what our AI roadmap looks like, what we'll do in between then, and then as we really dive in with our customers on that workload roadmap, what needs to change. I think you'll see us be quite aggressive. We know that that is a segment of the data center market that we're not competing in today, and we need a robust portfolio as all the customers are looking for alternatives.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Tom. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Senior Research Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. Lip-Bu, for the first one, you said there are no quick fixes. How much time realistically should investors be prepared for in terms of Intel turnaround? Is it one year, two years, three years? Related to that, what are the right metrics to measure that progress? Is it share gains? Is it gross margins? Is it free cash flow? Basically, what metrics are you optimizing for, and what is the timeline in order to achieve that?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, Vivek, it's a good question. I think clearly there's no quick fix, as you described. As we're working through the roadmap and weekly update with the team and then defining what the new workload looks like in terms of the CPU, GPU, and AI, and then driving some short-term and some longer-term products. In the shorter term, we may embrace some of the disruptive technology that's out there, and we can partner with them to bring the market faster and then meet the customer requirement. I think stay tuned.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI mean, those are the things that we are working on. In terms of the matrix, clearly we want to have the best products. That is really, especially addressing the edge, it has got to be power efficiency and also able to drive the performance that we like. Time to market is critical on schedule. Those are the things that we look at in terms of matrix to really deliver what the industry wants and customers want. That is something that we are working on.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nVivek, do you have a quick follow-up?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Senior Research Analyst)\nYes, thanks, Tom. On the IDM structure, Lip-Bu, given your experience in the industry, what we have seen from the outside is that the most successful businesses in semis are either fabless or dedicated foundry. A few years ago, when Intel started to give out financials for the manufacturing business, the hope was that that would turn it around. What we have seen is just consistently negative gross margins. Do you think that just 18A progress is sufficient? Just kind of low single-digit top-line growth is sufficient to make this business viable? At what point do you need to rethink whether this IDM structure, regardless of the way financials are broken out, does it make sense?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nI think it's a good question. I think clearly we want to have that kind of balanced approach. One is the foundry has to be able to deliver the product that internal customers need and also can serve our Intel customers well so that we make them the simplicity and also online schedule to deliver.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nIn that respect, we clearly view TSMC as our partner. They have been very good partners to have. Morris and CC are a very long-time friend of mine. We also met recently, tried to find areas we can collaborate in so that we can create a win-win situation. Meanwhile, we continue to drive the efficiency, the yield, that 18A and also look at with the customer, what can we do on the 14A so that we can really wisely, effectively use some of the foundry footprint that we have.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nVivek, thank you. Jonathan, we've got time for one last question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director)\nYeah, thanks, John, for fitting me in. I guess maybe the first question would be just as I think about the guidance that you gave and more importantly, the operating expense structure that you talked about in 2025 and 2026, just to be very clear, that's exclusive of the pending divestiture of the 51% stake in Alterra. I guess that's just a point of clarification.\n\n**David Zinsner** (CFO)\nYeah, let me decide what exclusive means. But essentially, the $17 billion in 2025 and the $16 billion in 2026 actually assume Alterra's OPEX is in that number. Now, obviously, as soon as we deconsolidate, it won't be. So the target of the $16 billion will come down dollar for dollar for what Alterra is spending in terms of OPEX. But given that it hasn't closed, we don't know the timing of when it closes. It was a little difficult to provide anything with that built into the forecast, so we just included it.\n\n**John Pitzer** (VP of Investor Relations)\nAaron, do you have a follow-up?\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director)\nI do. It's maybe more strategic back to kind of the core data center AI strategy. I know it's early days, but Lip-Bu, I'm curious of how you think about rack scale networking and the pieces that Intel has internally to really compete in the cloud infrastructure AI build-out. Is it UCIE? Are there other pieces of the building blocks that you think strategically are needed to really drive if it's with Jaguar Shores or how that strategy plays out around the networking scale upside?\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nYeah, it's a good question. Let me start first, and then Michelle will add on to it. Clearly, the rack scale approach of the system, I think, is very important that we need to have a full scale in hardware and software to do it. Then clearly leverage on our XPU, CPU, and GPU approach and then to drive that. I think that will be something that we kind of work on and then come up with a killing product that we can really launch the product.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nYeah, maybe I would just add that we are seeing great success with the IPU products that we've built. We will see at least double-digit or, excuse me, doubling of that revenue from 2024 to 2025. We also see optics as a critical element of that rack scale architecture as well. I think I would just remind everybody that Intel is the only foundry out there that has an optics-based foundry option for our customers.\n\n**Michelle Johnston Holthaus** (CEO of Intel Products)\nWe are very optimistic that those two things add to the overall opportunity to build out that rack scale architecture. Also, just our Open X86. What we are seeing is that customers do love the X86 ecosystem, the software around it. If they can build out an AI infrastructure with X86, they are very interested in doing that. We already have one large custom design win, and I would expect more.\n\n**Aaron Rakers** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Lip-Bu Tan** (CEO)\nWith that, thank you for joining us today. We have a clear opportunity to strengthen our business in both products and foundry. We have clear priorities to better serve our customers and create value to our shareholders. I look forward to work ahead as we build a new Intel. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
