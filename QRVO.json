Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on a touch-tone phone. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Douglas DeLieto** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks very much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2026 third quarter earnings call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating, operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.\n\n**Douglas DeLieto** (VP of Investor Relations)\nDuring our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today, available on our investor relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Financial Releases. Lastly, for detailed information regarding the Skyworks and Qorvo combination announced on October 28th, I encourage you to review the press release, investor presentation, Qorvo merger proxy, and related materials available on our investor relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Events and Presentations. Today's call will focus on our fiscal third quarter results as well as our outlook for the March quarter, and we will not be commenting on the proposed business combination. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO, Grant Brown, CFO, Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, and other members of Qorvo's management team.\n\n**Douglas DeLieto** (VP of Investor Relations)\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nThanks, Doug, and welcome everyone to our call. In our fiscal third quarter, Qorvo delivered solid financial performance with notable strategic achievements across each operating segment. We continue to pursue our long-term growth strategy while executing on restructuring actions to optimize profitability and reduce capital intensity. In ACG, we are supporting the world's leading smartphone OEMs with best-in-class products for their highest value, flagship and premium-tier devices. In CSG, we enjoy broad representation in Wi-Fi applications, and we are expanding our reach in automotive, enterprise, industrial, and other customer segments with our ultra-wideband technology. In HPA, we are growing across a range of customer applications, such as defense and aerospace, satellite communications, power, and infrastructure. Within our factory network, we closed our Costa Rica facility in December, a few months ahead of schedule, and have transitioned to external partners.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nThe transfer of SAW filter production from Greensboro, North Carolina, to Richardson, Texas, remains on track. With these actions, we will be able to operate more efficiently with reduced capital intensity, and we will continue to differentiate our products with onshore manufacturing of GaAs, GaN, BAW, SAW, and advanced multi-chip modules. Turning to quarterly highlights. In ACG, December quarterly revenue declined sequentially, in line with the view we provided last quarter and consistent with typical seasonality. At our largest customer, content gains on their ramping platform helped to support double-digit revenue growth compared to last December. We supply a diverse portfolio of high-performance discretes, tuners, ET PMICs, and integrated modules to our largest customer, not all of which have been awarded on the upcoming platforms. However, at this time, for the upcoming fiscal year, we expect revenue at our largest customer to be approximately flat.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nFor our ET PMIC, increasing internal modem adoption provides a multiyear structural tailwind as platforms transition away from third-party modems. With regard to integrated modules, on the ultra-high-band PAD, we received lower share in the upcoming phone models than last year, and we expect our ultra-high-band PAD revenue to decline year over year. This is a placement where we have demonstrated success across multiple generations. We remain confident in our highly differentiated technology and our ability to compete effectively over subsequent generations. In our largest customer's cellular-enabled iPads, we were awarded the high-band PAD, representing a product and technology milestone and new content for Qorvo on that platform. We are extremely pleased to have secured this placement. The win gives us the opportunity to demonstrate capability and execute at scale on that platform, consistent with our long-term investment strategy. Turning to Android.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nWe remain a leading supplier in premium and flagship smartphones, while we continue to reduce our exposure to low-margin, mass-tier smartphones. In the December quarter, total Android revenue declined sequentially in the low double digits. In the March quarter, we expect a greater than seasonal decline in Android revenue. For fiscal 2027, we expect Android revenue to decline by approximately $300 million versus fiscal 2026, driven primarily by our actions to reduce exposure to lower-margin segments, and secondarily, by the impact of memory pricing and availability on mass-tier Android build plans. Qorvo enjoys broad participation across smartphone OEMs, and we are not seeing signs of memory pricing or memory availability impacting the flagship and premium tiers. With our largest customer expected to be approximately flat, ACG revenue is expected to decline in fiscal 2027 by the reduction in Android revenue.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nThis is an intentional resizing of our Android business. We are reducing exposure to lower margin segments while continuing to serve Android's high-volume premium and flagship tiers. We expect the improvement in product mix to support a higher gross margin in ACG. Additionally, with ongoing OpEx reduction efforts, we expect to deliver expanding operating margins in ACG on the healthier revenue mix. In CSG, we're on track with an automotive ultra-wideband program with a leading automotive Tier 1. Regarding this platform, we are very pleased to announce we did receive our first production orders during the December quarter. This program will span multiple years and support multiple OEMs. We continue to see expansion of our engagements across the automotive customer base. Use cases for Qorvo's automotive ultra-wideband technology includes secure access, digital key, child presence detection, and short-range radar sensing.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nWe are supplying both our ultra-wideband and Wi-Fi 7 solutions in collaboration with multiple Tier 1 manufacturers of network access points. We're seeing strong customer demand, and initial deployments include hospitals, factories, and other enterprises requiring ultra-precision indoor navigation and location awareness. Our Wi-Fi portfolio is proudly represented in flagship smartphones, fiber gateways, mesh networks, client devices, and SatCom ground terminals, and we continue to expand our Wi-Fi, FEM, and filter portfolio to enable higher bandwidth, lower latency, interconnected networks. We delivered first Wi-Fi 8 samples during the December quarter, and customer engagement in Wi-Fi 8 is increasing. Regarding the CSG restructuring discussed last quarter, these actions remain on track. During the quarter, we successfully divested our MEMS-based sensing solutions business. While this represents a headwind to year-over-year CSG growth next fiscal year, it is one of multiple initiatives we are undertaking to improve CSG's profitability.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nTurning to HPA, we continue to see multiyear tailwinds in D&A, data center power, and infrastructure markets. In D&A, the passage of the fiscal 2026 NDAA includes top priorities such as Golden Dome, the F-47 fighter, and the Navy's next-generation fighters, warships, and drones. Qorvo is a beneficiary of new platforms, upgrade cycles, RF content growth, and increases in defense spending. As an example, Golden Dome is a multilayer defense system that requires significant RF content. For the full fiscal year 2027, sales in D&A markets are expected to total approximately $500 million. In power management, our strategic emphasis on PMIC for enterprise-class SSDs has been met with continued data center growth, where customer demand has been very strong. During the quarter, we taped out our first chip for our next-generation enterprise SSD platform. Other power opportunities for Qorvo includes AESA radars, drones, robotics, wearables, and smartphones.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nThere is strong interest globally in Qorvo's AESA solutions, combining our FEMs, beamforming ICs, power management, and power control. In infrastructure markets, there are increased content requirements in DOCSIS 4.0 systems that align well with our amplifier and control portfolios. Qorvo is a leading supplier of broadband amplifiers for DOCSIS 4.0, and we are well positioned with all major suppliers. We're also a market leader in small signal, receive, and transmit components used across the RF chain of 5G radio access network. While these products have historically been deployed in terrestrial 5G infrastructure, we are increasingly seeing the same RF building blocks adopted in adjacent applications, such as drones and low Earth orbit satellite communications, including direct-to-cell satellite architectures. We are sharply focused on growing our highest-performing businesses, and we are divesting or exiting businesses that underperform.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nIn fiscal 2027, we forecast a mid-single-digit decline in full-year revenue for the company as ACG declines and becomes more profitable, CSG is approximately flat, and HPA continues its double-digit growth. As we move through fiscal 2027, we expect our defense and aerospace business will be larger than our Android business. That's a meaningful shift in the portfolio that reflects both the strategic resizing of our Android business and continued growth in HPA. This increasingly favorable mix positions us to deliver full-year FY 2027 gross margins above 50% and EPS approaching $7 per share. These outcomes reflect continued operating expense discipline, a structurally improved portfolio mix, and our sustained commitment to innovation and operations excellence. And with that, I'll turn it over to Grant.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's fiscal third quarter revenue of $993 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 49.1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings of $2.17 per share, all compared favorably to guidance. During the quarter, our largest customer represented approximately 53% of revenue. On the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we held approximately $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents and approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding, with no near-term maturities. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $530 million. This represents a sequential reduction of $75 million and a decrease of $111 million compared to where we ended last fiscal year.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nDuring the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $265 million and incurred $28 million of capital expenditures, which resulted in free cash flow of $237 million. Regarding our outlook for Fiscal Q4, our guidance reflects continued momentum in HPA, offset by our strategic pivot from lower-margin mass-tier Android and the normal seasonal decline at our largest customer. Our expectations for the March quarter are as follows: revenue of $800 million ± $25 million, non-GAAP gross margin between 48% and 49%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.20 ± $0.15. Gross margin continues to improve on a year-over-year basis. In Q3, non-GAAP gross margin increased approximately 260 basis points versus last fiscal year, and we expect a similar improvement year-over-year in Q4.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThis improvement is a direct result of multiple initiatives. We've actively managed our product portfolio and pricing strategies to reduce exposure to mass-tier Android 5G. We've positioned the company to benefit from growth in D&A, which is margin accretive. We've divested or exited margin diluted businesses, and we continue to manage factory costs aggressively as we have consolidated our manufacturing footprint. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter to be between $240 million and $250 million. Below the operating income line, non-operating expense is expected to be between $8 million-$10 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2026 is expected to be approximately 15%.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe continue to monitor the situation as changes to tax policy in the U.S. and internationally may evolve over time. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our queue. The first question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So thanks for the color on the content. I think, Bob, you mentioned the ultra-high band, potentially not having as much content there in this generation, but you have some of the ET coming back in. If you look at the next several generations of content, it looks like with this dual sourcing, you've seen a lot more swimming in other people's lanes, is the way I think I've heard it talked about in the past, where, you know, one guy would compete in, you know, a couple sockets, and now you've seen that proliferating to some other sockets, which has just kind of increased the competition, and you guys have called out a couple of areas where you're seeing that. Maybe talk about the content roadmap on a go-forward basis.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Analyst)\nLike, do you think that there are other sockets—you obviously talked about the high band or the mid-high band and the iPads. Like, do you see other sockets where you could have some more traction? Or do you feel like the wind's behind you or in front of you in terms of content over the next several generations? Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nYeah, thanks a lot. Appreciate the question, Tom. And, you know, as you know, we don't like to comment on future generations or even architectures, but I will say that, you know, there continues to be opportunity for us to continue to grow our footprint there, no doubt about it. You know, it, it's been, as you know, a lot of it was sole sourced. As you can see, it does appear they're multi-sourcing more, or at least dual sourcing, I should say, more sockets in the future. And, you know, we're investing in R&D to continue to grow at our largest customer.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Analyst)\nHelpful. Then just a clarification on the second one. I think you mentioned into March, Android would be down more than seasonal. I'm sure there's a million different ways, five, 10, 15 years, you can look at seasonal. But in terms of what I have here, Android was actually up in the March quarter. I know you've seen some different seasonality. What do you mean by down more than seasonal? What is normal seasonal for March in Android?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nYeah, I appreciate the question, Tom, and you're exactly right. Typically, Android has been up in the March quarter, and as we've been strategically exiting a lot of that lower margin business, and we talked last quarter about even some of the Android ramps and other phones that, you know, we're not participating as much. Again, due to our strategic emphasis on, you know, making sure we're getting paid for the value we bring, and this year it's gonna be down quarter over quarter. So that's the big swing. You're correct.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from Peter Peng with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAre you there, Peter?\n\n**Peter Peng** (Analyst)\nOh, hi. Hi, thanks for taking my question. But just for the Android business, I think the prior expectation was, you know, you're gonna exit by about $200 million, and now you guys are saying $300 million. So maybe just talk about whether that is just expedite exit. Is it the memory impact? What drove the, you know, accelerated pace? And then, you know, as we think about longer term, what is the business revenue run rate, you know, after you're finishing, you know, exiting on this business?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nHey, Peter, this is Grant. Let me take that one, and then Dave can fill in some more detail. So we've said that it'll be a multi-year event as we exit the lower margin or lower-tier Android businesses. It could run approximately $150 million-$200 million in our fiscal 2026, and then again in our fiscal 2027. Last quarter, we had mentioned that we expected the larger portion of that in our fiscal 2026 to hit in the second half, and especially impacting the March quarter, and that's exactly what we're seeing in results.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThen in fiscal 2027, instead of the $150 million-$200 million, we're taking that estimate up to $300 million that we could exit in fiscal 2027, and that's fully due to our strategic exit from the business, as well as some of the memory pricing and availability constraints that are impacting customers' build plans.\n\n**Peter Peng** (Analyst)\nPerfect. And then just on the gross margin, you talked about potentially getting to the, you know, the 50%. Maybe you can kind of lay it out on how, you know, we should think about that margin profile over the course of the 2027?\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nYep. Peter, we're getting a lot of background noise when we're talking. I don't know if it's on your end or not.\n\n**Peter Peng** (Analyst)\nLet me-\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nAll right, go ahead.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. So I think your question was around margin profile, so as we look out into fiscal 2027?\n\n**Peter Peng** (Analyst)\nThat, that is right, that is right.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nOkay. Yeah, so the biggest driver for margin as we look out in fiscal 2027 is mix. That's both business mix, as HPA becomes a larger percentage of the total, which is margin accretive, as well as product mix inside of the segments, especially within ACG. We've talked at length about the exit from the lower-tier Android business, which is having a sizable effect. Obviously, our utilizations aren't where we'd like them to be, but you know, the biggest gains in gross margin for the moment are coming from that business mix I talked about. So there's still further headroom, you know, as we add additional volumes over time. You know, I would compliment the operations team.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThey've, you know, done a considerable job of pulling costs out while maintaining the capacity that we need to strategically target very important pieces of business all while transferring multiple lines of production, which is not a small feat, as Bob commented earlier, you know, both on Costa Rica as well as the North Carolina transition to Texas.\n\n**Peter Peng** (Analyst)\nThank you, guys.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from Gary Mobley with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and thanks for the explicit guidance, Bob, for fiscal year 27, and specifically on Apple. You're calling for revenue to be flat in fiscal year 27, with perhaps some content loss in the upcoming iPhone 18, you know, in aggregate. So is that more or less one part volume growth, offset equally by some content decline? Maybe you can just help us out there in terms of, like, your volume assumption for iPhone units, I guess, you know-\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nYeah\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Analyst)\n-that assumption.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nYeah, thanks, Gary, and we're not going to comment on our largest customers' volumes or expectations. We're just giving you an indication of what we think our revenue is going to be, given everything we know at this time.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Analyst)\nGot it. Got it. Okay, and then looking at your fourth quarter revenue guide, it's down about $70 million, roughly, on a year-over-year basis. How much of that decrease is a function of business divestments? I believe there might be two significant business divestments, you know, within that year-over-year comparison, and I would assume the rest is mostly Android related.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThat's correct. The vast majority of it is Android related. You know, it's relatively small from the, the divestitures that we've made. And the Android component of that, obviously, we'll see how that exactly plays out. We're seeing, you know, both our strategic exit as well as some of the, customer forecast driven by some memory pricing concerns, which is just starting to find its way into the customer dialogue.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Analyst)\nThanks so much for the question. So I think previously you guys were quite optimistic around integrated modules and ramping integrated modules. Obviously, this dual sourcing is a setback, but perhaps if you can talk about your products here, how you feel about them and how you feel about your prospects moving forward, particularly for integrated modules.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (CEO)\nYeah. And, Gary, just to be clear, the ultra-high-band has been a dual-sourced part for many, many years, probably five or six years. We've always had content in it. We just have less this year than prior years. And, you know, I talked about the high-band PAD, and, you know, that's an area we hadn't been, so the dual sourcing is actually helping us in that case. So that's how I'd actually answer your question.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Analyst)\nOkay.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nMaybe, Gary, in terms of, in terms of revenue, maybe, you know, there's always a considerable number of variables to consider in addition to content, gains and losses, including the, the timing of certain different awards, as well as the volume of, of, specific SKUs, the mix, launch cadence across those models. You know, but at least from a modeling perspective, in terms of our assumptions, I think the key point is that all of our, our underlying assumptions are, are fully reflected in the, the fiscal 2027 outlook that Bob provided earlier.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Company Representative)\nThanks, Chris.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Analyst)\nYeah, sorry, me. Yeah, and just maybe, maybe just following up there, you, you did have some comments about not being, I think, totally decided for the year, but you—it sounds like you guys have pretty good visibility here, and we probably shouldn't be expecting any more surprises, either positive or negative versus your flat guide year-over-year. Is that fair?\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (VP of Sales and Marketing)\nYeah, that's fair. There's always certain components, you know, particularly around tuners, that are awarded later in the cycle. But, yeah, everything's kind of reflected in the guide that Bob gave.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Analyst)\nExcellent. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (VP of Sales and Marketing)\nThanks, Chris.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\n**Robert Mertens** (Analyst)\nHello, this is Robert Mertens on the line for Krish Sankar. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that Android sales are expected to decline roughly $300 million next year, and walk us through how the exiting of the low-end space will impact the business. But could you just walk us through a little bit more about how the current higher memory prices and costs are affecting your mobile business, and how you think that might play out next year?\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (VP of Sales and Marketing)\nYeah, this is Dave. Yeah, so that decline we're talking about is primarily as a result of the ongoing intentional resizing of the Android business that we've been talking about for almost a year now. Secondarily, what we're seeing related to the memory pricing and availability, as OEMs adjust their build plans to react to that, it definitely pressures the mass tier as customers prioritize the supply that they get towards the higher end devices. So this has an acceleration effect on our strategy, but it really doesn't change the end result. But that, that's why you're seeing, you know, the higher $300 million decline that we called out for FY 2027 versus what we had called out earlier.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd maybe I'll just add to that a little bit, Dave, as far as the profile of our revenue throughout the year. You know, as you, as you start to think past March and into June, the dynamic that Dave was describing will play out. You know, it's a little too early to put too fine a point on it, since we only guide in any detailed way for the next quarter. But, you know, it's worth pointing out that historical seasonality, even in June, say, down 5%-10% sequentially, no longer applies for the reasons were mentioned and the strategic actions around Android are, you know, strategically managing down our Android exposure in the mass tier, as well as a seasonal downtick in our revenues from our largest customer.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nNormally, those would offset, and we're not gonna see that. You know, we hadn't seen it in March, we won't see it in June. And then secondarily, you know, as we've talked about our D&A business, on a year-over-year basis, we continue to see a considerable strength there, but it'll be down as we look into June, which is pretty typical, coming off of a very strong March. So, you know, as D&A has grown to be a larger contributor to our top line, the impact on June seasonality has also grown. So the profile of our business will change because of, you know, to a large degree, the Android exit, as we were communicating earlier.\n\n**Robert Mertens** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you. That's helpful and makes sense for our customers to prioritize the higher end. Just real quick, in line with that, are you seeing any sort of changes in terms of inventory level at customers, or this in line or higher or lower than what you would typically expect at this time of year?\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (VP of Sales and Marketing)\nYeah, I wouldn't say we've seen anything abnormal as it relates to inventory. It's just more of a reaction to how they're adjusting their build plans, given the situation that's going on with the memory.\n\n**Robert Mertens** (Analyst)\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Analyst)\nThank you very much. Bob, you said you'd have lower share in the high band. Obviously, the iPad isn't gonna be a big driver for unit volume, but the mix should favor your ET, and that's like $1.80 extra content. And apparently, that's gonna be a significant shift, given what we saw last year versus what we saw this year. So doesn't this imply that you're seeing significant share loss in ultra-high band, or are there other parts that we don't know that you haven't mentioned, that you're not gonna be on the new phone? I know Dave talked about tuners always get added towards the end of it, but plus or minus on that isn't gonna be, I wouldn't think, correct me if I'm wrong, I wouldn't think you're in the dollar range of content. So I'm just trying to get my arms around this shift, 'cause the wind should be at your back in the forward, just for ET itself, and it doesn't sound like that's the case at all.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Company Representative)\nYeah. Hey, Ed, this is Frank Stewart. Maybe just to reiterate, the things that we're excited about is the high-band PAD win that we got. The headwind that we have is the loss of share in UHB. Working very hard to get that back in the following generation. We agree that as the internal modem is used on more SKUs, that is a tailwind for us. When you put it all together with all of our estimates of how all that plays out, again, we can only talk to our expectations for revenue. When you play that out over our fiscal year, it comes together with about flat year-over-year.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Analyst)\nOkay. I just wanted to be sure we had all the moving parts together. But it's- you're still gonna be in the ultra-high band, you're just gonna see lower share.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Company Representative)\nYes.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Analyst)\nYou're not gonna get kicked out of that.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Company Representative)\nYeah, that's right. That's right.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Analyst)\nAll right. Yeah, I just wanna make sure that's the case. And then, Grant, underutilization charges, it sounds like, especially if you're gonna be flat, et cetera, did you incur any this quarter? Do you expect any coming up? Is that mostly past at this stage? 'Cause I know you're gonna be shipping more BOS because all I know you guys call it the high band, but historically, it's been called the mid-high band, uses a lot of BOS. Doesn't use a lot of BOS. I mean, you're going into a different product here, so maybe it doesn't, actually. Maybe, maybe you don't even have nearly the number of bands you have to deal with before. So one, underutilization charges, and two, have things improved utilization-wise in BOS, or do you anticipate they'll improve this year?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThanks, Ed. It's, you know, utilization is obviously not where we'd like it to be, so we still have ample headroom, you know, to support some of these strategic areas that we're going after at our largest customer and elsewhere. But, you know, there are no specific underutilization charges or period charges in the quarter. And, you know, the ops team on our side has done a terrific job of managing costs, as we've been, you know, shutting down factories or we've been moving them, you know, from North Carolina to Texas and all of the other activity they have going on that we've discussed. It's a considerable effort, and at the same time, pulling out enough costs in order to support the gross margin improvements that we've been showing is a significant effort.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Analyst)\nOkay. Thanks.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Company Representative)\nThanks, Ed.\n\n**Operator**\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Company Representative)\nI wanna thank everyone for joining us today, and I hope everyone has a great evening.

      "content": "**Operator**\nGood day and welcome to the Qorvo, Inc second quarter 2026 earnings conference call. All participants will be in the listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you press star and then one on your touch-tone phone. To withdraw your question, please press star and then two. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Doug DeLieto, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, and over to you.\n\n**Doug DeLieto** (VP of IR)\nThanks very much. Hello everyone and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2026 second quarter earnings call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.\n\n**Doug DeLieto** (VP of IR)\nDuring our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today, available on our investor relations website at ir.qorvo.com under financial releases. Lastly, for detailed information regarding the Skyworks and Qorvo combination announced on October 28, I encourage you to review the press release, investor presentation, and related materials available on our investor relations website at ir.qorvo.com under events and presentations. Today's call, however, will focus on our fiscal second quarter results as well as our outlook for the December quarter. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Grant Brown, CFO; Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and other members of Qorvo's management team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Doug, and welcome everyone to our call. Qorvo delivered solid operating performance during our fiscal second quarter. I will cover the business strategy driving these results, as well as restructuring actions we are taking to enhance profitability and quarterly strategic achievements. After that, Grant will discuss the financials. Qorvo is sharply focused on our highest performing businesses, and we regularly evaluate each of our investment areas. We have divested or exited businesses that do not meet our financial or strategic objectives, and we continue to do so. We are restructuring CSG to increase our focus on our top opportunities and improve profitability. We are narrowing our focus in ultra-wideband opportunities to automotive, industrial, and enterprise markets, where customer pull for our technologies is increasing, and we are reducing our spend related to mobile and consumer applications, which are more fragmented today.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nWe have consolidated our CSG organizational structure to reflect this increased focus. These actions, coupled with associated cuts in corporate support functions, are expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately $70 million per year in fiscal 2027. In ACG, we're driving a richer mix toward premium and flagship smartphone tiers as we reduce exposure to lower margin mass-tier Android. Our pricing and portfolio actions are ahead of expectations, and now we anticipate lower margin Android revenue to decline by roughly $200 million this fiscal year and by more than $200 million next year. This disciplined approach is improving ACG's profitability as we concentrate on higher value 5G RF content for premium and flagship smartphones that demand more advanced RF performance. Within our factory network, we are also executing on cost and productivity initiatives to reduce capital intensity and structurally enhance gross margin.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nOur manufacturing strategy is to internally produce the most differentiated elements of our products, geographically align production with customer and suppliers, and leverage the scale, capabilities, and cost-effectiveness of our outsourced partners. Over two-thirds of Qorvo's production costs are external. This includes procured raw materials, wafers purchased from external foundries, as well as packaging, assembly, and test operations. Prior actions to optimize our global operations include the sale of our factories in Beijing and Dazhou, China, and the transition of our GaAs wafer production from North Carolina to Oregon. We are on track to close our facility in Costa Rica and transition to external partners. We have begun the process of transferring SAW filter production to our Richardson, Texas. We are on track to shut down the North Carolina facility once the transfer is complete.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nThis positions our factory footprint strategically to manufacture GaAs, GaN, BAW, SAW, and advanced multi-chip modules, all onshore in the United States. This is critical to DNA customers and increasingly a strategic differentiator to customers in other markets. Turning to our quarterly highlights, in ACG, we supported a seasonal ramp during the quarter at our largest customer. We are benefiting from strong unit volumes across existing platforms and greater than 10% year-over-year content growth on the ramping platform. We grew across each of our four primary product categories we supply to our largest customer. They include antenna tuners, high-performance filters and switches, integrated modules, and envelope tracking power management. Within the Android ecosystem, revenue declined sequentially as expected. At our largest Android customer, we supported their second-half flagship launch with a broad set of solutions.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nIn China, ACG sales to China-based Android OEMs were approximately $65 million versus just under $100 million in the prior quarter. In HPA, we supported a broad range of mission-critical defense and aerospace applications, including land, sea, air, and space radar systems, drones, electronic warfare, missile defense, and military and commercial satellite communications. Our leading-edge beamforming technology is helping to modernize defense platforms and satellite terminals, and we are leveraging our advanced capabilities and scale in filtering and RF power to counter evolving enemy jamming capabilities. We expect double-digit year-over-year growth in defense and aerospace markets driven by new platforms, upgrade cycles, RF content, and increases in U.S. and allied defense spending. Qorvo is a strategic supplier to the U.S. government and to U.S. primes, and we enjoy broad exposure to RF content growth opportunities and critical programs such as the proposed Golden Dome multi-layer defense system.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nOutside the U.S., Qorvo is also a beneficiary of increased E.U. and allied defense spending. In power management, we supported the launch of a popular smartwatch that earned media coverage for its broad set of features, including superior fast charging capabilities. We are also a market leader in PMICs for the solid-state drive market and see increasing tailwinds in the data spend portion of our business. We are leveraging the performance advantages of our PMIC and motor control portfolio to expand content in AESA radars, drones, enterprise and AI data centers, smartphones, and wearables. In infrastructure markets, Qorvo is benefiting with the industry's transition to DOCSIS 4.0, where Qorvo is a leading supplier of broadband amplifiers. There also continues to be solid demand for our base station small signal devices.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nIn CSG, we're collaborating with a large automotive tier one to scale ultra-wideband use cases, and our lead program is on track to ramp early next year. We are also supplying ultra-wideband solutions to tier one equipment manufacturers for Wi-Fi 7 network access points. With ultra-wideband integrated into network access points, high-density venues can achieve ultra-precision location awareness. Locations include factories, warehouses, corporate campuses, hospitals, stadiums, and transportation centers. Key applications include indoor navigation, occupancy sensing, asset tracking, and touchless fare transactions. In addition to ultra-wideband, the content opportunity for Qorvo in these access points also includes Wi-Fi front-end and filtering solutions. Wi-Fi 7 is being adopted broadly, given its performance advantages in throughput, latency, efficiency, and network capacity, and Qorvo is supporting broad adoption across routers, mesh networks, and client devices.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nWe are also collaborating with market-leading chipset providers to support the development of Wi-Fi 8 and delivered first samples in the September quarter. Looking across our operating segments, in ACG, we're investing to expand our content opportunity with our largest customer while continuing to serve Android's premium and flagship tiers. In HPA, we're investing to grow our satellite communications, defense and aerospace, and power management businesses, and maintain leadership in infrastructure markets. In CSG, we're targeting growth in network access points and diversification in markets including automotive, enterprise, and industrial. With that, I'll turn it over to Grant.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's fiscal second quarter revenue of $1,059 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 49.7%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings of $2.22 per share all compared favorably to guidance. During the quarter, our largest customer represented approximately 55% of revenue. On the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we held approximately $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding and no near-term maturities. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $605 million. This represents a sequential reduction of $33 million and a decrease of $89 million on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $84 million and incurred $42 million of capital expenditures, which resulted in free cash flow of $42 million. Regarding our outlook for fiscal Q3, our guidance reflects strong execution and demand across multiple end markets.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe are seeing continued momentum in HPA, offset by our exit from lower margin entry-tier Android and the normal seasonal decline at our largest customer heading into December. Our expectations for the December quarter are as follows: revenue of $985 million, ±$50 million. Non-GAAP gross margin between 47%-49%. And non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85, ±$0.20. Gross margin continues to improve on a year-over-year basis. Q2 non-GAAP gross margin increased approximately 270 basis points versus last fiscal year, and Q3 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to increase 150 basis points versus last. At the midpoint. This improvement is a direct result of multiple initiatives. We've actively managed our product portfolio and pricing strategies to reduce exposure to mass-tier Android 5G. We have positioned the company to benefit from growth in DNA, which is margin accretive given the high mix, low-volume nature of the business.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe have divested or exited margin-diluted businesses. And we continue to manage factory costs aggressively while consolidating our manufacturing footprint. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter to be between $255 million-$260 million. The sequential decrease in OpEx reflects lower incentive-based compensation, continued OpEx discipline, and our restructuring efforts within CSG and associated corporate support functions. These actions are included in our December quarter OpEx guidance. Below the operating income line, non-operating expense is expected to be approximately $10 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed-rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2026 is expected to be approximately 15%. We continue to monitor the situation as the specific implementation of the new tax bill in the U.S., as well as changes to international tax policy, may evolve over time.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe are confident the steps we are taking today across our product portfolio, business segments, and manufacturing footprint position the company to expand profitability. The benefits of these strategic initiatives will continue to become evident as we advance through fiscal 2026 and into fiscal 2027. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to reiterate that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our quarterly results and outlook, and we appreciate you keeping your questions focused on these topics. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star and one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star and two. Participants are requested to kindly restrict their questions to one per person, followed by a follow-up question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. We have the first question from the line of Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director of Equity Research in Semiconductors and IT Hardware)\nYes, thank you. It seems like you're now assuming a $200 million headwind from exiting the low end of the China Android market. I think that's a bit more than you previously envisioned of $150 million-$200 million. Could you address why that is the case for this year and next year, and if there's anything else that's happening with respect to the mid-tier market, or if it's just something else? Thank you.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP of Sales and Marketing)\nHey, Karl. This is Dave. I can answer that one. Yeah, so the $200 million decline that Bob mentioned is going to be more weighted towards the back half of the year and even more so in March for a couple of reasons. If you recall, last time we said we gained content in our largest Android customer in their second-half flagship. We will be on the other side of that when we get into March. We also mentioned that we would have lower content this year on their first-half flagship ramp next year. Those two are factors, but the bigger factor is really just the timing of those mass-tier models that we continue to support as we made this pivot in our Android business. Those are now ramping down, and we are not obviously replacing them with new designs heading into next year.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP of Sales and Marketing)\nThat is probably the bigger impact that you are seeing driving that.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director of Equity Research in Semiconductors and IT Hardware)\nGot it. Thanks for that. For my follow-up, how would you rank or the December quarter outlook across HPA, CSG, and ACG? I appreciate some of the initial commentary you gave with respect to the decline of Android and the seasonal decline of Apple. I guess as we look out into HPA from December quarter and into next year, just click on that and see if that, in fact, will be the best-performing segment for December and next year. Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure, Karl. Let me take a stab at it, and then Philip can jump in. Over the course of the year, we do expect our DNA business to continue to increase quarter-over-quarter, just given the seasonal nature of customer order patterns there. We are still expecting that to be the case. We had some very strong growth in that business. On a year-over-year basis, it was over 25%. HPA was up 25% on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter. We feel very strongly that that is a very high-performing area from a growth perspective.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (President of Infrastructure and Defense Products)\nYeah, I would add, so outside of DNA, we're also seeing quite a bit of strength in our infrastructure business. In our broadband business, as we've talked about, DOCSIS 4.0 continues to roll out. Really, really strong ramp that we see continuing throughout this year and into next year as well. In our base station business, kind of our core base station business that goes into kind of the radios and stuff, that's doing well. We're really seeing a proliferation of those products into some new markets that we're excited about. The first is drones. Both two-way and one-way drones are using both 4G and 5G products as one of their communication paths. We're seeing strength this year, this quarter, next quarter, and into next year for that. Also, if you think about it, as you look at these direct-to-cell satellites, really, they're base stations in the sky.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (President of Infrastructure and Defense Products)\nWe're seeing the same products that we use here, terrestrial, going up into space into these applications. We expect that to continue, and that's why we're pretty optimistic about double-digit growth going into next year as well.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director of Equity Research in Semiconductors and IT Hardware)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nYes, thanks. Good evening. I guess the first question is, in light of some of what you're saying about some of the Android decline weighted through the March quarter, what should we think with regard to March quarter seasonality? What do you consider normal seasonality to be, and what are the factors that we should consider when comparing to normal seasonality this year?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. Hey, Chris. This is Grant. Let me take that one. We're not guiding Q4 or the full year at this time, but we're encouraged by the strength that we saw in the first half. We're mindful of the typical seasonality, as you mentioned, in the back half, where we see our largest customer ramping down typically in the March and June periods. As we pivot away from some of the lower-margin Android business, as Dave pointed out earlier, it would be especially impactful in fiscal Q4. That said, we are executing on our strategy to focus on driving meaningful productivity improvements. From our standpoint, we're executing that strategy. We're focusing on the premium flagship tiers, and this is something you're starting to see in our gross margin profile. I mean, we've committed to hitting high 40s, and we're doing just that.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe're getting very close to 50 points of gross margin in a seasonally strong quarter. We're hard at work executing on profitability and executing to our strategy to pivot away from Android. Low-tier Android, excuse me.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nRight. You mentioned gross margins, and that was going to be my follow-up. There are a lot of moving parts as we go into next year. There are still some things you're doing with the factories in order to drive efficiency, but you said that I imagine the mix gets better as you exit some of the low-tier Android. How does that result in gross margins? What are the puts and takes we should think about for gross margins next year?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nI'm sorry, you're breaking up. Can you repeat the end of your question?\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nOh, just in terms of what we should expect, the puts and takes on gross margins for next year.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. The business mix is one of them. It'll be meaningfully helpful for us as we see HPA and defense aerospace and other areas grow as a percentage of our total top line. That's very impactful. Then product mix within the segments, especially ACG, where we have already communicated our exit from the low-tier Android area, so the premium and flagship products there. In terms of that portfolio, we'll be helping from a mix standpoint. The factory actions that we're executing on, bringing more volume to our other locations, also helps significantly. We've talked through Costa Rica, and the closure there is on track. The transfer of our SAW capacity from Greensboro to Texas is also on track, and we would expect that to be beyond fiscal 2027.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nI think all the other cost reduction efforts that we're doing, the standard blocking and tackling, yield improvements, cost downs, and all the other things are more standard activities, are all on target.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah, hey, guys. First of all, really good results. Maybe Grant, one for you. In your guidance, I'm looking at your margins versus what you just delivered for the September quarter. I would have thought that your margins would not be down quite the way they're guiding to. I guess I'm curious if it's just revenues that are driving this, or is there other factors in play? Because you've got a lot of positives going on in the margin structure as well that fundamentally that you're driving to. I just want to understand the factors driving the margin for the December quarter guidance.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. It's generally the case that as we're ramping down and as we start to see that happen in the December quarter, as we head into March, the utilization tends to lead the revenue there. We're seeing some of that. It's not untypical or atypical. I would say that the margin performance is still substantially improved on a year-over-year basis. Even on the revenue basis that we've been guiding to, you can see that impact. My view is it's strong improvement, and we'd expect that to continue as we move through fiscal 2026 and into 2027. I wouldn't read anything too meaningful into any of the subtle variation from a quarter-to-quarter basis other than generally the mix.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst)\nOkay. And then maybe one for Bob. Bob, on aerospace and defense, you have got some pretty large goals, but you are also doing really well. We know the market is healthy. Maybe help us understand two things. One, what is the scale right now? How big is this business right now? You mentioned it is up 25% year on year, but just in absolute dollars, if you can. And then specifically right now, what kind of technologies and applications are working for Qorvo to drive that revenue growth?\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Harsh. It is hard for me to contain Philip when it comes to this. I am just going to let him go ahead and talk and find that little color. I appreciate the question on the defense business. As you said, it is doing fantastic, and they are producing great products and really doing an extremely good job. Philip.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (President of Infrastructure and Defense Products)\nYeah. Harsh, I would say that we've sized it publicly before. I would say kind of mid-400s and growing. I think we had commented in our last call that we had a funnel, and it is continuing to grow. It actually grew another $2 billion in the funnel over this quarter alone. Really, where we're seeing the applications, they're pretty broad-based. It is maybe a long answer to your question, but I'll try to kind of hit some of the highlights. One of the areas that we're really seeing is the U.S. is looking at how do you build new capabilities both in drones, which require a lot of different kinds of technologies, both radar and comms. There is a whole lot of more and better RF that's needed to scale that up.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (President of Infrastructure and Defense Products)\nThe other area is in electronic warfare, where we're looking to come up with new ways to drive spectrum dominance in that area. In electronic warfare, one area that is really growing rapidly is the use of solid-state PAs to be able to do more direct-energy-type defensive and offensive applications. That is a sweet spot for our technology. There is just a tremendous amount of opportunity there. In addition to that, I would say in our core markets, core markets in defense and aerospace is really the radar-based platforms. Whether that's land, sea, air, we are seeing a whole new set of capability needs that are what the U.S. government calls an urgent need. It really fits into the sweet spot of what we do. You add a layer on top of that.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (President of Infrastructure and Defense Products)\nIf you look at Golden Dome and what they're trying to do in any kind of missile defense system, you're going to need land-based assets. You're going to need air-based assets. You're going to need space-based assets. All of those platforms that they're looking at, we are in those platforms. That will be a tailwind for us as well. It is really broad-based. I can't just pick one that is driving it. We're seeing a lot of tailwinds. Especially because I think I would add, as the administration has really started to become very clear on what their priorities are. Those priorities really do fit with what we're doing. That doesn't even include what's happening on the NATO side in Europe as they increase their defense budgets up to 3.5% of GDP. Again, lots of positive things that are happening.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you so much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst of Semiconductors)\nHi. Thanks so much for the question. I guess as we think about 2027, are we still thinking about mid-single digit or are we thinking about growth overall for ACG? Additionally, you have talked increasingly about integrated modules. Would love an update there on your capabilities, your differentiation, and the likelihood you think you get some new sockets here. That'd be great.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nYeah, sure, Chris. Let me take the first part, and then Frank can jump in. Obviously really excited about our technology, but it's too early to comment on fiscal 2027 at this point. We won't be making any commentary there at this point in the game. We'll have more to talk about probably as the year advances. Frank, comment on integrated modules.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (SVP and President of Advanced Cellular Groups)\nYeah. Hey, Chris. Similar feedback with respect to things that are already discussed. We're too early to say at this time. We're working very hard on product development, not just for next year, but for the next three years. I do want to say I'm really proud of the ACG team and all the work they're doing.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst of Semiconductors)\nGreat. Thanks for that. As we talk about the merger, are there still any opportunities? Would you consider any merger opportunities, even tuck-ins, any acquisitions from that standpoint, any divestitures, any buybacks, any OpEx changes, or any footprint consolidation beyond what you've already announced? Should we just kind of think steady state Qorvo until all the approvals and the merger is done?\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Appreciate the question. I think what's most important is we also have to keep in mind that we are going to be running separate and independent companies. There is latitude in our agreements for us to make changes and do things that we want to be able to do. You got to remember, we're running these as separate companies.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst of Semiconductors)\nYep. Okay. I think that answers it. Thanks, Bob.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director of Semiconductor Equipment and IT Hardware)\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them on mobile. First one for Bob. Can you give an update on your progress with your biggest customer on the mid-to-high band path? It seems like that's a big opportunity. Is there any way to figure out how that's progressing and when we should start seeing some results or any timeline for that? I had a follow-up.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Appreciate the question. You can imagine that's a topic that we just can't cover and comment about where we're at. I think Frank's already said how proud he is of the team and how well they're executing. Time will tell and patience, please.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director of Semiconductor Equipment and IT Hardware)\nFair enough. Fair enough. All right. Then a follow-up. Post-exiting the lower-tier Android, how should we think about your Android and China exposure? Are you still chasing 15%-20% of the Android market today? How to think about how it is still sitting China and your big non-China Android customer? I think you kind of commented a little bit on March quarter. I am just wondering, besides the lower-tier Android in March and seasonality, are there any idiosyncratic things you had to worry about in March quarter? Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. We still feel very strongly about our strategy to pursue the premium and flagship tiers of Android, right? They're going to have a product portfolio, and they're going to compete against other devices in that segment. They're going to need to use premium-performing parts. That is where the majority of the TAM and SAM is for us in the ACG side. We feel very well positioned. We're going to continue to support our Android customers. We have been very successful at exiting some of the less attractive areas there, as Bob commented on in his prepared remarks. It is a little bit difficult to comment on share specific to one quarter, given the ramp timing of all the different models in the Android ecosystem.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director of Semiconductor Equipment and IT Hardware)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nGood evening. Thanks for taking my question. On the HPA business, I'm wondering if you're seeing any kind of cyclical effects outside of the normal kind of secular growth in those product lines. What are your customers telling you in terms of inventory levels, willingness to restock, or anything else from a supply chain or cyclical point of view? Thank you.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (President of Infrastructure and Defense Products)\nThis is Philip. I would say channel inventory is healthy. We're not seeing any kind of unusual order patterns. I would say more on the we're starting to get requests for, \"Hey, we need delivery sooner,\" rather than.\n\n**Operator**\nCan the management hear us? Hello? Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a challenge with the management line. Please stay connected as we reconnect the management. Who is answering? Over to the management.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (President of Infrastructure and Defense Products)\nSorry. We're back. Thank you. All right. The question, I think, was around HPA and channel inventory. What I was saying was we don't see any kind of excessive channel inventory. In fact, we see more kind of expedite ask than we do channel or push outs or anything like that. I'd say the channel is healthy. One area I would also maybe highlight is we are seeing really strong bookings and backlog in our power management business surrounded around the data center side for solid-state drives. That would be one area where also don't see any inventory challenges, but we're seeing expedite requests.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nThat's helpful. Thanks. Maybe as a quick follow-up, as a housekeeping question, maybe color on your guidance by segment, your expectations heading into the December quarter. Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nYeah. Thanks for the question. We don't judge by segment.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Hey, guys. Just a couple of housekeeping questions. Were there any underutilization charges, especially regarding Oregon? What's your feeling on those for, obviously, if you're going to be seasonally down in the next couple of quarters because your largest customers, you're probably going to be burdened more. Just as a starting point, can we get color on that?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nYeah. Hey, Ed. This is Grant. No period-related charges associated with underutilization. It's just the normal loadings are generating factory variances within the normal bands, and that applies to product costing. Nothing from a period charge perspective that would create an abnormal utilization charge.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nOkay. I'm just trying to get a feel for how much capacity you have both in GaAs in Oregon and then BAW in Texas. I know you haven't been notified yet on anything that would occur next week, your largest customer next week, next year at your largest customer. I know it depends on share if you do win, etc., but I'm just trying to get a feel for what kind of CapEx you might be facing, if any, especially regarding GaAs. Because most of your product wins aren't really GaAs-intensive. You've got a lot of antenna tuners. You've got less SOI, etc. I'm just trying to get a feel for where you sit in capacity in GaAs and BAW.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think first I want to say the team's done a fantastic job in both GaAs as well as in the filters, BAW filters in particular, in shrinking sizes. As we ramp new technologies, typically we're reducing the size so we don't have to add a lot of capacity to meet the same demand. The team's done a fantastic job there. I think as we look at the outlook for next year, we do expect we'll spend money for expanding capacities and bringing in new technologies. I think it's going to be less than what we spent this year. Again, I think people underestimate the tremendous work the team has done in reducing die sizes as we release new process technologies. I think we're in good shape to support a lot of business.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nYeah. Maybe, Ed, I would just further Bob's comments. Obviously, you know, I mean, in order to compete for business, you have to have an ample amount of capacity in place in advance. We wouldn't be targeting business we don't think we could support with our existing capacity.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nWe also have to ramp down to the Android business as well, which frees up capacity. So we're in a pretty good place.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nVery good. That's what I was looking for. Thanks, guys.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Peter Peng from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n**Peter Peng** (VP of Equity Research)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the content growth of about 10%+ for the last, for the most recent generation, you mentioned that all of your four major products grew on a content-wise year-over-year. Maybe if you can just give us a sense of contribution from these product groups.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nHey, Peter. Thanks for the question. We have not actually commented, I mean, on each of the four different categories of revenue at our largest customer and which was contributing to the growth, other than to say that we are seeing growth in all categories.\n\n**Peter Peng** (VP of Equity Research)\nGot it. Okay. For my follow-up, I think last quarter, you guys talked about the CSG being able to grow low single digits. Just given some of the restructuring initiatives, what's the current expectation for this business group?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. CSG, as we commented last quarter, had experienced the push-out of a large award in our ultra-wideband business. That is still the case. There's no change there. In terms of growth, there would be some impact, but relatively marginal due to the restructuring activities. You could see a roughly flat, perhaps, year for CSG, plus or minus.\n\n**Peter Peng** (VP of Equity Research)\nThank you, guys.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management for any closing remarks.\n\n**Bob Bruggeworth** (President and CEO)\nI want to thank everyone for joining us tonight and hope everyone has a great evening. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.\n\n**Operator**\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Douglas Delito, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Doug DeLieto** (VP - IR)\nThanks very much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal twenty twenty first quarter earnings call. This call will include forward looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business and our annual report on Form 10 ks filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non GAAP financial results.\n\n**Doug DeLieto** (VP - IR)\nWe provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website @ir.corvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO Grant Brown, Chief Financial Officer Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing Philip Chesley, President of High Performance Analog Eric Crevison, President of our Connectivity and Sensors Group Frank Stewart, President of our Advanced Cellular Group as well as other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nThanks, Doug. Welcome, everyone, to our call. Qorvo delivered a strong 2026 with notable achievements across our three operating segments. Beginning with ACG, we continue to leverage the breadth and performance advantages of our cellular product portfolio. For our largest customer, we supply four categories of highly differentiated products.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nThey are antenna tuners, high performance filters and switches, integrated modules, and envelope tracking power management. Qorvo's envelope tracking PMIC for this customer has been custom developed to pair with their internal baseband, and this represents a durable multi year content opportunity. In HPA, our growth investments are in defense and aerospace and power management. Defense and aerospace is HPA's largest market by revenue, and we expect durable year over year growth in D and A supported by increases in U. S.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd allied defense spending. In power management, we are leveraging our leadership in PMICs and motor control to diversify across markets, including consumer, defense and aerospace, industrial and enterprise, and mobile. Growth applications include enterprise and AI data centers, wearables, drones, robotics, smartphones, and advanced power management solutions for AESA radars. In CSG, we supported Wi Fi access points and flagship smartphones with Wi Fi seven front ends, while also aligning with market leading chipset providers to develop next generation solutions for Wi Fi eight. CSG is also leveraging our ultra wideband and matter portfolio to scale new use cases and diversify revenue.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nUltra wideband is our third largest investment area, providing Qorvo a significant long term opportunity for diversification and growth as applications proliferate. We are engaged broadly across markets and maintain a robust ultra wideband sales funnel with over $2,000,000,000 of qualified opportunities. Now turning to strategic highlights by market. In the automotive market, Qorvo's ultra wideband technology enables a range of automotive use cases, such as secure access using smartphones and smartwatches, in addition to key fobs, as well as precision short range radar applications, including child presence detection, hands free liftgate access, and intrusion detection. During the quarter, Qorvo was awarded an ultra wideband design win for a leading automotive OEM based in Japan and secured an ultra wideband win in support of the world's leading EV manufacturer.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nFor automotive asset tracking, we were selected to supply ultra wideband tags for an automotive OEM based in South Korea. These tags enable the OEM to enhance operational efficiencies as cars are manufactured and transported. In consumer markets, we secured a Wi Fi seven design win in augmented reality glasses. This is a growth category, and Qorvo is also supplying Wi Fi six and Wi Fi seven FEMs for a leading supplier of AR glasses and VR goggles to a company headquartered in The U. S.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nDuring the defense and aerospace markets, Qorvo's opportunity set continues to expand. Our sales funnel increased approximately 2,000,000,000 sequentially to over $7,000,000,000 This growth reflects a sharp increase in both U. S. And international defense spending and Qorvo's expanding position in high priority programs. Recent U.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nS. Budget reconciliation legislation includes approximately $150,000,000,000 in additional U. S. Defense funding. This is an incremental tailwind to revenue given Qorvo's strategic importance to the DoD and leading defense primes.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nWe are actively engaged across a broad range of advanced programs, including radar, comms, SATCOM, and missile defense, and we stand to benefit from initiatives such as the Golden Dome multilayer defense system. We are also a beneficiary in increased EU and allied defense funding in ground, airborne, ship, and space based sensing platforms. Purvo is uniquely positioned in this market. We offer gas, GaN, BAW, SAW, and advanced multi chip packaging, all manufactured onshore in The US. These capabilities, coupled with our silicon beamforming technology, are critical enablers for modernizing defense platforms.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nBy integrating these core technologies, Qorvo is able to enhance system level performance, reduce size and weight, and deliver greater value across increasingly complex architectures. During the quarter, we supported a broad range of mission critical applications, including manned and unmanned airborne radar, space based radar, SATCOM, electronic warfare, and missile defense. To address increasing requirements for functional density and efficiency, we introduced two highly integrated S band switch filter bank modules, leveraging BAW and SOI technologies. Additionally, we expanded our SATCOM portfolio with a new GaN based K band power amplifier that delivers superior levels of integration, bandwidth, and power efficiency to meet the needs of next generation LEO constellations. In industrial and enterprise markets, Qorvo enabled the demonstration of breakthrough new enterprise networking applications with a leading Tier one equipment manufacturer.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nWe've engaged with this customer and other Tier one equipment manufacturers for a number of years to incorporate Qorvo's ultra wideband solutions into their network access points. These access points have already begun to shift to end customers as part of their Wi Fi seven deployments. This enables a range of ultra precise applications such as indoor navigation, location awareness, and asset tracking that deliver superior real time location accuracy in high density venues such as factories, warehouses, offices, airports, hospitals, campuses, retail locations, and stadiums. In addition to this ultra wideband engagement, Qorvo supports this customer's enterprise ecosystem with Wi Fi seven front end and filtering solutions. Turning to infrastructure, there's strong momentum in DOCSIS four point zero broadband cable access.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nQorvo is a market leader, and we are well aligned with industry leaders in the continuing evolution of DOCSIS standards and capabilities. During the June, we released two new GaN based power doubler amplifiers supporting the industry's transition to more intelligent and adaptive hybrid fiber coax systems. For the base station market, we sampled key customers' new solutions, including high efficiency pre driver and high rejection BAW filter. Qorvo's newest small signal solutions offer higher performance and tighter integration for massive MIMO, fixed wireless access and other five gs deployments. In the mobile market, we are investing to increase our content opportunity at our largest customer in future programs over multiple years.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nWe've expanded our portfolio for this customer with ET power management, and we expect to achieve greater than 10% contact growth in this year's fall launch compared to last year's fall launch. At our second largest customer, our solutions span our smartphone portfolio. Content this year includes low band pads, mid high band pads, and ultra high band pads, as well as mid high secondary transmit, antenna tuning, discrete filters, and Wi Fi seven FEMs. We also supported the ramp of multiple smartphone models by an Android OEM based in North America. Qorvo supports this customer with multiple high value placements across product categories.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nFor Android OEMs based in China, shipments increased sequentially during the quarter as expected and in line with seasonal ramp profile of five gs smartphones. We continue to supply mid tier design wins awarded prior to our pivot from lower margin Android five gs. However, five gs product development in ACG now targets the premium and flagship tiers. During the quarter, we secured multiple Wi Fi seven design wins across leading Android smartphone OEMs using MediaTek's Dimensity chipset. These wins are concentrated in the flagship and premium tiers, and we are engaged to support Wi Fi eight deployments in the upper tiers of the Android smartphones as early as the 2026.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nLooking across our operating segments, we're expanding our content opportunity in ACG with our largest customer, while diversifying across markets, customers, and product categories in HBA and CSG. We are operating the business with discipline and continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize costs. Where businesses do not meet our financial or strategic objectives, we will continue to act decisively, whether through divestiture or exit, to focus our resources on core high performing areas. Since last year, we have exited base station PAMs, divested our silicon carbide business, pivoted from legacy Android programs, ramped higher value product categories, begun a sales process related to our MEMS Force Sensing business, and pursued a broad set of actions to optimize our global factory network. Most recently, we transitioned gas wafer production from our Greensboro, North Carolina fab to our Hillsboro, Oregon fab.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nOn last quarter's call, we announced our intent to close our facility in Costa Rica. The closure is on track and will occur in 2026, providing an additional tailwind to margin when complete. To build on this, today we are announcing the closure of our Greensboro fab and transfer of our saw filter production to our Richardson, Texas fab. In his remarks, Grant will provide additional information on this, including timing and savings. We want to thank all the employees who are supporting us through this closure to make sure it's a seamless transition for our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Grant.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's fiscal first quarter revenue of $819,000,000 non GAAP gross margin of 44% and non GAAP diluted earnings of $0.92 per share all compared favorably to guidance. During the quarter, our largest customer represented approximately 41% of revenue. On the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we held approximately $1,200,000,000 in cash and equivalents.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nWe currently have approximately $1,500,000,000 of long term debt outstanding and no near term maturities. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $638,000,000 This represents a slight sequential reduction and a decrease of $89,000,000 on a year over year basis. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $183,000,000 and incurred $38,000,000 of CapEx, which resulted in free cash flow of $145,000,000 From an operational perspective, the closure of our Costa Rica site remains on track and we anticipate a smooth transition. We continue to expect this action will be completed early next calendar year as we move production and complete the sale of the facilities. As Bob mentioned, we have also decided to close our manufacturing facility in North Carolina to further consolidate our internal factory footprint.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThe closure of a wafer fab requires more time than the closure of a packaging, assembly and test location, and we currently expect the associated cost efficiencies to benefit non GAAP gross margin beginning late in fiscal twenty twenty seven. In order to transfer our soft filter production out of North Carolina, we have begun to bring up a new production line in our Texas location and we'll be working closely with customers to ensure a seamless transition. For modeling purposes, shutdown and restructuring activities such as those related to the closure of our North Carolina and Costa Rica sites are excluded from non GAAP results. Conversely, the operating expenses associated with bringing up a new line as is the case with the SAW line in Texas are included in non GAAP results. In fiscal twenty twenty six, we expect non GAAP OpEx related to the startup costs for the Texas SAW line of 10,000,000 to $20,000,000 with minimal expense continuing into fiscal twenty twenty seven.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSubject to factory volume and mix, we expect the annual savings in non GAAP COGS for each year after the new line goes live will exceed the one time startup costs incurred in fiscal twenty twenty six. Regarding our outlook for fiscal Q2, our guidance reflects strong execution and demand across multiple end markets, while factoring in our current views on macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics. Our expectations for the September are as follows: revenue of $1,025,000,000 plus or minus $50,000,000 non GAAP gross margin between 4850% and non GAAP diluted EPS of $2 plus or minus $0.25 The momentum we are seeing in both revenue and bookings is being driven primarily by robust underlying demand and meaningful content expansion. At our largest customer, we continue to benefit from strong unit volumes across the existing platforms and more than 10% year over year content growth on the ramping platform. Growth in our Defense and Aerospace business is supported by increasing content and rising defense spending, both domestically and internationally.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nAdditionally, our infrastructure business is benefiting from the industry's transition to DOCSIS four point zero, where Qorvo is a leading supplier of broadband amplifiers. These drivers are being partially offset as we continue to shift away from lower margin mass tier Android five gs business, which is proceeding as planned. In the June, ACG's Android revenue declined 18% year over year to approximately $240,000,000 with China based Android revenue down 29% year over year to just under $100,000,000 While we've seen limited tariff related inventory buffering at a few customers, we believe these effects are modest and secondary to the underlying demand drivers and Qorvo specific content growth reflected in our outlook. Gross margin continues to improve on a year over year basis. Q1 non GAAP gross margin increased approximately 300 basis points versus last fiscal year and Q2 non GAAP gross margin is expected to increase 200 basis points versus last fiscal year at the midpoint.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThis improvement is a direct result of multiple initiatives. We've actively managed our product portfolio and pricing strategies to reduce our exposure to mass tier Android five gs. We have positioned the company to benefit from growth in DNA, which is margin accretive given the high mix, low volume nature of the business. We've divested or exited margin dilutive businesses. And finally, we continue to manage manufacturing costs aggressively while consolidating our factory footprint.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nWe project non GAAP operating expenses in the September to be approximately $265,000,000 plus or minus 3%. The sequential increase in OpEx reflects higher incentive based compensation given the expected outperformance during the first half of the fiscal year, FX headwinds related to the weak U. S. Dollar and the impact of tariffs. Total OpEx also includes other operating expense of $5,000,000 associated with the startup of our soft filter line in Texas among other items.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nBelow the operating income line, non operating expense is expected to be approximately $10,000,000 reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses along with other items. Our non GAAP tax rate for fiscal twenty twenty six is now expected to be approximately 15%. This is down from between 18% to 19% as was previously communicated. We continue to monitor the situation as the specific implementation of the new tax bill in The U. S.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nAs well as changes to international tax policy may evolve over time. On the corporate development front, we continue to seek strategic alternatives for our MEMS Force Sensing business, which is incurring approximately $5,000,000 of non GAAP OpEx per quarter. We remain committed to optimizing our portfolio and regularly evaluating each of our investment areas. We're confident the steps we're taking today across our product portfolio, business segments and manufacturing footprint position the company to expand profitability. The benefits of these strategic initiatives will continue to become evident as we advance through fiscal twenty twenty six and into fiscal twenty twenty seven.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nAt this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, then 2. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. If you have further questions, you may reenter the question queue.\n\n**Operator**\nThe first question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice results. So I just want to start off with the seasonality of this year. It looks like things are tracking kind of relatively in line with 2024 in the June quarter. You look at the remainder of the year, you guys had previously kind of talked about the largest customer kind of being flat to slightly up modestly, but you're kind of reiterating this view that there's double digit growth in content fall launch over fall launch.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nCould you talk about the disconnect there? And is December kind of normal seasonal, which gets you to that kind of goal? Just help me understand the seasonality as it compares to last year, just given the strong content up year over year. Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nHey, Tom, this is Grant. Thank you for the question. Let me start off maybe just with the December question and then I'll get to the full year. In December, typically seasonality would show that we ship a little bit earlier into the fall ramp. So we would generally see a September quarter that's slightly higher than December.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThere's no change this year to what we believe the ramp profile would look like. Again, it really depends on how things play out unit wise, but in terms of the full fiscal twenty six year, the last time we provided a full year guidance was in January and that was prior to the increase in any macroeconomic uncertainty around the tariff dynamics. At that time, January forecast called for 2026 revenue to be roughly flat with fiscal twenty twenty five, excluding the $30,000,000 of revenue from silicon carbide, we've since divested that was in fiscal twenty twenty five. At this time, we're not updating our full year at this stage, but I can walk through some puts and takes by business segment beyond just ACG. But in ACG, outlook is still for a single digit decline and that's unchanged.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nWe remain on track to exit the 150,000,000 to $200,000,000 of low margin business as part of our strategic portfolio shift there in Android five gs. And we currently expect about two thirds of that year over year decline in the Android business will occur in the 2025. So that's yet to come in the second half, which gets to at least partially addressing your December question. Largest At customer, we remain encouraged by the recent strength and we're seeing unit volumes there on existing platforms come in to our expectations and strong as well as the content gain that we see of 10% or more on the ramping platform, which is encouraging. In some of the changes we've seen in terms of the top line for fiscal twenty twenty six are in CSG, which is trending below our earlier expectations due in part to automotive customer delaying a program ramp there that included our ultra wideband SoC.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThat program is now anticipated to ramp in fiscal twenty twenty seven. So we continue to expect year over year growth for CSG. However, it'll be in the low single digits versus 10% to 12% as we guided previously. And then lastly, our expectations for HPA remain unchanged and on track for a strong double digit growth this year. In D and A, rebound in infrastructure tied to the DOCSIS upgrades and some other positive tailwinds we can get into.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nWhile we're encouraged by the first half strength that we've seen, we're also mindful of the seasonality in smartphones in the back half as we shift the portfolio away from mass tier Android, but overall, we remain very confident in the strategy, the execution our strong strategic position.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nSuper helpful. Thank you. And then just to dive down onto the Android point there. So you gave a little extra color this quarter, talking about Android and like the $240,000,000 range. That's up 16% sequentially by my numbers, maybe give or take where people have March set up.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nBut, you guys have previously said kind of up slightly. Is that dynamic something that you think is more of a pull forward? Or do you think that's customers kind of coming to you, hey, you're exiting the business. This is the end of the life here. We want to take a couple more products before you're done producing. Just maybe explain the dynamic there and what happened versus your original expectations.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nThis is Dave. I'll take that one. So yeah, I mean, you look at the Android ecosystem, we've customers in China as well as globally and in the premium tier, remember we're not exiting that part of the market. So we talked I think last time about some share gains that we have in the second half at our large Korean customer. And so we're starting to see the benefit of that as that starts to ramp up.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nWe've also got really good content in a U. S. Customer that Bob mentioned in his prepared remarks, And that's ramping now as well. So I think that's some of the dynamics you're seeing. We talked about China a little bit earlier and we do see a little bit of buffering probably there with some of the uncertainty in the trade dynamics.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nAnd so there's probably a little bit of that going on in China. But we've still got engagements there in the high tier, but that business is definitely declining as we head into the back half of the year.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nHey, guys. Also wanted to echo my congratulations. These are extremely great and awesome results. I had two as well. I think you're moving to the 50% or 48 to 50% gross margin mark a lot faster than I think I had anticipated personally.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nAnd I was curious, you've got a bunch of things going on. You're exiting businesses. You're doing fab rationalization. But but if you were to say which of those initiatives have probably the maximum amount of swing factor that's driving your margins up so much higher, Maybe I'll be very curious to understand what's making the margins go up so much faster if there's one that's more impactful than the other? And I've got a follow-up.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSure, Harsh. Thanks for the question. If you look at gross margin, at least in Q1, the driver there sequentially is largely mixed, but on a year over year basis, it's up largely due to cost improvements. You'll see that we've taken some significant actions on the factory footprint, some of yet to come, but a number of them in terms of reducing costs, you're starting to see in gross margin. There's also an improvement in mix.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nWe've seen growth in the defense and aerospace area, which helps from a business mix perspective. And we've also exited the silicon carbide business, which was dragging against our gross margin profile. And finally, we've moved our WiFi business from an underloaded North Carolina fab to an Oregon fab that's higher volumes and we're seeing a benefit there. So I would say that the single largest theme in terms of gross margin improvement is both cost reductions and the other actions we've taken.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nOkay, and I assume that applies to September as well?\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nYes, that's a continuation a lot of the same trends.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nGot it. And then for my follow-up, you talked a lot about increased content, but you're seeing on the internal modem, but I wanted to ask about the mid high pad. I believe you are a legit supplier in the Android ecosystem of that pad. And I think from my understanding, you have a window at a large US customer. Is am I to assume with the kind of growth that you're talking about in your in your content that you have a shot at it or you won something or maybe there's contribution there or is it just the internal modem proliferating through the ecosystem of phone models?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nHarsh, this is Bob. I'll take that. So for this fall's launch, the team did a great job of delivering dollar content growth that both Grant and I talked about over 10%. But as far as next year's phone, which is where I think you're heading, we do remain confident in our position with our largest customer. But there are two factors that we consider when we look at the business there.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nOne is tech, but one is commercial. In terms of technical, the technology that we're delivering and our product development we've done, we're delivering results and we're laser focused on an execution. So I like how the team is progressing there. Commercially, with the expiration of a certain long term supply agreement, that's also helping us. And as we've looked and we've talked about this before, the expansion of their SKUs where they launched the 16E, which to your point, we did have ET PMIC on the internal modem, these all create opportunities for us.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nSo we think we positioned the business nicely, but we'll see how it all plays out next year.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question is from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst - Semiconducters)\nHey, thanks for the question and really great results here. So I guess first of all, following up on the gross margin progress, so this is probably for Grant here. So you guys did mention you could hit high 40s this year and you're going to do that, looks like, but you mentioned you could hit 50% next year. I was wondering if maybe we could get an update there. And as we look forward into next year, perhaps you can walk us, give us a gross margin walk, what's contributing to what in terms of that improvement? Thanks.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSure, Chris. This is Grant. Let take that one. As we look forward beyond fiscal twenty twenty six, they're largely the initiatives that we've discussed, the Costa Rica and North Carolina closures and we'll be moving into fabs that will be more heavily loaded. So that'll be beneficial.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nWe'll be changing the business mix and we'll have growth in D and A above our corporate average. So that'll be margin accretive. We're laser focused on reducing costs. It's an ongoing activity and we'll be able to benefit from that. But in terms of giving any guidance out into fiscal twenty twenty seven, other than to say we expect gross margin to continue to improve, I won't be providing any incremental guidance today.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nIn terms of walking the overall fiscal 'twenty six improvement, the vast majority of it, as I mentioned, was really cost related and due to the factory actions that we had taken previously. There is some inventory improvement there, better excess obsolete, better quality and yields, other items, but for the most part, the lion's share of the improvement is a direct result of those factory and actions and business growth we're seeing in margin accretive areas because of the capital we're allocating to those businesses.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst - Semiconducters)\nOkay, thank you for that. Just a clarification and then another question, I apologize. But it sounds like it's like $15,000,000 a year, if I got that right from those fab rationalizations there, which is a little under 1%, if you just confirm that I got that math right. And then the second question is actually for Bob. So Bob, you did better than expected for June and September, it seems like here.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst - Semiconducters)\nAny idea on how much, particularly your largest customer, was pulled in? And Qualcomm has talked about an expectation of 30% internal modem at your largest customer. Is that your expectation as well in the September guidance? Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nMaybe let me start Chris with the first part of your question and then I'll let Dave or Bob respond. The $15,000,000 would be relevant for the North Carolina We said it'd be between 10,000,000 and $20,000,000 of cost in fiscal twenty twenty six in order to bring up the saw line in our Texas location and that we would benefit at least that much every year thereafter once the line goes live. So I would say that's on the low side and likely related simply to the North Carolina facility.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nAnd Chris, as far as architecture is doing, our largest customer will stick with our standard line though, we're not going to comment on that. But clearly, is our expectations over time that they will use more of their internal modem and the percentage will only grow. Dave, you want to take the other part he asked?\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nYes, sure. Hey, Chris. Yes, as far as your question about pooling demand, I mean the strength we're seeing is primarily driven by the underlying demand fundamentals we mentioned in the prepared remarks around unit strength and content gains and smartphones as well as increased spending and expanding content and defense and the broadband infrastructure upgrades. So those are the major drivers. Outside of handsets, we're not seeing any pull in activity, channel inventories are healthy and customer behavior supports normal demand patterns.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nIn fact, some areas we're seeing the opposite that we do believe is related to tariffs and especially our motor control business for power tools and garden equipment. We're starting to demand push out just because of the uncertainty around the tariffs and trade policy concerns there. In handsets, we're benefiting from the seasonal ramp we talked about and further supported by some of the content gains, not only our largest customer, but mentioned Samsung as well and others. But we have seen some limited component inventory buffering due to the tariff dynamics, mostly in Android and some of that's associated with factory optimization as our customers try and optimize their factory footprints to the different geographies they're shipping to. So we estimate that to be in the range of about 15,000,000 to $30,000,000 of added buffer that could be out there and we expect that will be reduced back down to normal throughout the rest of the calendar year.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nHaving said that, we're projecting our China Android business will be down sequentially about 30,000,000 to $40,000,000 in this quarter and then down again in our fiscal Q3. So all of that's contemplated in our guidance. And we continue to monitor these dynamics closely and we're going to continue to take disciplined and conservative approach to the back half of the fiscal year. And I just do want to point out we haven't changed our internal smartphone unit assumptions that we started the year with. So we're kind of maintaining our position there as well.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**James Schneider** (Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment a little bit on the defense business. Clearly, it seems like it's tracking a little bit better than what you expected. Can you maybe talk about whether the step down was less than you expected in the quarter?\n\n**James Schneider** (Analyst)\nHow much you expect the defense vertical to be up specifically in September? And then maybe as a separate follow on, can you maybe sort of address the M and A potential specifically in that defense area that you see out there in the market? Do you see more or less opportunities in that vertical? And maybe kind of talk about the price or valuation environment you see for both defense and broader HPA acquisitions. Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSure, why don't we let Philip, you want to cover the business and then I can talk to the M and A environment?\n\n**Philip Chesley** (SVP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nYeah, sure. So I think the strength that we're seeing is not, I mean, it's not different than what we had forecasted. You know, I think as Bob mentioned, you know, we're seeing really just our design opportunities and our funnel grow significantly. Think Bob mentioned that we had increased it by over $2,000,000,000 in a quarter. You know, are really critical in most comm radar satellite, Satcom systems with the US government. And I think you know what we're seeing is, you know, when the administration first came in, there was a lot of executive orders.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (SVP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nAnd I think it took some time for our customers to kind of digest that and understand kind of what the priorities are. I think as that is starting to become understood what the priorities are and kind of figuring out where things are going, you know, we're seeing that as a tailwind in the near term as well. So I think, you know, we, whether it's a radar platform, whether it's a drone, whether it is, you know, a satellite, there's just a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us. And, you know, I think we're well positioned to get our unfair share.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nMaybe on the M and A front, the DNA space remains a very attractive area for us fill this point, our strength there with customers and other technologies could lead us to be a better owner of certain businesses. And so we're actively looking in that space. It's generally margin accretive for us, and where the valuations make sense, and there's a strategic merit for the transaction where we are expecting to be active. Beyond that, it's a typical deployment of our cash to return value to shareholders in disciplined manner.\n\n**James Schneider** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nGreat. Thank you. In terms of the tariff related kind of buffering, I guess, why isn't there more of that? I would feel like given the dynamic of kind of shifting tariff potential, it would just behoove people to have a little bit more inventory. I guess, what are those conversations like?\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nAnd is there any kind of pushback on you from your customers saying, we need to pass along component savings to mitigate this, any price pressure or anything you might see from that?\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nIt's difficult to precisely isolate it, right? Especially as you're coming off of a new seasonal pattern in our largest customer and with the launch of the spring model that included our ET PMIC, which was new content and we're in the early stages of a fall ramp where we've achieved greater than 10% content gains, which is new as well. So given the preliminary sell through data we're seeing, most of the strength that we're seeing aligns with the phones that are being purchased, whether it's third party data or the carriers themselves. But I don't know if\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nThe only thing I would say add to that is, the only area we're seeing the tariffs impact, as Dave mentioned, is the battery operated power tools. That's the one area clearly we've seen it where it's not even buffering. They're just holding off on their production plans to figure out where they're going to make things around the world until they understand what the tariffs are going to be. But as for the other parts of our business, large defense obviously doesn't matter. We're not seeing it in other areas.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nThe only area primarily is in the battery operated power tools area.\n\n**Joseph Moore** (Managing Director)\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned CSG kind of delay and a little bit lower full year. Is there anything we should be aware of there in terms of how to model the rest of the year? Is there a discrete fall off or is that just something that just ramps a little later than you would thought?\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nIt's something that will affect the top line there. In terms of the growth for the year, like I said, it would be in the single digits versus the kind of low double digits as we had communicated in the past. That would have been something that would have happened later in the year, so it's pushing to fiscal twenty twenty seven. As you think about that business, it's really the combination of our Wi Fi business and our SoC business. As Bob pointed out, our SOC business is the third largest investment next to our mobile business initiatives and our DNA franchise.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThe SOC business within CSG is generating annual revenues right now of around $60,000,000 So the push out is meaningful as you think about that particular business, and it's incurring around $100,000,000 of OpEx. This is a meaningful shift for the CSG segment under the Qorvo consolidated results.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I two of them. First one is kind of a clarification.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nOn the pull ins, is the pull ins mainly in June, or are you also seeing pull ins in the September? And within that, among your largest customer, how much of the current generation RF and power products are common or shared with the 2026 model? And then I had a longer term question for Bob after that.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSure. So in recent to quantify it, David already said earlier that we were expecting maybe 15,000,000 to $30,000,000 that we would expect to see and that's all incorporated in our guidance. So the unwinding of that in our September and throughout the rest of the year is all contemplated in what we've been talking about today. If there's anything more to add or you can ask Bob your second question.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nYeah, and what Grant referred to and I'm answering that's our component inventory. From everything we can see that what we're shipping is being built and sold through. So that 15,000,000 to 30,000,000 we're talking about is just some buffering that we've seen around our component inventory, mostly in China, but in other areas as well as customers optimize their factories and maybe in response to tariffs or other reasons as they move production from one factory to another.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Got it. And then just like a longer term question for Bob. Bob, kind of curious your thoughts on edge AI implications for smartphones and RF. It seems like there's, like, you know, from a RF standpoint, you need more uplink MIMO capability and also, I mean, my the phones need to be upgraded to power class two for Edge AI situation, which could happen as early as 2026.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nFor launch, I'm very curious your view on Edge AI and what it implies for out of content on a go forward basis.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nThanks for your question. I think you're correct that we are going to need more and better RF. That's something we say all the time. Frank, I think you can handle that question. We've had a lot of discussions about exactly those things.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nWe're not so much hung up on is it being driven by AI. It's just always the carriers want to get people on and off the network faster, particularly as you continue to load more and more data. Whether it's being driven by AI or not, that's secondary to us. What we're focused on is how they keep changing the architectures to drive more and better RF. So Frank, you want to handle that?\n\n**Frank Stewart** (SVP &amp; President of Advanced Cellular)\nYes. No, it was a great question and simply stated, yes, I agree with you. If we take you all the way back to our Analyst Day, we talked about five gs Advanced as something that was going to continue to drive RF content, more and better RF in the phone. And a few of the examples we referenced were exactly things that you highlighted, additional both downlink and uplink RF pass in the phone and an increase in power levels in multiple bands, therefore, expanding the power class two levels from just one or two bands to multiple bands in the phone. So, yeah, I think I think you hit, hit on exactly what we expect to see over the next few years.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question is from Gary Mobley with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (MD &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to respectfully push back on some of the guidance you're giving for fiscal year twenty six. Essentially, you're upsizing fiscal year twenty six or at least the first half by about $100,000,000 versus your prior soft views or hard views. And that's the difference between having revenue flat for the year or growing 3%, but yet you're saying only 15,000,000 to $30,000,000 of that upside is coming from pull forward.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (MD &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nSo is this a situation where the year is off to a great start, but it's just too early to upsize your fiscal year twenty six outlook? Or is this really a deep rooted concern about tariff pull forwards?\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nHey, Gary, this is Grant. Let me try to take a stab at your question. I mean, generally speaking, as we said, there's 's upside in demand that's broad based. It's not just smartphones, we're seeing it in our growth in our DNA business. And then for the full year, talked about some of the puts and takes by business segment.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSo we're seeing a push out of some revenue for CSG into fiscal twenty twenty seven because of the large automotive program there, which changes the full year. We're seeing a two thirds of our 150,000,000 to $200,000,000 of our Android business that we expect to decline in fiscal twenty six will also hit the second half. And then on top of that, we do have the overhang of macroeconomic uncertainty. The combination of all these factors are leading to our internal views on the full year and why we're not providing an update to our early comments in January.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (MD &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nGot it. Thanks, Grant. And just my follow-up. I wanted to ask about the practicality of separating ACG from the RF businesses of HPA and CSG. How much how tight is coupling from an R and D or from a manufacturing perspective are all three of those businesses on the RF side?\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSure. So I'll take a first pass and then I'm sure Bob and Philip would want to weigh in as well. The businesses themselves are rather tightly coupled. They share factories, that share process engineering, they share product development in certain cases. There are BAW filters, for example, applications that are also used in Wi Fi applications for CSG.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThere is a significant amount of overhead that's the same across the different businesses. And in fact, there's a lot of learning that happens, whether it's base stations to the smartphones themselves or just customers that are shared, for instance, mobile customers across CSG and ACG, for example. So there is a considerable amount of shared resources amongst all the businesses. It's also true that commercially our defense businesses appreciate our defense customers anyway appreciate the scale that we have from the size of our high volume factories that are serving our mobile customers and vice versa, our mobile customers appreciate the commitment we have to our production lines and the technology advancements and the diversity of our revenue stability that comes along with the DNA business and other areas. There's a lot of shared resources and shared positive sentiment amongst the customers across the businesses.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nOnly thing I'll add Grant is they all use the same Oregon Hillsboro fab for gas, all three business units.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question is from Chris Cassel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nYes. Hi. I guess the first question, just a clarification of, know, sort of what the, what the Android business looks like exiting the fiscal year, given all you said. And I think what my interpretation is, you'd be sort of a China Android of about maybe twenty to thirty million exiting the year, but I guess I'm not sure if that's complicated by some of the inventory buffering. If you could clarify kind of where you think China Android is at the end of the year.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nI think maybe just a clarification, Chris, on your question. Did you say exiting the year 20,000,000 to $30,000,000 of Android based China business?\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nYes.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nOkay. I think that's on the low end. There's still a bifurcation of their product portfolio.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nThey have flagship and premium tier devices and we'll still look to participate in those. The customers will make their own cost and performance trade offs amongst the parts, but they'll still need to remain competitive if they want to feel the device that's going to sell well and consequently will be able to sell into the higher end of their portfolios. It won't be in the likely in the 20,000,000 to $30,000,000 range. It will probably be higher than that, but the trend is down over time as we continue to execute on our pricing strategies and move forward. As we've commented on this last quarter, our China based Android revenue was just under $100,000,000 and it'll be trending lower over time.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Okay, that's helpful to calibrate us. A follow-up question was on Samsung, and there's two dynamics there because I think you're also exiting some of the mid range there, but you're still focused on the high end. I guess two questions there is, as you look into next year, given the exit, the mid range, some of the gains in the high end, what do you think happens to the Samsung business there? And then secondly, in the event that Samsung is more successful with their internal chipset, which they're trying again on that, is that a benefit for Qorvo content?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nI'd be glad to take the second part. The answer is yes. We would love for them to be successful with their internal baseband. Yeah. You're right. Across business units, not just ACG.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nYeah. And you're right about exiting the mass here or there as well. It takes longer. The design cycles are longer, sometimes they use things for multiple generations. So you can kind of think of it very similar to how our China business is, but further out in time.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nAnd so we've got some strong business still remaining there in the mass tier as well as some of the flagship I talked about. So that'll kind of continue on and it'll be about a year probably behind the China business. And as we look forward to the we talked a little bit about our success in the second half flagship. As we as we look forward in the first half flagship next year, we do expect that our content will probably decline there. They're not introducing a new technology from an RF standpoint.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP - Sales and Marketing)\nAnd so you know, the opportunity there for more competition to come And so we'll probably you'll probably see some decline in our content on the spring model.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question is from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (MD - Equity Research, Semiconductors &amp; IT Hardware)\nYes. Thank you. With the SAW line moving your Richardson facility, which follows the consolidation of your Farmers Branch facility into that business into that fab two years ago, I guess, you at or near full utilization in the Richardson facility? And then at what point do need to significantly add capacity here as we think about the free cash flow generation of this business? And I have a follow-up, please.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nSure, Karl, this is Grant. No, we have room there in our Richardson facility to expand and add the saw line. We've improved the die size and overall device size of a number of our products over the years meaningfully and that effectively increases your capacity as you don't have to run as many wafers to produce more dye that are smaller. So we've been very successful at the dye size reductions again, other device reductions in order to accommodate all of the BAW filter production that moved in from Farmers Branch as well as the projected saw demand that we will move there from our North Carolina facility.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (MD - Equity Research, Semiconductors &amp; IT Hardware)\nGot it. Thanks for that. Yeah, if I could just go back to, I think Gary's question a bit, given there seems to be no change in your smartphone unit assumption this year, I think they're pretty consistent about double digit content gain as your largest customer. There doesn't appear any clear signs of tariff pull ins and believe this, the Android headwind of roughly 150,000,000 also consistent, so I suppose barring macro uncertainty and maybe some push out of CSG from automotive, those seem to be the two primary variables that would dictate whether we would move from what was the initial outlook of flat year over year growth or are there any other mechanics that we should consider when thinking about the growth rate for this year? Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (SVP &amp; CFO)\nNo, I think you're considering everything that we've said. Look, we could be wrong if we're overly conservative. We'll see how the unit volumes play out over the course of the year, as well as the mix of those unit volumes as we see over the course of the year. That can meaningfully change our top line obviously, depending on share shifts amongst the handset providers.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management for closing remarks.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President &amp; CEO)\nWe want to thank everyone for joining us on tonight's call. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to speaking with many of you at upcoming investor events. Thanks again and let's have a great evening.\n\n**Operator**\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then 1 on your telephone keypad.\n\n**Operator**\nTo withdraw your question, please press then 2. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Douglas Delito, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Doug DeLieto** (Vice President, Investor Relations)\nThanks very much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal twenty twenty five fourth quarter earnings call. This call will include forward looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our annual report on Form 10 ks filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non GAAP financial results.\n\n**Doug DeLieto** (Vice President, Investor Relations)\nWe provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website at ir.corvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO Grant Brown, CFO Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing Philip Chesley, President of High Performance Analog Eric Creviston, President of our Connectivity and Sensors Group Frank Stewart, President of our Advanced Cellular Group as well as other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThanks, Doug. Welcome everyone to our call. Qorvo delivered a strong March with notable achievements in each of our operating segments. In ACG, we supported a critical new phone launch by our largest customer. Qorvo content in this highly anticipated model includes an envelope tracking power management solution, custom developed for this customer over multiple years in support of their internal baseband.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nOur envelope tracking roadmap represents a long term content growth opportunity for Qorvo as our largest customers' baseband shipments expand. In HPA, we posted a record revenue quarter in our defense and aerospace business. Strength was broad based and included applications such as manned and drone based airborne radar, space based radar, SATCOM, EW and missile defense systems. In CSG, we continue to increase our sales funnel of ultra wideband opportunities. Our ultra wideband sales funnel for automotive has grown more than $500,000,000 over the last twelve months and now exceeds $2,000,000,000 For fiscal year twenty twenty five, both CSG and HPA grew revenue double digits.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nAs we think about the business broadly, we are pleased to see the positive impact of our ongoing initiatives to improve performance. Our growth and margin targets are anchored in multi year strategy focused on winning content with our largest customer. Building on our core RF and power expertise to drive diversification through CSG and HPA and continuing to operate our business and manufacturing footprint in a disciplined and efficient manner. Key growth levers include continued momentum in defense and aerospace, expansion of our power management and ultra wideband businesses, and sustained content growth in flagship and premium mobile devices. On the margin side, we are executing a clear set of actions.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThese include shifting away from legacy Android programs, scaling high value products and consolidating our manufacturing footprint in gas and in assembly and test, as well as the closure of our facility in Costa Rica, which Grant will discuss further in his remarks. These moves are already yielding benefits and position us well for the future success across our operating segments. Turning to our strategic highlights by market. In the automotive market, we began sampling a fully integrated ultra wideband programmable SoC. This automotive qualified SoC addresses industry demand for highly accurate and reliable UWB technology in automotive applications such as secure keyless entry, child presence detection, kick sensors and other precision short range radar applications.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nAlso during the quarter, we significantly expanded our automotive connectivity footprint in Japan with a WiFi design win for the leading OEM, and we expect first shipments to commence in calendar twenty twenty six. In consumer markets, we ramped production of our first power management IC design win for a wearable. This PMIC optimizes charging for a smartwatch launching later this year. We also supplied a global manufacturer of power tools and outdoor power equipment with first samples of our battery management SoC, leveraging embedded AI and machine learning algorithms to improve battery performance. In collaboration with Nordic Semiconductor, we announced the availability of an Alero compliant Smart Lock reference design that combines VLE and ultra wideband.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThe Alero protocol is backed by industry leaders and is expected to accelerate adoption by securing communication between smart locks and personal devices like smartphones and wearables. The reference design combines a Qorvo Ultra Wideband SoC enabling critical functionality like precision location and secure transaction with Nordic's multi protocol SoC. Leveraging AI trained algorithms and superior radar functionality enabled by our ultra wideband front ends, consumer applications such as smart locks can establish and differentiate end user direction of travel and their intent to enhance security, safety, and efficiency. We continue to support the migration to Wi Fi seven with front end wins spanning multiple years in routers, access points, and extenders. We also saw an increase in demand for our BAW filters across 2.4, five, and six GHz for consumer and enterprise WiFi markets.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nLastly, we have begun development for WiFi eight front ends in alignment with market leading chipset providers. Turning to defense and aerospace, we achieved a record quarter and record fiscal year in D and A revenue. This is the third consecutive year of year over year revenue growth. Qorvo is a leading supplier of high performance products and foundry services to the U. S.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nGovernment, defense primes and other global defense and aerospace customers. The sales funnel for our defense and aerospace business currently exceeds $5,000,000,000 and we see a path to scale this business both organically and inorganically to $1,000,000,000 annually. During the quarter, Northrop Grumman recognized Qorvo as one of their top supplier partners at their Supplier Excellence Awards. The award recognizes Qorvo for delivering U. S.-based BAW filter technologies that enhance national security for The US and our allies.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nWe were also recognized by BAE Systems for being a critical supplier for airborne electronic warfare and commercial airborne SATCOM applications. Looking at our defense business broadly, governments around the world are allocating a higher percentage of GDP to defense spending and Qorvo is critical to many of the highest priority programs. We view this as a multi year tailwind to revenue and diversification. Also during the quarter, we launched next generation silicon Ku band Satcom Beamformer ICs for phased array based SATCOM user terminals. There is robust demand for high speed reliable connectivity around the globe and the SATCOM terminal market is expected to see very strong growth over the next several years.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nIn industrial and enterprise markets, customer demand continues to grow for Qorvo's data center power management ICs. We are leveraging our performance leadership in client SSDs as we pivot to higher value SSD opportunities in enterprise and AI data centers. We also began sampling our next generation motor drive SoC for industrial applications. The motor drive SoC integrates our third generation microcontroller with our analog front end. Qorvo pioneered ARM based motor drive SoCs over a decade ago and commercial availability of our newest offering is expected next year.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nTo continue growing our power franchise and deliver added flexibility to customer designs, we expanded our power management portfolio to include a brushless DC motor driver that pairs with a variety of MCUs and is optimized for a broad range of applications, including power and garden pools, drones, EVs, and e bikes. Also during the quarter, customers leveraged our ultra wideband SoC to develop a range of monitoring, security and radar based sensing applications. Qorvo's fully integrated ultra low power SoC contains RF, processing, memory, and onboard software, and it's optimized to support a broad set of use cases. Radar based applications include intrusion detection, gesture recognition, vital sign monitoring, and active monitoring and tracking of room occupancy. Turning to infrastructure, inventories in our base station business have stabilized and our customer demand for our small signal portfolio has strengthened.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nWe're also in the early stages of DOCSIS four point zero deployments, where Qorvo is a market leader. During the March, we secured a new design win with a leading broadband supplier headquartered in Europe. In mobile, we expanded our opportunity at our largest customer beyond discrete components like tuners and integrated placements such as ultra high band pads with the production ramp of our envelope tracking power management solution. Qorvo played a critical role in supporting this customer's spring phone launch. Our ET solution is mated with their internal baseband, and this represents a key design win and a durable multi year content opportunity.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nFor our largest customer, we are doing what we said during our Investor Day, which is to invest more and win more. For their upcoming fall launch, we have been awarded design wins supporting greater than 10% year over year content growth, and we are addressing additional content in future programs over multiple years. At our second largest smartphone customer, Cordova's design wins this year span our product portfolio. We are broadly represented in flagship and mid tier smartphone launches ramping now and in additional programs launching throughout the year. Design wins in 2025 include low band, mid high band and ultra high band paths, as well as mid high secondary transmit, antenna tuning, discrete filters and Wi Fi seven FEMs.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nWe also secured WiFi seven design wins in support of multiple Android smartphone OEMs, and we are engaged on WiFi eight development with mobile WiFi chipset providers. For Android OEMs based in China, shipments during the quarter supported five gs smartphones across the mid, premium and flagship tiers. Though we continue to ship mid tier design wins customers awarded to Qorvo prior to our pivot, all five gs product development in ACG is focused exclusively on premium and flagship tiers. In summary, we are seeing the positive effects of the actions taken to improve our performance. In HPA, a portion of the savings from our strategic exits of base station pans and silicon carbide is supporting growth in our defense and aerospace as well as our power management franchise.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nIn CSG, we're leveraging decades of leadership in RF solutions, exceptional customer relationships and our core R and D to broaden and accelerate growth in automotive connectivity and SoCs for ultra wideband and matter. In ACG, we've expanded our product portfolio for our largest customer with a successful ramp of ET Power Management and we expect to build upon this with greater than 10% year over year content growth in our largest customers twenty twenty five fall launch. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Grant. Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe delivered solid results for the March exceeding the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $869,000,000 and non GAAP diluted earnings of $1.42 per share. Similarly, non GAAP gross margin of 45.9% and non GAAP operating expenses of two forty seven million dollars were also better than the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting continued cost discipline across COGS and OpEx, including recent restructuring actions. In the March, our largest customer represented approximately 43% of total revenue. For the full year of fiscal twenty twenty five, our two largest customers represented 4710% respectively. For fiscal twenty twenty five in total, we achieved revenue of $3,700,000,000 and non GAAP gross margin of 45.2%, up approximately 70 basis points compared to fiscal twenty twenty four, which is consistent with our commentary last year when we guided to year over year improvement.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOn the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we held approximately $1,000,000,000 in cash and equivalents. We currently have approximately $1,500,000,000 of long term debt remaining and no near term maturities. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $641,000,000 This represents a decrease of $15,000,000 sequentially and a decrease of $70,000,000 on a year over year basis. Turning to the cash flow statement. In the fourth quarter, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $200,000,000 and CapEx of $29,000,000 which resulted in free cash flow of $171,000,000 For fiscal twenty twenty five in total, we generated free cash flow of $485,000,000 returned over $350,000,000 to shareholders via share repurchases and retired over $400,000,000 of debt.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nRegarding our outlook for the current quarter, we are providing forward looking quarterly guidance despite the continued uncertainty surrounding tariffs and broader macroeconomic conditions. Our view reflects numerous underlying assumptions, including those related to a dynamic global trade environment and ongoing supply chain challenges. For reference, in our June guidance, we have assumed a direct tariff related impact of less than $1,000,000 This represents a historical run rate plus relevant new tariffs that will impact the quarter. Beyond the June, if the ninety day pause is not extended, relevant exemptions expire and other retaliatory tariffs become permanent, we expect the direct tariff impact could rise to high single digit millions per quarter in total across COGS, OpEx and CapEx. While the timing and scope of these changes remain uncertain, we are actively monitoring the situation, working closely with customers and taking action to mitigate the impact.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWith that context, our expectations for the June are as follows: revenue of approximately $775,000,000 plus or minus $25,000,000 non GAAP gross margin between 4244% and non GAAP diluted EPS between $0.50 and $0.75 As expressed during our previous call, the June quarter has multiple seasonal items to consider. June is the lowest seasonal quarter for our largest customer and we are on the other side of the Galaxy ramp at Samsung. Like prior years, our DNA business will be down sequentially in June due to program timing. However, given the strength in bookings activity, our expectations for revenue in the June are higher than what we anticipated when we provided guidance last quarter. We project non GAAP operating expenses in the June to be approximately $250,000,000 This includes other operating expense of 1,000,000 to $2,000,000 associated with the residual portions of our digital transformation project and other related items.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nBelow the operating income line, non operating expense is expected to be between 10,000,000 and $12,000,000 reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses along with other items. Our non GAAP tax rate for fiscal twenty twenty six is expected to be between 1819%. However, the impact of global minimum tax legislation for U. S.-based companies under the new administration as well as changes to international tax policy remain uncertain. Qorvo continues to execute on initiatives to improve revenue mix and gross margin with contributions anticipated from each business segment.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nBeginning with ACG, we expect to enhance margins and reduce variability as our portfolio management efforts and pricing strategies reduce our exposure to mass tier Android five gs. In HPA, the divestiture of our silicon carbide business is a margin accretive move as is the expected growth within D and A. In CSG, gross margin will increase given the relocation of gas production to our high volume Oregon site and we expect operating margin will continue to improve as our SoC and automotive connectivity businesses scale. Additionally, we expect to expand gross margin in CSG as we transition our UWB products at external boundaries from a 40 nanometer to a 22 nanometer production process. Qorvo's manufacturing strategy is to internally produce only the most differentiated elements of our products, to geographically align production with customers and suppliers and leverage the scale, capabilities and cost effectiveness of our outsourced partners.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nFor reference, over two thirds of our production costs are external. This includes procured raw materials, wafers purchased from external foundries, as well as packaging, assembly and test services provided by our OSAT partners. We continuously evaluate opportunities to reduce our capital intensity and product costs. As another step in this direction, we have decided to close our facility in Costa Rica to further consolidate our footprint and move closer to our customers and external manufacturing partners. The complexity of our solutions coupled with global RF compliance requirements and multi year design cycles require considerable collaboration with our customers.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe are working closely with our customers and the team in Costa Rica to ensure a smooth transition and expect this action to be completed early next calendar year. Regarding operating expenses, as a part of our ongoing efforts to drive operational efficiency and align our cost structure with long term strategic priorities, we executed a meaningful workforce reduction late last year. This action was primarily focused on our mass market Android business and the related corporate support functions. In parallel, we streamlined our digital transformation efforts, canceling elements of the project to ensure the scope aligns with the anticipated economic benefits. Finally, we sold our silicon carbide business, which will be accretive to both gross and operating margins in fiscal twenty twenty six.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe remain committed to optimizing our portfolio and regularly evaluate each of our investment areas. Where businesses do not meet our financial or strategic objectives, we will continue to act decisively, whether through divestiture or exit, to focus our resources on core high performing areas. We're confident that the steps we're taking today across our product portfolio, business segments and manufacturing footprint enable us to expand growth, profitability and diversification. We're reducing capital intensity and focusing our internal production only where it differentiates our products. The benefits of these strategic actions will become increasingly evident as we advance through fiscal twenty twenty six and into fiscal twenty twenty seven.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nBefore we open up the call for questions, I'd like to reiterate that the purpose of today's call is to discuss fourth quarter results and outlook. We appreciate you keeping your questions focused on those topics. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then 1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then 2.\n\n**Operator**\nRequest to all participants, please restrict yourself to one question and one follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Thomas O'Malley from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Thomas O’Malley** (Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the nice results. I wanted to ask about the commentary on content, the largest smartphone customer. Obviously, that's a really nice forecast for the year. Could you talk about things that are driving that?\n\n**Thomas O’Malley** (Analyst)\nObviously, you have an ETE chip that's coming into play, but also you would be concerned in like a broader environment that there may be pricing headwinds. Maybe just broadly, can you talk about your largest customers and if you're facing any sort of pricing squeeze over the next couple of quarters or if you're able to offset that in any way? I just want to understand the context there. Thank you.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nSure. Thanks, Tom. I think we'll go ahead and let Frank Stewart who runs the business go ahead and answer your question for you.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Senior VP &amp; President of Advanced Cellular)\nYeah, so, hey, Tom. Maybe I'll start with the largest customer side of your question. So yeah, we're really excited about fall launch upcoming, really proud of what the team accomplished and capturing content there across multiple product categories. It covers things that you know well, antenna tuning and switches, we've added filters there, we've continued to be strong in our ultra high band content, and as we talked about for the spring launch, we're going to enjoy some envelope tracking content in those models as well.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nDave, you want to talk about, I think it's going to Samsung as well?\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP, Sales and Marketing)\nYeah, and I think Tom, you asked about pricing too. I mean, so we've talked a lot about what's been going on in the mass tier and the challenges that we face there. So we've been exiting that part of the business. We still see in premium flagship tier, it's about performance and that's where we're competing. And so like Bob mentioned on the call, we had some nice content in our Galaxy S25 ramp, still some phones coming in that platform that are yet to ramp.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP, Sales and Marketing)\nAnd then we talked last quarter, think about our content in the second half flagships, this is kind of a flip and fold and fan edition type models. And we had pretty low content last year. We said we were going to win that back and we have. So we had less than $1 of content last year and we've got multiple dollars of content. Very similar to what we have in the S-twenty five ramping in the second half of the year. So we feel pretty good about our position there.\n\n**Thomas O’Malley** (Analyst)\nSuper help on all the color. Just on the fiscal year, you guys had kind of previously talked about a little bit of a decline. So one side of things, it sounds like you're seeing some real strength. And then on the Android side, you're obviously being more strategic in where you invest. If you look at like the cadence for the year, which is something that I think is a little difficult to kind of model and look at, how fast should we be seeing Android fall off?\n\n**Thomas O’Malley** (Analyst)\nJust because it looks like in the March, you actually had a little bit of an uptick there. Is that last time buys? And then how quickly is that going to fall off throughout the year?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThanks, Tom. This is Bob. Actually, we're going to see a little bit of an uptick this quarter in June, which is typically consistent with the last three years. We typically see Android up as a percent of sales in our business and it's going be up slightly in dollars. But it's going depending on what new phones that are launched that we're in and the decline in some of the mass tier phones are ramping down and we're also we're enjoying good business.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nWe talked about some of The U. S. Customers that being Google, obviously, we're doing well there as they ramp. Dave mentioned other phones. So it has all to do with the timing of new phones and how well they sell, but it is going to decline year over year as we said. We're not backing away from that change.\n\n**Thomas O’Malley** (Analyst)\nThank you, guys.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nYeah. Hey, guys. Congratulations also on very nice quarter and results. Bob, maybe you could clarify something for us. You mentioned that you want an ET solution on the internal baseband for a customer.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nAre you sharing this with somebody? And then secondly, you also talked about sort of a nice double digit kind of content increase. So is the content increase coming because the baseband is moving to other models or is it coming because you're also winning stuff across the board in other categories as well? Just this and then I have a follow-up.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes, thanks Harsh. I will go ahead and take the second question. I mean, as Frank has already outlined, we picked up some share in a number of different buckets, so we will start there. At ET PMIC, we are sole source. We've been sole source when that first the baseband started at Infineon that they use, then it went to Intel and now it's the Intel modem.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nSo we continue to be sole source. It's a highly iterative process. They're very integral to work with the baseband. And as you know, and I'll just use Qualcomm as an example, they were very tightly coupled with their own ETP mix and it's the same way with this baseband.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nUnderstood. Thank you. And then, Bob, another clarification. I guess curious what you're seeing with your largest customers. There's been a lot of reports of pull forward companies.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nI don't blame them, but a lot of companies are doing stuff to avoid tariffs. I guess curious if you are seeing that and you think your results are reflecting that and if that's the case, when do you think you go back to normal or maybe you're not seeing it? I just love to understand what's happening.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes, I think one thing that people need to keep in mind here is they did launch a spring phone, which they typically don't. When you launch a new phone, you typically produce more to go ahead and stock your channels, so you get ready for the sell through and we're expecting that to come down next quarter, which is typical when you launch a new phone. So from that perspective, it's pretty normal. And when I look at the overall business, we've some things move into quarter, some things move up the quarter kind of normal. So I'll stop there Harsh.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nI mean, we're not seeing anything massive moving one way or another. Right now, but Grant?\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nRight I would reiterate that I think we've seen some modest activity, it's only notable in light of the tariff environment, but not meaningful in terms of dollars, primarily smartphones generally, but nothing that suggests customers are overreacting in terms of push ins or excuse me, push outs or pull ins in every quarter. So nothing abnormal there.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nAppreciate it guys. Congrats again. Thank you.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThank you, Harsh.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nYes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess the first question is regarding some of your comments about the direct tariff impact if things are in pause, you talked about high single digit millions. Can you detail a little bit more of what your assumptions are behind that?\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nWhat do you mean by that? And just in general, there's a lot of uncertainty with tariffs in The US. There's some concern about what tariffs may be charged and what might be paused going into China. Can you just kind of update us on your position and what your assumptions are right now?\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nHey, Chris, this is Grant. Let me spend some time on this one, because I think it's an important question. The first part of it there is the assumptions themselves, at least in the high single digit million. It's I wouldn't necessarily think of us as anticipating any twists or turns in the tariff environment. It's probably unknowable, but you could think of if all the worst things that we know of today would work against us.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThat would be how we would size it. It's an unlikely scenario, but wanted to highlight just in the grand scheme of things, how small the overall impact could be and maybe on that front, how we think about the tariff environment, it does remain dynamic and unpredictable, but I can start there and then we can talk a little bit about how we're managing it. We've had mitigation measures in place for quite a number of years and today we continue to leverage those same tools. But again, the situation is fluid as we pointed out in my prepared remarks and in the June, we've got about a million dollars there or less than that and it represents a historical run rate plus some of the new tariffs that are relevant in the quarter. That's across all of COGS, OpEx and CapEx.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo it's probably better than feared. They're complex as to what goods they apply to, how they're calculated and who pays them, all depends on the countries involved, the nature of the products and relevant commercial terms. So it's specific to any given company. Regardless, you should know that we're not disadvantaged due to our geographic presence. We have a hybrid manufacturing footprint, multiple qualified flows and a lot of flexibility in how we serve our customers.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nBut that said, maybe a little bit of detail, I could break it into maybe four categories for you. The first would be U. S. To U. S, where a meaningful amount of our revenue comes from products that we manufacture in The US and then we sell to US customers.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOur defense business is a good example of that, and it's sizable. It has some exposure related to input costs such as aluminum, but generally very little tariff exposure. The international to U. S, in that case, isn't much product that comes back into The U. S.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThat's subject to tariffs. However, tariffs do increase the acquisition cost per factory equipment. So in that particular scenario, the impact is largely CapEx related. In an international to international scenario, we generate revenue from products that are built and sold outside The U. S.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo for example, our tuners and ETP mix are fabbed at non U. S. Silicon foundries and then sold to international customers and contract manufacturers. So that's a good example of things that are on that international to international exposure. And then lastly, probably the most misunderstood is The U.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nS. To international category. In this case, integrated module business is a good example. We produce intermediate goods such as wafers that contain our filters and PAs at our US facilities, and then we ship those to bonded free trade zones. Once in Asia, our OSAT partners integrate those with a considerable amount of other content, non US components such as laminates, capacitors, etcetera.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThe bill of material contains dozens and dozens of components and they substantially transform those raw materials into some finished goods. So that when the part is actually built during assembly, that is where the substantial transformation occurs in the country of origin is designated. So we're actually made in China, sold in China, if you will. So there's no noticeable impact. Obviously, the tariffs are complicated and we're managing it, but I think it comes down to each company's particular circumstances.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThe overall impact being generally small today. Obviously, there could be some broader demand related impacts, but just in so far as the direct impacts, I think that helps shape Qorvo's exposure for you. We have a lot of options and flexibility and we'll continue to leverage those.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nThat's very helpful and thank you very much for the detailed answer. For my follow-up, I guess I wanted to get to the fiscal 'twenty six guidance and you had mentioned, and I guess perhaps it's not wasn't guidance, but it was some indication of kind of flat revenue, 150 basis points gross margin expansion in the current environment is that still a good model for us to follow?\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSure, I'll take that one too. It's probably worth reflecting on it. I'm not going to restate it here what we said last quarter. But we didn't have overly ambitious forecast to begin with. So we're making substantive changes to our business this year in fiscal twenty twenty six and our commentary has reflected that.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe've removed base station PAM, so carbide business we've sold and we're exiting 150,000,000 to $200,000,000 worth of lower margin Android business. So we're making some substantive changes. I mean, you think of the drivers on the year, D and A is arguably cyclical, but far less correlated to the macro economy than perhaps consumer related end markets. Similarly, we're seeing the content that Frank talked about at our largest customer growing over 10% and added a new revenue category there with the ETP MYC. So there's some secular trends here that we're still seeing help buoy our perspective on the year.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAll that said that we're repositioning the business for long term success. So fiscal twenty twenty six is really more about execution and margin improvement to create diversification opportunities outside of mobile where we're on track. We haven't seen anything that materially changes our forward view, but acknowledge that there are potential for indirect tariff impacts. Mean, the meantime, we'll just continue to issue quarter by quarter guidance incorporating all that we know at the time it's issued and executing on the things that are under our control to drive those financial results we talked about last quarter.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from Karl Eckerman from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nYes. Thank you. I have two, please. First, is your content growth with the largest customer coming from your attach rate on their own baseband or are also seeing content on third party basebands as well? I have a follow-up please.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Senior VP &amp; President of Advanced Cellular)\nYeah, hi, this is Frank again. Both, the team did a good job of succeeding on content across the board. So, I think we've been clear that when it comes to our ETP mix that is unique to the internal baseband, but the content that we captured on all the other product categories mentioned is broad based across both.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nHelpful. Thank you. And then second, where are you on working through previously under absorbed inventory? And do you foresee tariffs to impact your China based demand? And I suppose if demand were to moderate, is the margin associated with the China based demand higher than corporate average?\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nSo if you could just follow-up on that, that'd be great. Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWell, we've actually made really good progress bringing down our inventory overall. So very proud of that. It's unlocking some free cash flow for us. I think it's been a positive trend for us. We didn't overbuild.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe brought utilization down very quickly quite some number of quarters ago in order to react to it and we've worked through the inventory levels successfully. So we don't see anything abnormal from an inventory perspective or expect there to be a noticeable impact at this point.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you. First, a clarification and then I have a question. On clarification, you talked about 150,000,000 to $200,000,000 headwind from exiting the Android, I think low end Android last quarter. Is that still on track? Are you tracking better or worse?\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nIf you can clarify that, then I have a question.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes. Thanks, Srini. It's on track, playing out as we expected.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay. Thank you. And then Bob, on the D and A, it looks like the business has been faring quite well and some of the trends that you highlighted make a lot of sense. You also talked about potentially getting to a $1,000,000,000 annual run rate. Could you give us maybe some color as to where the business is today in terms of run rate?\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nAnd then also in terms of product categories and maybe geographic exposure, if you could give us because we don't get a lot of details on this business. So I think any color on the business would be helpful in terms of the growth drivers. Thank you.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (Senior VP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nYes, Shereen, this is Philip. I'll maybe dive into that a little bit as well. So I think kind of break down your questions here. So I think Bob said in his prepared remarks that we have over a $5,000,000,000 design win funnel right now. And we size the business, I believe it was last quarter or so at around $400,000,000 When you look at our design win funnel, it really is broken pretty evenly between the big end market segments that we kind of play in today.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (Senior VP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nAnd if you look at that, that's radar comms, electronic warfare with our solid state PA technology that we have, which is high power RF, space and satellite based comms, satcom, differentiating that between space based, more ground based, kind of satcom terminal business, and as well as missile applications, whether that's traditional hypersonic. You know, we we touch a lot and most of the most of the segments, you know, in the in the DNA space. And so, you know, when you look at when you look at where we're winning, it's really driven around, you know, this big upgrade cycle that we've been seeing for a lot. Right? And, we've talked about it at Investor Day where whether it's an older asset, whether that's a ship or a plane, it needs upgraded radar capability.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (Senior VP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nWhether it's a new system, I mean, just announced the F-forty seven as an example, right? And so that's going to require a lot of advanced radar platforms that is right technologies that is what we provide. So you look at that. The other thing I would say is that the DoD has an approved continued resolution right now for FY twenty five. If you look at where that is focused, that's focused on deterring China, that's focused on hypersonics, that's focused on alternative GPS, that's focused on UAVs, all segments where we play and have wins in big programs that we can't mention them all.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (Senior VP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nWe're under contract, like I can't give specifics. The other thing that gets me excited as well, you look at the budget for FY '26, they've already are talking about $150,000,000,000 worth of additions over the next few years to really beef up advanced technology platforms here in The US. And then I think one of the things that we haven't sized, because it's relatively new, you look at the foreign military sales and what's happening in Europe with their kind of rebuilding of their military capability. What I'm hearing talked about is that that's a 1,000,000,000,000 opportunity upgrade over the next few years, over the next five to ten years as they do that. So today, we have, I would say, a meaningful percentage of our revenue in DNA that's foreign military sales.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (Senior VP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nWe're engaged with every one of the key customers in Europe in particular, but not just Europe, outside of Europe as well. And I think the last thing that I would well, two last things I'd leave you with. One is that the other area that I think is exciting as you see a lot of these, what I'll call new tech defense players, I won't list them by name, but there's a lot of new Silicon Valley entrants that are coming in and coming in with new technologies that they're trying to move faster than what they ever have. And we have really strong partnerships with those customers. And so I think that's big for us.\n\n**Philip Chesley** (Senior VP &amp; President of High Performance Analog)\nLast thing I would say, and again, I'm saying this because we don't get talking about this a lot, is that I want to remind everyone Corvo is really unique in the space. We have all most of the key RF technologies onshore that are needed for these platforms, whether that's GaN, whether that's gas, beamforming through our Enoki Wave acquisition, BAW filters, low frequency, high frequency, high power solid state PAs, which are critical for electronic warfare applications. And we have that advanced our packaging. And I can't think of a single other company out there that has all of that in one place. And I think that's why you see such excitement around it and our funnel really accelerating over the last year or so.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks, Phil. Very detailed. I appreciate it.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Next question comes from Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Grant, based on the number you just gave for your largest customer for the fiscal year, looks like you were flat year over year in total total revenue. We can talk, you know, different unit volumes, etcetera, but it kind of speaks to maybe I know you've gotten some contact gains on the last fall's phone, but it doesn't seem like you got a lot of boost from the the spring phone. So one, I wanna get your feeling on, will the content gains material and unit volume is just weak, or why are we seeing kinda flat? And then secondarily, based on even our teardown, it looks like your content might have been a little light.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nWithout the ET PIMICs, it would have been light on the spring foam. With ET PIMICs, it looks about even, maybe still a little bit down. Is that a correct assessment? And is that the baseline we should expect from the internal modem phone for this year or next year? And then I have a follow-up.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Senior VP &amp; President of Advanced Cellular)\nYeah, hey, this is Frank. Maybe let me take the last one with respect to the 16E that was just released. Maybe I could clarify that that is definitely what I would consider one of their consumer SKUs and we've got different content across different phone types, but for a consumer SKU for Corvo that was actually a pretty good phone for us. We're pretty happy with our dollar content there. So maybe that's the first clarification.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Senior VP &amp; President of Advanced Cellular)\nI'll let you do your follow on question, but I've got some more thoughts for you that I'm guessing will correlate.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nOkay, and then in terms of tariffs, you've had several module houses, correct me if I'm wrong, but in your latest filings you had module assembly in Costa Rica, Korea, Germany, and China. You closed Costa Rica to consolidate, I understand that, as an old Trico facility. Does that mean most of this stuff will shift to Asia, or are you gonna try to distribute, or how are you working that business? Because that seems to be a critical factor in determining where the tariffs are gonna wind up in the end.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nEd, this is Bob. I want to make sure we're clear. What was done in Costa Rica was really the filter technologies there, what's what we call back end packaging there, which is then shipped to our module manufacturers, whether they're in China or Vietnam or wherever they are in the world. So we are moving that to Asia. And in Germany, that doesn't build modules.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThat builds product for us, the CATV line amplifiers, which is nothing like anything in mobile. So I just want to make sure we're clear on those factories do not build modules, Costa Rica nor Germany.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd Ed, maybe just to follow-up on your question regarding Asia. We have multiple flows for a number of these products as well as multiple partners that we can use. So depending on the optimal structure and we'll work that with our suppliers and partners. We have a lot of options and flexibility as it relates to tariffs.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Senior VP &amp; President of Advanced Cellular)\nEd, if I could, this is Frank. I was going to circle back to answer what might have been your broader question. Maybe to give as much color as I can at our largest customer, there's actually multiple product types where there's two suppliers that share content when they service that customer and Corvo, for example, our antenna tuning, maybe just to clarify that topic, Corvo has actually shared that antenna tuning content with another supplier for a number of years actually going all the way back to 2020. It's the same situation we have for ultra high band, it's a similar situation we have for discrete filters where Corvo has sheer content with some other supplier for multiple generations. So if you think within that environment, so within that environment that we've been in for multiple years, as we said before Corvo is on track to capture greater than 10 content upside in this year, this fall model.\n\n**Frank Stewart** (Senior VP &amp; President of Advanced Cellular)\nSo that's something we're really excited about. And then when you look forward, we see a similar environment going forward that I just described and In that environment, we're excited about the additional content that we're working to gain there.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nI understand it's very difficult to predict because of the wackiness of this year and next year in terms of having two phones and that sort of thing too. But your 10% content increase year over year, can you just maybe give us a little bit of idea how that what assumption you're using in terms of split between the internal versus say the Qualcomm in the fall that drives you that number?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYeah, this is Bob. My usual line when we get to this place is we don't comment on future architectures. Obviously, we know it because we have to build to it, but it's not something we can comment on here.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nOkay. Thanks, guys.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nHi, guys. Most of the juicy topics have been addressed, but I'll do my best here. Do you still feel comfortable with the HPA and CSG businesses growing double digit percent in fiscal year twenty six? And within those two segments, how much business would you characterize as maybe being classically cyclical or subject to ebbs and flows in distribution and customer inventory? And on that specific front, are you seeing any sort of green shoots in terms of order and backlog fill?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nGary, you were pretty choppy. Let me first start with, I believe your first question was our outlook for HPA and CSG growing double digits this year. The answer is yes. The second part, I'm not sure we totally understood. We're not counting on any inventory builds or anything like that at customers.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThis is we're in the right places. Philip has done a great job talking about D and A. I'll let Eric talk a little bit about CSG and where he's seeing growth this year.\n\n**Steven Creviston** (Senior VP and President of Connectivity &amp; Sensors)\nSo in CSG, of course, the largest revenue segment today is Wi Fi, in particular high performance Wi Fi transitioning six to seven and already beginning R and D on eight. So, that's got dollar content growth just as we've seen in multiple generations of cellular RF. And I think that's moving at a pretty high velocity. So we're filling channel right to demand and demands moving out for new base stations and Wi Fi access points for industrial and enterprise and so forth. So that's sort of the largest segment.\n\n**Steven Creviston** (Senior VP and President of Connectivity &amp; Sensors)\nIt's certainly got growth opportunity with content. And then of course, of investments going into the SOC business and the sensor business today. In the SOC business, we're looking at BLE matter, as well as ultra wideband, both experiencing really rapid growth relative to our average. I've been particularly excited actually about the matter growth opportunity. We're not the first in that space, but we've got some unique capability we're bringing to it and design traction and even volume ramping is going very well.\n\n**Steven Creviston** (Senior VP and President of Connectivity &amp; Sensors)\nUltra wideband, of course, are a leader in technology there. Automotive has gotten very, very strong for us in terms of design in, takes quite a while, of course, to get that to production revenue. But once we do, we'll be running for many years in that. We're engaged across a number of very large opportunities, and it's going very well in auto. But then also ultra wideband, I think we're leading in the other applications, in particular connected home applications.\n\n**Steven Creviston** (Senior VP and President of Connectivity &amp; Sensors)\nWe've got a lot of opportunity there and also other sort of lighting applications, as we mentioned with matter. So really across the board, a lot of opportunities driving these new technologies, the wheels just beginning to spin and pick up momentum here.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP, Sales and Marketing)\nAnd the other area is the location and real time location services. We talked about that ramping. So that is ramping now. It takes time as another market takes a while to develop, that will start to build on itself as we head through this fiscal year and into the next couple of years.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you for that. And Grant, just a quick follow-up. Are you still expecting OpEx to hover in this $250,000,000 per quarter level for the balance of fiscal year '20 '20 '6?\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nI think you're referring to maybe our guidance for the year quarterly for OpEx at $250,000,000 We still believe that's a reasonable threshold plus or minus 2%, three % maybe. There's seasonal impacts, there's potentially other items in there. I'd call out the weakness in the U. S. Dollar is one that works against us and so far as our OpEx, again, not necessarily meaningful on a normal basis, but should it continue to weaken significantly that could add to OpEx and other seasonal factors.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nBut generally, that's a good working assumption at the baseline.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you. This is John Marco on for Tim. Guys, I just wanted to ask about tariffs impact, and you mentioned taking steps to limit the impacts. But can you talk about exactly what what is it that you're doing? We know you benefit from tariff free zones in China, but what exactly are you doing to limit the impact here?\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nYeah, sure. So, know, I mean we have a pretty experienced team, right? I mean you go all the way back to Huawei, ZT being banned and there were similar dynamics in play there. We successfully navigated those challenges before and we identified the same solutions that are being used and have been for quite some time, we'll continue to use. So we'll optimize around those.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe have flexibility in our supply chain. We have alternate second sources. We've been collaborating with customers on their mitigation strategies and the locations where they work and produce their own products. But at the end of the day, I think it really comes down to the country of origin question, right? I mean, we have a substantial transformation in the parts when they are built, assembled and tested in China and sold to Chinese OEMs or contract manufacturers.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo there's a that's I think probably misunderstood, a really key element of what's going on here.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nGot it, okay. And then just one quick one, I just want to double click again on the demand pulling point that was made previously on the call, but in the context of your guidance. So how much of the demand into the June in your view could be related to tariffs?\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThis is Graham, let take that one. I think what you're alluding to maybe is some pull ins related to tariff activity. I mean, like we've commented, we've seen modest activity. It's only notable in the light of the tariff discussion, but it's not meaningful in terms of dollars. It's largely smartphones and we're not seeing any customers overreacting push in or excuse me, pull ins and push outs occur every quarter.\n\n**Grant Brown** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo it's relatively normal. I don't know, Dave, if you\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP, Sales and Marketing)\nhave I can shed some light on that too, in particular some of our customers in China. Of course, when all this stuff gets announced, it creates a bit of panic and people just don't understand how things are going to work, right? And so we get on calls and we kind of work through our supply chain, their supply chain and what are the real risks and whether they can be mitigated or not. And so I can tell you that a lot of that activity has died down, right. As people really start to understand the situation, really understand what Grant described in terms of how country of war is determined, know, all that activity kind of starts to fade away.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (SVP, Sales and Marketing)\nAnd so then the motivation to change their demand profile goes away as well. So that's kind of what we're seeing play out.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks guys, very helpful.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We'll take that as the last question for today. And this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to the management for closing remarks.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nI want to thank everyone for joining us on tonight's call. We appreciate your interest. We look forward to speaking with many of you at our upcoming investor events. Thanks again. Hope you have a great evening.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nGood day, and welcome to the Qorvo Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Call.\n\n**Operator**\nPlease note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Douglas Dilido, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n**Douglas Dilido** (Vice President &amp; Investor Relations)\nThanks very much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2025 Q3 earnings call. This call will include forward looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our annual report on Form 10 ks filed with the SEC because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non GAAP financial results.\n\n**Douglas Dilido** (Vice President &amp; Investor Relations)\nWe provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Broadworth, President and CEO Grant Brown, CFO Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing and other members of Qorvo's management team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThanks, Doug, and welcome everyone to our call. Qorvo serves 6 primary end markets. They are automotive, consumer, defense and aerospace, industrial and enterprise, infrastructure and mobile. Each is underpinned by global megatrends, including electrification, connectivity, mobility, sustainability, datafication and AI. These trends are driving new functionality and new user experiences that are made possible by the customers we serve and the products our technologies enable.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nLooking at our business by operating segment, in HPA, we continue to grow our defense and aerospace business, while expanding our business in power management. In CSG, we are building upon our strong position in RF solutions across markets, while investing in diverse growth businesses, including an expanding portfolio of automotive solutions and SoCs for ultra wideband, BLE, thread and matter. In ACG, we are focused primarily on delivering 5 gs advanced products for our largest customer and for the flagship and premium tiers of Android. Our largest growth opportunity in ACG is with our largest customer and we are investing today to continue increasing our share with them in subsequent programs over multiple years. As we said on last quarter's call, the opportunity in mass tier Android 5 gs declined at a faster rate than anticipated during our Investor Day.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nAndroid build plans changed to reflect higher consumer demand for entry tier 5 gs devices. In response, during the December quarter, we implemented changes across the organization in how we support Android 5 gs. This included a reduction in force in ACG and other company functions. We narrowed our focus to the premium and flagship tiers to increase profitability and reduce variability. Our 5 gs product development spend is now focused solely on premium and flagship tiers.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nWhile we continue to serve mass tier programs previously awarded, we expect these lower margin programs to go end of life in fiscal 'twenty six and into fiscal 'twenty seven. Besides the impact for fiscal 'twenty five, total Android 5 gs revenue in ACG is expected to be approximately $875,000,000 Of this, we expect Android 5 gs to decline gradually by approximately $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 annually in fiscal 'twenty six and again in fiscal 'twenty seven. The majority of the decline will be China based with the balance being mid tier at Samsung. In fiscal 2026, we expect a single digit decline in ACG revenue and growth of approximately 10% to 12% in CSG and HPA ex the silicon carbide business. Beginning in FY 'twenty seven, we expect ACG to return to growth where updated long term revenue target is for mid single digit growth.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nIn HPA and CSG, our long term revenue targets haven't changed, and we expect double digit growth in fiscal 2025 and double digit growth again next fiscal year in HPA and CSG. We believe the actions we are taking will have a positive impact on our gross margin. For reference, gross margin in the December quarter included a headwind of approximately 300 basis points attributed to the divested silicon carbide business and the mass tier Android 5 gs revenue we are in the process of exiting. As we look into fiscal 'twenty six, we expect gross margin to expand by approximately 150 basis points on roughly flat revenue. In a moment, Grant will expand on the actions we're taking to improve gross margin and reduce OpEx.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nNow let's look at our performance and opportunities by market. We saw sequential strength during the quarter in defense and aerospace, industrial and enterprise and infrastructure. In D and A, revenue was up sequentially in the December quarter, driven by multi year tailwinds. These include upgrades to non terrestrial networks and the transition from mechanical radar systems to active electronic scanning radar systems. Tailwinds also include on shoring, the trend of 1 to many and system level functionality requiring advanced RF packaging.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nDesign wins in December were diversified across radar, comms, space and electronic warfare. In electronic warfare, Qorvo offers an industry leading wideband solid state PA technology. Qorvo is unique in that we can service the opportunity onshore in the U. S. From a minute up to a full system solution through our advanced manufacturing facility in Texas.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nDecember was a record revenue quarter for our DNA business and we expect continued strength to support full year year over year growth this fiscal year and next fiscal year. In industrial and enterprise, revenue was up sequentially. During the quarter, we achieved critical performance milestones related to ultra wideband in Wi Fi enterprise access points. We're engaged with 2 leading Tier 1 equipment manufacturers with ultra wideband and Wi Fi 7 content at both, and we expect commercial production to begin this calendar year. We see this as a significant milestone in ultra wideband adoption, creating the essential infrastructure for new ultra wideband driven services enabled by indoor navigation, asset management and real time location services.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nWe increased shipments of high frequency BAW filters in support of enterprise Wi Fi deployments across geographies and we expanded power management engagements with new and existing customers in enterprise SSDs. Turning to infrastructure, we believe we are past the bottom and are now seeing stabilization in our broadband and cellular base station businesses. December revenue increased significantly year over year in both markets. In the broadband market, we are supporting DOCSIS 4.0 deployments at multiple operators in North America. We are early in these deployments with significant share and we are positioned for growth in our broadband business this coming fiscal year.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nIn our base station business, we have weathered an industry wide inventory correction and see opportunities for our small signal portfolio in markets like India. In automotive, revenue for the quarter declined sequentially as end market softness continues. During the quarter, automotive OEMs and Tier 1s continue to show strong interest in our growing portfolio of automotive grade ultra wideband products. This includes a design win for Asia based EV OEM to supply our ultra wideband solutions in an upcoming vehicle launch. Our sales funnel of automotive ultra wideband opportunities continues to grow as we bring a broad set of new content and capabilities.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThe ultra wideband opportunity in automotive includes multiple anchors and up to $20 per car addressing secure access, child presence detection, kick sensors and other precision short range radar applications. This is new content presenting the type of complex RF challenge Qorvo is uniquely positioned to solve. In consumer markets, December quarterly revenue declined sequentially, reflecting market headwinds. For Qorvo, customer demand continued to build across consumer applications for our Matter SoCs. We are ramping Matter SoCs alongside our Wi Fi 7 FEMs for a leading provider of Wi Fi ecosystems based in the U.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nS. This customer is an early adopter of matter technology in home networking applications, enabling seamless connectivity across lighting, thermostats, window sensors and other consumer applications. We supported a U. S.-based network operator in their migration to WiFi 7 with multiple Qorvo WiFi 7 FEMs, and we secured a design win to support an upcoming WiFi 7 ramp with a network operator in Japan. Lastly, we expanded shipments of our high frequency BAW filters for service providers in the U.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nS. And in Europe. In the mobile market, revenue declined sequentially. During the quarter, we successfully supported the flagship launch at our largest customer. Shipments during the quarter included discrete placements such as tuners as well as integrated placements like ultra high band pads.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThis customer represented just over 50% of the total revenue in the December quarter. In the current quarter, we expect sales to this customer to decline sequentially, though less than the last couple of years. As we have said previously, we have secured sufficient wins to date to give us confidence in year over year content growth in this year's PAW launch. Qorvo revenue is more heavily weighted towards the Pro and Pro Max models versus lower content consumer models. Volumes and mix across models and model years can change our weighted average content in any given year.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nGiven these variables, for FY 'twenty six, we're currently forecasting revenue at our largest customer to be flat to up modestly. At our largest customer, we've been invited to compete and are engaged on more product programs than ever before. At our 2nd largest customer, core road design wins this year with this Korea based Android OEM span our product portfolio. We will be broadly represented this year in the flagship launch ramping now as well as in their high volume mid tier, premium tier and flagship tier smartphone programs launching throughout the year. Qorvo content in 2025 will include low band, mid high band and ultra high band pads as well as mid high secondary transmit, antenna tuning, discrete filters and Wi Fi 7 FEMs.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nQorvo is executing on a broad set of strategic initiatives to expand margin, generate strong free cash flow and increase shareholder value. We remain very focused on driving growth and diversification, while finding opportunities to improve operating efficiency and enhance our cost structure. The actions we are taking have already resulted in gross margin improvements and a meaningful reduction in our forward OpEx in the current quarter and for fiscal 'twenty six. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Grant.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our December quarter results were favorable relative to our guidance with revenue of $916,000,000 and non GAAP diluted EPS of $1.61 per share. Our non GAAP gross margin of 46 0.5% and non GAAP operating expenses of $248,000,000 were also favorable to our guidance, which reflects continued cost discipline across COGS and OpEx as well as recent restructuring actions. On the balance sheet, as of quarter end, we held approximately $770,000,000 in cash and equivalents. Our cash balance at quarter end reflects the retirement of $412,000,000 of our 2024 notes.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nFollowing the repayment of these notes, we now have approximately $1,500,000,000 of long term debt remaining in no near term maturities. We ended the quarter with a net inventory balance of $656,000,000 This represents a decrease of $38,000,000 sequentially and a decrease of $70,000,000 on a year over year basis. Turning to the cash flow statement. We generated operating cash flow of $214,000,000 and capital expenditures of $38,000,000 which resulted in free cash flow of $176,000,000 As a reminder, our CapEx spend will vary quarter to quarter and reflect the timing of cash disbursements. Consequently, CapEx as a percentage of sales in any given quarter may be above or below our target of approximately 5% of sales.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe repurchased approximately $100,000,000 of stock at an average price of $73 per share in the quarter. The rate and pace of our share repurchase considers several key factors, including our long term financial outlook, free cash flow, debt maturities, alternative uses of cash and other relevant strategic considerations. This approach is designed to ensure that our capital allocation strategy balances future growth with the return of capital and aligns with our underlying goal of delivering long term shareholder value. Turning to our current quarter outlook, we expect revenue of approximately $850,000,000 plus or minus $25,000,000 non GAAP gross margin between 43% 44% and non GAAP diluted EPS between $0.90 $1.10 The sale of our silicon carbide business earlier this month is reflected in our guidance. We will record a negligible amount of silicon carbide revenue in Q4 versus approximately $9,000,000 in the December quarter and approximately $30,000,000 in fiscal 2025.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe project non GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter to be approximately $250,000,000 This includes other operating expense of $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 associated with the remaining portion of our digital transformation project. We expect other operating expense related to this project to remain at this quarterly level throughout fiscal 2026. Below the operating income line, non operating expense is expected to be between $13,000,000 to $15,000,000 reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses along with other items. This aligns with our prior comments that non operating expense would increase following the retirement of our 1.75 percent 2024 notes. Our non GAAP tax rate for fiscal expected to be approximately 11%.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe expect our non GAAP tax rate could increase to between 18% 19% in fiscal 2026 as new regulations take effect. However, the impact of global minimum tax legislation for U. S.-based companies under the new administration as well as changes to international tax policy remain highly uncertain. For modeling purposes, in fiscal 'twenty six, we expect gross margin to expand by approximately 150 basis points on roughly flat revenue. This reflects a single digit decline in ACG revenue and growth of approximately 10% to 12% in CSG and HPA excluding silicon carbide.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nIn ACG, we expect Android 5 gs to decline by $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 from approximately $875,000,000 in fiscal 2025. At our largest customer, for fiscal 2026, we expect revenue to be flat to up modestly. Beginning the fiscal year, our June quarter has multiple seasonal items to consider. June is the lowest seasonal quarter for our largest customer. We are on the other side of the Galaxy ramp at Samsung and like prior years, our DNA business will be down meaningfully in June on a sequential basis due to program timing, while expected to grow double digits for the full year.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nRegarding our actions to improve gross margin, each business segment brings distinct drivers. Beginning with ACG, we expect to enhance margins and reduce variability as our portfolio management efforts and pricing strategies reduce our exposure to legacy mass tier Android 5 gs. In HPA, the divestiture of our silicon carbide business is margin accretive. In addition, our strategic investments supporting continued growth in DNA will also be accretive. In CSG, gross margin will increase with the relocation of gas production from our underutilized North Carolina facility to our high volume Oregon site.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe continuously evaluate further opportunities to reduce our capital intensity and product costs, including process technology advancements and die size reductions. The complexity of our solutions coupled with the global RF compliance requirements faced by our customers results in multi year design cycles. We're working closely with our customers as we align our factory footprint to address only the most differentiated elements of our products and increasingly leverage the scale, capabilities and cost effectiveness of our outsourced partners. All of these factors in aggregate are expected to support high 40% gross margin in seasonally strong quarters during fiscal 'twenty six and up to 50% gross margin in a seasonally strong quarter during fiscal 'twenty seven. On operating expenses, we implemented a significant workforce reduction, primarily targeting our mass market Android business as well as supporting areas to enhance our cost structure.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nIn parallel, we streamlined our digital transformation efforts, canceling numerous elements of the project to ensure the scope aligns with the anticipated economic benefits. And finally, the sale of our silicon carbide business is accretive to both gross and operating margins. These actions are reflected in our Q4 guidance and will extend into fiscal 2026. Overall, we anticipate achieving over $100,000,000 in gross annualized savings across COGS and OpEx. A portion of these savings will be reinvested in the key growth areas such as D and A, power management, ultra wideband and programs for our largest customer as well as to offset inflationary pressures.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nOn a net basis, we expect non GAAP operating expenses to average approximately $250,000,000 per quarter in fiscal 2026 subject to typical quarterly variability. We're confident that the steps we're taking today across our product portfolio and manufacturing footprint are positioning us for success. We're reducing capital intensity and focusing our internal production only where it differentiates our products. The benefits of these strategic initiatives will become increasingly evident as we advance through fiscal 'twenty six and into fiscal 'twenty seven. Before we open up the call for questions, we want to briefly address the filing that was recently made by Starboard Value.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe welcome engagement with all our shareholders and value their input on ways to create shareholder value. With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss our Q3 results and outlook. We appreciate you keeping your questions focused on those topics. At this time, please open the line for questions. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And the first question will come from Gary Mobley with Loop. Please go ahead.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to verify some of the numbers that you guys had in your prepared remarks. If I heard correctly, you will have in fiscal year 2025 about 875,000,000 dollars of revenue from Android customers and that might whittle down to something less than $500,000,000 over the next 5 years. I presume the remainder will be primarily Samsung and maybe some high end customers over in China? Am I running through all that math correctly?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes. Hi, Gary. This is Bob. Thanks. You're correct on the $875,000,000 and you're correct on it's going to be going down about $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 this year, probably the same.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nMost of that will be in China, to your point, but it does include some of the Samsung business and includes more than HBox because we do have other customers in China, some that sell in the U. S.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nOkay.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nBut yes, Bob, I know you're Yes. The remainder will be the remainder of that, but that's still remaining will be in that premium and flagship tier.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nGot it. Okay. Thank you. So Bob, I know you were clear on the assumption that HPA would grow double digit percent in fiscal year 'twenty six. But I wanted to ask a question about the repeatability of the HPA strength that you just showed in the Q3.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nIf I'm not mistaken, there might have been maybe a Department of Defense contract, maybe something a little bit atypical in the quarter. Maybe if you can just give us a sense of the details of that to the extent you can and the repeatability of it?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nSure. Thanks, Gary. We did see nice growth in December. We're also going to see even better growth in March. And it really gets to the timing of the defense contractors and when they flow their money to us.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nSome are tied a little bit more. They give us orders right before the end of the government's fiscal year, which as you know is at the end of roughly our Q3 and then obviously the end of their own calendar year. So we actually see a back half typically much stronger than the first half in our defense business. So yes, we saw good growth in December quarter. We're also going to see even better growth in the March quarter.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nAnd then as Grant mentioned, it's going to drop off in the June quarter. But for the year, we expect defense business to grow actually faster than all of HPA.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nGreat. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nIt's a good point, Bob. Maybe Gary will just expand on that just for a minute. To put it into perspective, our DNA business is now approximately a $400,000,000 business. And again, as Bob mentioned, rather seasonal. The orders there in customer orders and then the program timing, as he mentioned, will be up significantly in March.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd then again, it will fall back down in June. It could be as much as $75,000,000 coming down in June, before growing for the entire year, largely faster than our HPA business in the 10 to 12 range.\n\n**Gary Mobley** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Equity Analyst)\nThanks, Grant.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nYes. Hey, guys. Congratulations on solidly beating the earnings estimate. I guess my first question, Bob, there was a lot in the comments section, but if I heard it correctly, I think you're saying that you're expecting better than normal seasonality for your cellular business and I'm assuming that's with your largest customer. Could you maybe talk about what that means?\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nWhat we should be thinking and expecting? If you can just paint a picture for us, that'd be helpful. Then I do have a follow-up.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes. Thanks, Harsh. On the last quarter's call, we mentioned that we'd probably be down 5% to 10%. You can see our guidance is roughly within that range. And what I said in my prepared remarks is, we'll be down at our largest customer, but not as much as we've been in prior years.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nAnd that's all the color that I'm able to add at this time, Harsh.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nOkay. That's fair. And then Grant, maybe you talked about a lot of things in the gross margin side. If I had to say, what would be the 1 or 2 biggest things that you think Bob or Grant that are needle movers for the gross margin? You talked about high 40s and then ultimately even potentially hitting 50s. What would be 2 of the biggest things that will be happening to make the margin go up in your opinion?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThanks, Harsh. I appreciate the question. We're working on a lot of fronts as it relates to gross margin. Probably 2 of the larger ones would be as we exit some of the Android business that Bob mentioned, it will have an accretive impact on our gross margin just as it relates to revenue mix. Beyond exiting some of that Android business, we're also looking at factory costs and factory footprint and ways we can leverage our outsourced suppliers.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe had a sizable workforce reduction and cost reduction that we handled in the December quarter, and that's going to help us as we look forward. And then of course, there's also the process improvement, die reductions and other sort of blocking and tackling types of things that we're doing in our factories and product design that help drive our costs lower.\n\n**Harsh Kumar** (Managing Director &amp; Senior Research Analyst)\nThank you, sir. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first one was just in relation to March guidance. So you gave us $875,000,000 for the year in Android, you could set that pretty easily. And then you talked about less than seasonal declines in your largest customer.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nSo you have a decent proxy from where ACG is. The other two businesses to kind of get to your guidance, you talked about mid teens growth on the full year. Both of those look to be tracking a little bit ahead just given where guidance is. So is there any weakness that you would call out amongst those 2 businesses in any pockets other than the silicon carbide stuff? Or just trying to square away the math here.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nIf I said Apple down a little better than seasonal and Android to your number, you're getting a little bit above guidance. Any help with March to start?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. Let me take the question. So you're right, the silicon carbide revenue is an important factor. As we look into the March quarter, there'll be a negligible amount of revenue in March versus the December quarter of approximately $9,000,000 So that's one of the changes. It was, for modeling purposes, approximately $30,000,000 for the entire fiscal 2025. Outside of that, as you mentioned, there's typical seasonal dynamics with the ramp down, our largest customer. Android is expected to be up sequentially given flagship platform launches. And then there's a material increase in our DNA business as we've commented on in both December and then again in March. So we're in terms of the CSG business on the other side of some large Wi Fi ramps that we benefited from in Q2.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd overall, year over year, both those businesses will be up double digits. And then as we look forward, we'll continue the momentum into fiscal 2026.\n\n**Thomas O'Malley** (Director - Equity Research)\nGot you. And then you gave a decent amount of color in the prepared remarks. On June, you highlighted that that's normally bottom seasonal for the largest customer. And then you talked about defense being down as well. Just given that you went out of your way to highlight that in the prepared remarks, could you give us any color from a total company perspective what you're expecting there?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe didn't provide any guidance necessarily at a total company level. But if you're modeling it roughly, you're in that down 10% to 15% range for the full company heading into the June quarter. Again, the seasonal dynamics there are a very strong defense business, which has grown in terms of percent of our total top line. So we've benefited from the growth, but the seasonality and order patterns that our customers create a dynamic heading into June that's larger than typical. And then the Android ramp at a large customer for their flagship we'll also be ramping down in the same period that our largest customer ramps down.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSo quite a number of seasonal factors. Although for the year, as Bob pointed out, we do expect to be approximately flat in revenue. So there will be growth in the outside quarters.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question will come from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nYes. Thank you, gentlemen. Given your comments on the Android ecosystem, I was hoping you could address the outlook for RF content for the industry over the next couple of years if the baseband modem of your largest customer remains at your largest remains at your competitor? I asked because some investors have been concerned that reuse could remain if the baseband share remains status quo. I was hoping to get your clarification on that. Thank you.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nSorry, Carl, could you clarify? Did you say our largest customer or the industry? I wasn't sure what you were talking about with the baseband.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nI'm referring to your within the iOS ecosystem, whether if there is a change or no change in the baseband modem, whether you think there's a growing risk of reuse or if you do think there is innovation and continued content gains in that area of the market?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nI want to make sure I understand the question. You're asking if they stay with the Qualcomm baseband and there's been a lot of discussion about them coming out with their own baseband. If they stay with the Qualcomm baseband, what happens to the RF sections? I just want to make sure I understand.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nThat is correct. That is correct. Yes. How do we think about the content opportunity for that? That is correct.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nIt all depends on their future architectures, which I know we don't comment on. But history has been every successive model, there's more and better RF required. So and that includes our tuners, all the other parts that we make for them, better filters to better integrated modules, etcetera. So we don't see a change.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nThe only thing that we've said and we continue to reiterate is that the ETIC that we would be able to provide to the internal platform, we wouldn't provide on Qualcomm platform. So that would be the major difference that you would see for us.\n\n**Karl Ackerman** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nGot it. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my question. Bob, I wanted to kind of come back to this long term growth opportunity for your ACG or mobile business. You mentioned that it could be flattish, I think you said, for fiscal 2026, if I got it right, but then starts to regrow. And my question is, what helps to regrow if it is flattish in a year when you are gaining content right among some of the high end SKUs and when cellular units are expected to grow, then how does it start to regrow until, I don't know, 60 takes off? I guess my real question is how much are you baking in for the continued headwinds from all the China in sourcing and Qualcomm competition?\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nIs it possible ACG business sort of stays flattish for the next several years?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes. Thanks for the question, Vivek. In my prepared remarks, we did talk about us actually being down in ACG for FY 'twenty six to be clear. So we said that we said that HPA and CSG would grow double digits. So that gets you to the company flat.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nAnd we said that we're expecting in our Android business, the category that we talked about last quarter that we'll be exiting be down $150,000,000 to 200,000,000 dollars So you're right, it's going to be a challenge. Therefore, we've got to continue to grow at our largest customer that we've talked about as well as maintain our share in the flagship and high tier phones in the Android ecosystem. So that's our current plan. But in 2026, we were pretty clear it's going to be down.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nOkay. And then maybe a follow-up for Grant on gross margins and OpEx. I think you gave us the gross margin sense for the seasonal quarters and any sense of how the gross margin progresses prior to that? And then I think OpEx you mentioned $250,000,000 How does that kind of progress through the year? Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. Thanks, Vivek. For modeling purposes, you could assume that gross margin will follow the same or roughly approximately the same seasonal pattern that we've seen in the past with June below September December. And I would expect that to continue into fiscal 'twenty six. We're continuing to support the existing commitments that we've made to our Android customers on running platforms And to a degree, in periods where we have higher Android as a percentage of sales, it has a seasonal impact on the gross margin.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSo as we work our way through fiscal 'twenty six and that $150,000,000 to $200,000,000 of revenue related to Android comes out will become less seasonal and expect to be less volatile on our gross margin in addition to increasing as we look into fiscal 2026 into fiscal 20 27. In terms of OpEx, there are some normal seasonal patterns in terms of payroll related items that we'll see in March. Typically, June could be in that same neighborhood based on program development spend. And I would expect the model approximately that level throughout the year, plus or minus, probably approximately $5,000,000 per quarter depending on any of those seasonal impacts.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Managing Director)\nHi. Thank you so much for taking the question. You guys talked quite a bit about some of the restructuring initiatives in motion today or things that you've executed on. You talked about headcount reduction. Obviously, you sold your SiC business and the gas business shifting some production from North Carolina to Oregon.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Managing Director)\nLooking ahead, I don't expect you to share anything that you haven't made public, but would you say you're kind of in the early innings of this journey and sort of rightsizing your company or optimizing your company or are you in the middle late innings? Any commentary on how to think about restructuring over the medium term that would be helpful?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThanks, Toshiya. This is Grant. Let me start with a question and then we can get to your follow-up if one. We're constantly considering ways to optimize our factory footprint. In fact, it's a topic that we regularly consider.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd it shifts with revenue mix and the demand that we're choosing to support over time. The best way to think about it is as we described it at our Investor Day, we'll manufacture internally where it differentiates our product or where a foundry market doesn't exist. Today, filters is a great example where we make those in Richardson and there's not a commercial or merchant market available for those. And then we will outsource to some of our trusted partners where we can mutually benefit from their scale and their technology development. So we can pick and choose the technologies from our outsourced partners that are best suited to our products, both from a performance and cost perspective without having to support each of those individual manufacturing technologies in house.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Managing Director)\nThat's great. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, just on customer concentration with Apple, I guess, flat or growing nicely and your Android business coming down, revenue concentration is growing. All else equal, I think investors typically prefer a diverse revenue stream. I know you guys talked about HPA and CSG outgrowing ACG over the medium to long run.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Managing Director)\nAnd so organically, that concentration should come down over time. But is there a willingness on your part to kind of lean in on M and A to accelerate that diversification process or not so much you prefer to go at it organically? Thanks.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nI'll take this on. In the past, as you know, a lot of our acquisitions have been more technology based and complement product offerings that we already have. We would absolutely be open if we felt we were a better owner and we could significantly increase shareholder value by making a transaction like that. I mean, obviously, we did a good job when we merged the 2 companies of RFMD and TRYCOIN. And if we saw another opportunity to do that, we would certainly be active on that.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nYes. Thank you. Just a question with regard to some of your comments regarding your largest customer on short term and long term. And I know typically there's not much you could say, but you did indicate that you expected your content to grow this year, but then you talked about flat to modestly up increase. I guess I'd interpret that as probably a modest content increase this year.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nSo if you could clarify that. And then longer term, you're going to need growth of that largest customer to grow the ACG business given what you're doing in Android. Maybe you could give us a sense of where the opportunity is for you. Is that just additional content that fits into your traditional strong areas? Or is that going after some market share from some others?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThanks, Chris. This is Grant. Let me take the first part of your question and then maybe Dave or Bob could comment on the future opportunity set. But at our largest customer, there's no changes to the comments that Bob made and I made in December. We're confident in the awards that we have to date and the upcoming fall platform.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd for the year, we expect it to be flat to up modestly there. Volume and mix are always uncertain. And if you want to split it into our fiscal year halves, the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half, and our largest customer will likely to be down in the first half of fiscal twenty twenty six relative to fiscal twenty twenty five and up in the second half of fiscal twenty twenty six relative to the second half of twenty twenty five. So our content is more weighted to the pro models versus the consumer models. So as we pointed out last quarter, the model mix does have an impact on our revenue, but we'll continue to deliver on our strategy of gaining content.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd as the volume falls through revenue, I think we're well positioned there.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nI'll take the second part on what we're working on to grow our share and share of wallet at our largest customer. In the areas we currently support, there's opportunities to gain share. Obviously, we've talked pretty clearly with the group that if they come out with their own modem, their baseband, we believe we'll be able to pick up ETP mix. So that's actually gain in RF content for us. That is taking share from an incumbent.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nAnd then clearly, there's other highly integrated modules that we've been invited to participate in and work towards winning. So that's the playbook that we're laying out for our team.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nGot it. It's helpful. I guess the other question was on the tax rate. And I think what you said is it the tax rate could go to an 18% to 19%, that's a pretty big jump. And if you could clarify that and if it could go that high, what are the dependencies and kind of what's the baseline expectation for the taxes in fiscal 2026?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. So right now, we are approximately 11% and it could go as high as 18% to 19% as we're modeling today. There's opportunities for us to improve and there's a lot of changes that could happen either internationally or here domestically. So it remains again highly uncertain. But to be conservative, right now, we're expecting it to grow to approximately 18% to 19%.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nThanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the color you gave both Bob and Grant. I'm just curious when you look into the first half, your largest customers are expected to release low end smartphone and Samsung is expected to come out of the Galaxy S25. Kind of curious how to think about your content opportunity in those?\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nIs it increasing, decreasing? Any way you can quantify it would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nSorry, we can talk about Galaxy 25 because that's been released. Anything to do with our largest customer that hasn't been released, we're not going to make any comments. But Dave, if you want to take that.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nYes. And when you look at the Galaxy S25 compared to last year, it's very similar. A lot of the highly integrated modules, very similar content we had last year in terms of low band, mid high band and Wi Fi. I think we've talked about this before with their late change in the modem that did impact us just from a time and readiness standpoint on software that we were not able to keep the ultra wideband socket that we had there and some of the tuners. But in general, it's similar content, but slightly reduced year over year because of those factors.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThe only thing I can add at least at our largest customer, we commented that in my opening comments that our content is skewed towards the Pro and Pro Max, not the standard phone that they offer. There's obviously more RF content in those phones, but we have a larger share there.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Very helpful. And then, Bob, just curious, I know you don't participate in the low end tier, but when you look at China smartphones, are your China OEM customers gravitating more towards the premium model now? And if so, how do you think about your opportunity in China with the premium tier Android?\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nYes. In China, I mean, all of our customers, they have global portfolio. They support domestic and overseas markets, and they support from the low end into the high end. And they certainly all have targets to grow in the premium tier as much as they can. And we're supporting them there with our portfolio.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nThe challenge that we've had in that market that we've talked about and the reason we gave the guidance we did on the annual basis is really that mid tier collapsing into the entry tier. And that's the part where we're no longer to participate in, but we'll continue supporting those customers in those premium and flagship tiers.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nThank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nHey guys, thanks for the question. The revenue at your largest customer flat to up, if I understand that correctly, that assumption would include opportunities in the PMIC or Envelope tracker, but does not include any integrated modules that sound like they have not been awarded yet. Is that how we should think about that?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nNo. Our awards today give us confidence as we talked about as a kind of apples to apples basis in the fall models. We feel very confident that we're delivering on our Investor Day promise of gaining content and share there in areas where not only we have strength in the past, but also in areas that we've shared content before and have continued to gain share. So our comments are primarily related to the entire portfolio of products we sell into that customer. I did give some color on the first half versus the second half and how fiscal 'twenty six compares to fiscal 'twenty five, which should give you some indication of how or the timing related to it.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nBut other than that, we can't get into any of the details related to our largest customer and things that haven't yet been released.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nUnderstood. Thank you for that. And in terms of capital, perhaps you can talk about your capital needs looking forward just given you're consolidating some of this footprint? And then in terms of uses of cash moving forward, what your priorities are overall? Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure. Thanks, Chris. So in terms of our uses of cash and the way we think about capital allocation, there's no change. We meet with our Board very regularly to review every quarter. We go through the different needs from working capital to CapEx to organic, inorganic opportunities to invest for growth and retiring debt was one of those that we had been discussing for quite some time.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd then, of course, we're committed to return value to shareholders in the form of our share repurchase. So the waterfall that we look at and review with the Board regularly, no change there. In terms of capital intensity over time, one of the primary rationales for our strategy there is, again, to manufacture in house where it differentiates our products and we'll retain that. It's largely the capacity we need, we have in place. And so we're looking at maintenance CapEx and or any improvements to that process to maintain our differentiation.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nAnd then we will use outside partners in order to leverage their scale and prevent us from having to invest more in our factory network from a CapEx perspective.\n\n**Christopher Rolland** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nThanks so much, Grant.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question will come from Reuben Roy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\n**Ruben Roy** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nYes. Thank you. I guess this question is for Dave. You guys talked a lot about the D and A momentum here. I was wondering if you could maybe spend a few minutes on some of the other segments, industrial, enterprise, infrastructure.\n\n**Ruben Roy** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nIt's nice to hear the stabilization in areas like broadband. What's the visibility like that we've seen a lot and heard a lot of mixed data points for these end markets? I'm just wondering if you talk about the design activity environment and your visibility. We appreciate the sort of the longer term guidance by segment, but would love to hear a little more about visibility into, I guess, sustainability and how you're thinking about growth trajectories as you flow through fiscal 2026 in those areas? Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nYes, definitely in some of\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nthose markets near term, we see the weakness in the demand of existing running programs like in automotive and industrial. And so but we're still growing from a relatively small base in a lot of the businesses that we're engaged there. And it's a lot of new content that we're addressing. So from a forward looking standpoint, we're pretty excited about the opportunities that we have there, the growth in our funnel of opportunities and the engagements that we have in customers. So we've talked about in enterprise, the upgrade of Wi Fi to Wi Fi 7 and the opportunities that we have in adding ultra wideband for indoor navigation and real time location services.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nSo that's all going well. Bob mentioned some of the ramps we have going on this year. And then in power management, we've got some good engagements there as we move in our from our solid state drive business more into the enterprise segment. We've got good content growth opportunities moving forward there. In automotive, we've definitely seen ultra wideband adoption really starting to take off across all end customers and all the Tier 1.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nSo the engagement there has been really strong and we expect to see ultra wideband adoption happening over the next 3 to 5 years. And we expect to be one of the leaders in that market. So that's a great opportunity for us. And one part we didn't talk about in defense is in the SATCOM business. That's been a bright spot as well.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nAnd so when you look at these satellites that are going up in a LEO satellite, we could have 1,000 of dollars of content every time one of those gets deployed in the space. And when you look at the direct to sell, that's more like a base station in space. So we could have tens of 1,000 of dollars for content of content per satellite. So those are great growth opportunities for us in our defense market even outside of the traditional defense business.\n\n**Ruben Roy** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nThanks, Steve. If I could ask hopefully a quick follow-up for Grant. Just thinking through maybe a little bit longer term investment into OpEx and you talked about repurposing some of the savings into some areas like you just talked about. But I'm wondering as you think about sort of focusing on your large customer in ACG, should we expect any meaningful change of mix in OpEx ACG versus the other 2 segments? Or do you think it will be kind of steady state longer term?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nWe're looking at OpEx improvement across the company, not necessarily within any given operating segment. There's a lot of shared resources across the company that are allocated based on the size of the business and how much effort is put in by the support functions. So when we think about OpEx, it's across the entire company. It's the most recent workforce reduction that was in certain cases specific to Android as we think about our product roadmap and as we look forward, which products we were going to develop and support, and we took appropriate action to reflect the revenue change in fiscal 2026 and 2027 that we discussed today.\n\n**Ruben Roy** (Managing Director - Equity Research)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThe next question will come from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. I just want to dig down a little bit more on the guidance for the fall, Joe, or just customer and what your assumptions are there. We assume units are flat and the Pro Max split is the same as it was last year. I just want to be clear that you're guiding for content gains. And if those count gains, how much does that include, let's say, leasing 2 different SKUs with 2 different modems?\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nBecause I know it seems based on your comments, Bob, that you're pretty confident your content is going to go up on an internally developed modem just for the ETP mix alone. I just want to make sure those assumptions are correct to start off with. Thanks.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThanks, Ed. As far as if there's an internal modem, yes, we're very confident. Our ETP NIC will be in there. As far as the content we've already been awarded, I think we've pretty much said already, we believe in that. We did not comment on how many modems they're going to use or anything for their year, but I'm very confident in our belief that we're going to gain content this year based on what we've already been awarded.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nOkay. So the awards, if everything else was held constant, you'll see content increases based on awards itself, right?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nOkay, great. And then if I could, on the defense side of the business, it sounds like these are going very well and it's been your kind of the probably the best business you've had consistently overall. Do you anticipate much change? I know you just mentioned LEO's and that's through defense too, but do you anticipate much change coming up from some of the spending that we're talking about for all the fallout from the Ukraine war? Are they talking about AASA's?\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nBut more importantly, you're talking about a lot of the stuff with the drones. I'm not sure exactly how Coralville plays into that in terms of the radar systems for it. Maybe you can provide a little bit of color just to get an idea because I know there are long term plans, but I was just trying to get a feel for how that impacts you or if it does.\n\n**Dave Fullwood** (Senior Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing)\nYes. And it's largely driven by the upgrade of those radar systems from mechanical to the AESA radars like you mentioned. And so yes, that's a fantastic content opportunity and we're closely engaged with all the primes and leaders in the market there. So yes, we see for an ESA airborne radar going on planes that we have 100 of 1,000 of dollars of opportunities and for a ground based system up to $1,000,000 of content per system. So it's definitely a growth area for us and something we're very, very focused on.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nIt still has a lot of GaN content, right? Absolutely.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nYes, it does, Ed. So we'd say if it's radar in the plane, out in sea or in land, we're already in it and if it grows, we'll grow nicely.\n\n**Edward Snyder** (Managing Director)\nPerfect. Thanks, guys.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nThank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThanks, Ed.\n\n**Operator**\nYour next question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nHi, Bob and Grant. Just on the China side, I mean, there's a move looks like for the China handset OEMs to move to mid and low end because of the subsidies that the China government was giving. Once you exit the low end Android, how much exposure would you have to the China market?\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nSure, Vijay. So we had said on a run rate from a China Android perspective, we are right around that $100,000,000 per quarter mark and we would expect to track down to the $50,000,000 level, plus or minus.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nGot it. And then, as you move your mix more to just the top two customers, Is that a risk given it's much more a sandbox and you start to compete. I'm sure that your peers have a kind of a pretty similar strategy. Does that make that sandbox fairly very competitive and constrictive again?\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nI would say today, they're both very competitive. Nothing's really changed there. Our largest customer as well as at our 2nd largest customer, I mean, that's what we've been dealing with for the last 10 years at Qorvo. So we're not seeing much change there in that sense. The real change has been, as we've been talking about in China, that mid tier, which was a great place where we made a lot of money over the years, has really downshifted as consumers looking for more entry level phones. That's been the big change.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Grant Brown** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\n**Robert Bruggeworth** (President and Chief Executive Officer)\nWe want to thank everyone for joining us on tonight's call. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to speaking with many of you at upcoming investor events. Thanks again. Hope you have a great evening.",
