Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mike Sullivan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. With me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call includes forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures can be found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. With that introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nWelcome back, Mike. Applied Materials delivered fiscal fourth quarter results above the midpoint of our guidance to complete another record year. 2025 was our sixth consecutive year of growth, and over this period, we have grown revenue and earnings at annualized rates of approximately 12% and 20%. These results are made possible by our passionate and dedicated employees around the world. Over the past 12 months, we have built new capabilities, strengthened our product portfolio, and streamlined our organization to prepare for the opportunities ahead. Applied is in a tremendous position to benefit as AI computing fuels secular growth in semiconductors and wafer fab equipment.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nAs this is our year-end call, I'll begin with a brief review of our performance in 2025, then I'll provide our latest market outlook, and finally, I'll describe how our inflection-focused innovation strategy enables us to extend our leadership in the most valuable and fastest-growing areas of the market as next-generation technologies ramp in volume production in 2026 and beyond. Looking back at fiscal 2025, while it was a growth year for Applied, our growth rate was tempered due to increased trade restrictions and an unfavorable market mix. Over the past 12 months, multiple trade rule changes have reduced the size of our accessible market in China. Overall, China declined to 28% of our total systems and service revenues in fiscal 2025 and to 25% for our fourth quarter.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nIn 2026, we expect wafer fab equipment spending in China to be lower, and we are not anticipating significant changes to market restrictions. In the areas of the market where we can operate, we are competing well and maintaining market share. Outside of China, the fastest-growing areas of the market in 2025 were segments where Applied had low or no share. In leading-edge foundry logic, investment was more oriented toward advanced lithography. We believe this is a positive leading indicator for process equipment demand in 2026. NAND, where historically Applied has lower market share, is on track to approximately double in 2025, even though it remains a relatively small portion of the wafer fab equipment market. In DRAM, where Applied has strong process technology leadership, overall spending is tracking to be approximately flat for calendar 2025.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nNevertheless, we strengthened our leadership position in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50% over the past four fiscal quarters. As we look ahead to 2026, we expect the spending mix to play more to Applied's strengths, with leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and advanced packaging being the fastest-growing areas of the market. I recently returned from an extended trip to Asia. My discussions with customers and partners reinforce my view that opportunities for the semiconductor industry and Applied Materials have never been greater. Our customers are engaging with us to ensure we are ready to support significant production ramps in the coming years. AI has reached a tipping point that is accelerating investment in next-generation computing infrastructure and advanced silicon. Today, we are seeing a virtuous cycle of innovation and demand.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nAdvances in performance, energy consumption, and cost of AI computing open up new AI applications that, in turn, significantly increase demand for AI compute capacity. Recent third-party forecasts predict that the semiconductor industry will grow at a compound annual rate between 10%-15% over the next five years, driving a healthy increase in wafer fab equipment spending. We expect 2026 to be another growth year for Applied with our revenue being weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. AI computing is not only fueling growth but also reshaping the semiconductor roadmap and changing the way chips are designed and manufactured. Foundational semiconductor technology plays a critical role in increasing performance and bringing down the cost of AI in the data center and at the edge.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nToday, major technology inflections are underway in five key areas: leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory or DRAM stacking, advanced packaging for heterogeneous integration, and power electronics. At Applied, our core strategy is inflection-focused innovation. We partner with our customers to see technology inflections early. We focus our research and development on the most critical and valuable challenges on their roadmaps using deep co-innovation engagement models, and we create highly differentiated solutions by connecting our broad portfolio of capabilities and technologies. The three products we recently launched at SEMICON West are great examples of how this strategy works. Our new Xtera epitaxy system enables higher-performance gate-all-around transistors for two nanometers and beyond. Xtera creates void-free source drain structures that provide higher transistor speeds that are especially critical for AI computing.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nThe Xtera system integrates Epi cleaning, and etch, resulting in a 40% improvement in uniformity and 50% lower gas usage compared to traditional Epi. Kinex is the industry's first integrated die-to-wafer bonder. Hybrid bonding enables significant improvement in performance, power consumption, and costs for both complex multi-chip packages and die stacking. Kinex is a six-step integrated system with onboard metrology that provides higher accuracy bonding, smaller interconnect pitches, and higher yields for new logic and memory packaging architectures. PROVision 10 is designed to improve yield in 3D devices and further extends our leadership in eBeam metrology. eBeam metrology is critical for 3D devices as it can see through multiple layers of 3D chips and provide multi-layer images to identify defects in buried structures.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nThis system is the first to use cold field emission technology for metrology, which increases image resolution by 50% and imaging speed 10x compared to conventional thermal field emission technology. Overall, Applied is very well positioned at the most valuable technology inflections and in areas of the market that will grow fastest as AI is deployed on a large scale. The process tool-of-record positions that we have established over the past several years give us confidence that we will extend our strong leadership position in logic, DRAM, and packaging as advanced technology nodes ramp in volume production. Another key theme we consistently hear from our customers and our customers' customers is that co-optimization of the technology stack is more critical than ever. We are expanding our deep multi-year co-innovation engagements that focus on system technology co-optimization.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nOur high-velocity co-innovation model provides chipmakers and chip designers much earlier access to next-generation process technology to accelerate their new chip and system architectures. This is a core value proposition of Applied Materials' equipment and process innovation and commercialization platform, or EPIC. Construction of the platform's flagship facility, the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley, is on track, and we are excited to begin operations next year. Our co-optimization strategies extend well beyond R&D. As our customers race to bring these complex new device architecture inflections to market, we are providing advanced service solutions that help them rapidly transfer new technology into their pilot lines and then rapidly optimize device performance, yield, and cost in volume production. In 2025, our core service business delivered another year of double-digit growth, with more than two-thirds of our service revenue generated from subscriptions.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nIn AGS and across Applied, we are rapidly adopting AI and digital tools. This enables us to drive higher velocity and productivity, innovate the way we work, and streamline our organization to meet the opportunities ahead. Before I hand over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Fiscal 2025 was our sixth consecutive year of growth, even as trade restrictions and an unfavorable market mix trimmed our growth rate for the year. As we look ahead, large-scale AI adoption will drive substantial investment in AI computing infrastructure, including advanced semiconductors and wafer fab equipment. Applied's inflection-focused innovation strategy positions us for another record year in 2026 as we gain share at the highest-value technology inflections in the fastest-growing areas of the market. As next-generation technologies ramp in volume production over the coming years, we will extend our leadership in logic, DRAM, and packaging. Brice, over to you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you, Gary, and thanks everyone for joining today's call. I am pleased that Applied delivered record annual revenue, gross margin dollars, operating profit, and earnings per share in fiscal 2025. Looking ahead into 2026, I believe we are in great position to benefit from favorable market trends. Based on growing demand for AI data center capacity, we forecast that leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and high-bandwidth memory will be the fastest-growing areas of the semiconductor equipment market. We have strong leadership positions in these segments today, and we have targeted our R&D investments to create new products and technologies that will enable even faster and more energy-efficient transistors, chips, and systems and drive growth for Applied. In addition, we have been working closely with our customers to better understand their longer-term demand expectations and align our supply chain and manufacturing slots to meet their needs for advanced capacity.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nBased on our conversations with our customers and other industry players, we are preparing our operations and service organizations to be ready to support higher demand beginning in the second half of calendar 2026. Next, I'll briefly summarize our fiscal 2025 results versus fiscal 2024. Revenue grew 4% to $28.4 billion, with growth across all of our segments. Semiconductor systems revenue was up 4%, growing even as the impact of trade restrictions significantly reduced our access to the market in China. The impact of these restrictions was equivalent to around 10% of the China market in fiscal 2024 and more than double that amount in fiscal 2025. On a global basis, we generated record foundry systems revenue along with record DRAM sales outside China, and we posted record revenue in both Taiwan and Korea. Applied Global Services revenue grew 3% to a record $6.4 billion.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThe recurring parts, services, and software portion of AGS grew by double digits in the year, while the 200-millimeter equipment business declined. We grew display revenue by 20%. I am pleased that we increased non-GAAP gross margin by 120 basis points to 48.8%, the highest level in 25 years. We shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly, helping to more than offset cost increases. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 5%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in R&D investments. At the end of the year, we announced actions to reduce headcount and enable us to scale Applied more productively as we capture the growth opportunities we see in 2026 and beyond. We continue to shift spending to strategic areas, adding people in fields like advanced analytics that are critical to the speed and efficiency of our R&D programs and operations.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nNon-GAAP earnings per share increased 9%. We generated nearly $8 billion in cash from operations. Free Cash Flow of $5.7 billion included elevated capital spending of $2.3 billion, over half of which was used in building the new EPIC Center in Silicon Valley, which will open next year and become the most advanced collaborative semiconductor equipment and process innovation facility in the world. We distributed approximately $6.3 billion to shareholders. We paid $1.4 billion in cash dividends, and the quarterly dividend per share was increased by 15% during the year to $0.46. Operating income from Applied Global Services more than covered the dividend payment. We allocated $4.9 billion to our share repurchase program and reduced shares outstanding by more than 3%. Turning to fiscal Q4, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of guidance.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nChina revenue declined to 29% of total company revenue, which is in line with our longer-term average and well below a peak of 45% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP gross margin was at the midpoint of guidance and up 60 basis points year-over-year, while non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly higher than our expectation and up 3% year-over-year. Turning to the segments, semiconductor systems and AGS revenue exceeded our expectations for the quarter, while non-GAAP operating margin for both segments declined along with revenue on a year-on-year basis. Lastly, display revenue exceeded our expectation for the quarter and was up 68% year-over-year. Next, I'll share several reporting changes we are making that will help us drive further efficiency gains and also give investors more visibility into our semiconductor and services businesses.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nFirst, as of Q4 fiscal 2025, our display business is being reported in corporate and other. There is no change to our display strategy. Next, as of Q1 fiscal 2026, we are moving our 200-millimeter equipment business from Applied Global Services to semiconductor systems. This change will increase our operational efficiency and enable investors to see all of our semiconductor systems revenue in one place. Also, as a result, Applied Global Services will consist entirely of recurring revenue. This will make it easier for investors to track our subscription-like growth in services. Finally, as of Q1 of fiscal 2026, we are fully allocating corporate support costs to our businesses. This change will have the effect of reducing semiconductor systems and AGS operating margins, but also give our teams better visibility and opportunity to optimize these costs.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nNow, I'll share our guidance for Q1, which includes the reporting changes I just outlined. We expect company revenue of $6.85 billion+ or -$500 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.18+ or -$0.20. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue of around $5.025 billion. AGS should generate revenue of around $1.52 billion. Corporate and other revenue should be around $305 million, composed primarily of display revenue. We currently expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 48.4% in Q1 and remain at that level until volumes ramp to support higher demand beginning in the second half of the calendar year. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be around $1.33 billion, which is up only slightly from fiscal Q4 because the actions we recently took are mostly offsetting the increase we normally see in Q1 due to the timing of annual merit increases and equity compensation expenses.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nFinally, we are modeling a tax rate of around 13%. In summary, our customers are indicating to us that wafer fab equipment spending is likely to accelerate beginning in the second half of calendar 2026. In addition, we see a positive fab equipment spending mix developing for Applied. AI data center investments translate to strong demand for our most enabling products in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and high-bandwidth memory, along with advanced services that help our customers accelerate ramps and yields. Thank you for listening, and now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up question. Operator, let's please begin.\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly, and our first question comes from the line of CJ Muse Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please. Yeah, good afternoon.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nThank you for taking the question. I guess, Gary, the world has clearly changed since NVIDIA reported August 26th and discussed $3 trillion-$4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending. Curious, given your trip to visit with clients over the very near term, how your conversations have evolved in the last few months? How has your visibility changed, and how are you preparing your supply chain for this likely tremendous growth?\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nHi, CJ. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I have been spending a lot of time with customers and just came back from a long trip to Asia. I would say I was meeting with the R&D leaders and CEOs of our largest customers. Just like you said, AI is the biggest focus for all of our customers.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nIt's driving the WFE mix to segments driven by AI, including leading-edge foundry logic and DRAM, where Applied has strong number one positions. Applied is in deep, high-velocity co-innovation relationships with all of these different customers. We have very high share. If you look at the transistor for Gate-All-Around or Backside Power and leading-edge foundry logic, we have very strong visibility and co-innovation relationships with customers over four technology nodes, a decade out in the future. Very high visibility in terms of our positions in leading-edge foundry logic and in DRAM, and high confidence we're going to outperform as those advanced chips ramp going forward in the future. The other thing that I heard and we've been seeing over the last couple of months is a major improvement in customer demand visibility.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nCustomers, just like you said, they're planning large ramps of advanced factories, and they want to make sure our supply chain operations and service teams are ready to deliver. We're getting more than one year visibility, in some cases two years visibility with a number of these different customers because, as we talked about in the prepared remarks in the second half of 2026, we will see significant ramps for these advanced factories. Again, customers want to make sure that especially our supply chains are ready to deliver. Of course, the improved visibility is critical to our ability to ensure on-time delivery to customer needs. I'd say that's, CJ, the biggest thing that's changed in the last couple of months.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nVery helpful. Maybe, Brice, you announced the headcount reduction over the last quarter.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nI'm curious how we should think about that and the implications to gross margins and OpEx into first half calendar of 2026, perhaps versus second half given the ramp that you've talked about. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, thanks, CJ. Good to hear from you. On the reduction, if you look at our Q1 spend in our guide, you'll see that we do not have the uplift that we typically have in Q1 for our annual pay raises and the share-based compensation increases that typically happen. You'll be able to quantify the rough change in that quarter from that perspective. Just to highlight, that was a years-long program that we worked on to increase velocity and productivity across the company. For the balance of 2026, we'll add back some skills that we need to fill in for the company.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nIt was really a wholesale evaluation of all the staffing model we have across the entire company.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nYeah, CJ, maybe I'll add another aspect to this. In strategic planning, we had a big focus on innovating the way we work, including AI and digital technologies, and driving, like Brice said, higher velocity and productivity. That is really at the foundation of how companies compete. Huge focus, especially on velocity across all of Applied Materials, and then streamlining our organization to optimize future performance. As we went through these changes, we also wanted to make sure, as I talked about, we see significant demand coming from our customers. We wanted to make sure as we are doing this overall company and workforce optimization to improve the performance of Applied, we are also ready to meet those major customer ramps in the second half of 2026 and then going forward.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. Gary, my first question is, as you mentioned, you're clearly gaining share in new technologies like Gate All-Around and Backside Power Delivery. When I look at your leadership products, it seems like PVD is moving to ALD on the CVD, CMP, and etch side. Besides the usual U.S. and Japanese competitors, there's increasing domestic China competition. I'm kind of curious how to think about the momentum in those leadership products for the next two to three years as you see increasing competition both globally and from China. I have a follow-up for Brice.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nOkay, Krish, there's a lot in that first question, but thank you for the question. We have very strong positions, Gate All-Around, Backside Power.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nBesides being number one in process equipment for leading logic and foundry, we're also number one in DRAM and advanced packaging, especially for high-bandwidth memory. Those are the most important segments for AI energy-efficient computing. Leading-edge foundry logic and DRAM will be the fastest-growing segments in 2026 and for the next several years. Krish, we're performing well across all our products. Again, I am extremely confident that we will grow share, especially in these segments that are enabling AI energy-efficient computing. We have deep relationships with all of these different customers across multiple technology nodes. We see strong demand for our products, increasing demand for integrated systems, for transistors, wiring, and now Kinex for packaging. All of that, I'm very optimistic about. I'll come back to your PVD comment in just a minute here.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nThe biggest change we've seen in our competitive position in the near term is trade restrictions. We used to serve the entire global WFE market before restrictions were implemented. By 2024, we were restricted from serving around 10% of China's WFE market, mainly in leading-edge logic and the domestic NAND market. In the last month of 2024 and the first month of 2025, the restrictions significantly increased for us, and we could no longer serve China's DRAM market and some of the ICAPS market. Our impact grew to well over 20% of the China WFE market, which I think everybody knows that the WFE market in China has been elevated this year and also over the past few years with China approaching 40% of total WFE. This change in restrictions was a very big impact, especially in 2025.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nNon-U.S. equipment companies do not have the same restrictions. Restricted customers can buy from those companies even if they would rather buy from Applied. We have put a lot of time and studied this topic very carefully. What we can see is that where we can compete, we are doing very well. If I look at China going forward, our business has returned to normalized levels. We talked about kind of mid-20s on our semi business, our systems, and AGS. Looking ahead, we do not anticipate significant new restrictions. In fact, we believe that our share in China ICAPS, where we can compete, was flat from 2024-2025. That is across, Krish, all of our different leadership products. We think we can continue to hold and have an opportunity to even gain share going forward.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nI say this because we have several major ICAPS new products coming for China and non-China that add to the strong products we have today, enabling us to enter new ICAPS markets and also better compete in cost-sensitive areas of the market. We will increase our ICAPS addressable market opportunity in China and worldwide. Again, where we can compete, I'm actually very optimistic with our position. Back to PVD, your question on PVD. I'll tell you, Krish, PVD is doing great where we can compete. We grew PVD in 2025. We have a positive outlook in 2026 and into the future. I talked earlier about AI. PVD is enabling low-resistance wiring, and that's critical for faster and more energy-efficient chips. With advanced chips, you have hundreds of miles of wiring in a single chip.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nIf you could imagine, that long wire keeps getting thinner and thinner, and moving data through that wire at high speed with low power is incredibly hard, almost like magic. Applied is the clear leader in wiring innovation. Krish, we see strong demand for PVD, strong growth into 2026 and into the future. We are also innovating. I talked about that pipeline of innovative products. We have new PVD innovations specifically for ICAPS beyond all of the other things that we are doing that will help us in performance in that particular segment. The last thing, in the leading edge, we do have an increase in demand for the integrated products, including selective ALD and selective Moly, which we just had some big wins in the most critical applications. Long answer, Krish.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nThank you very much, Gary. No, it is extremely helpful and very informative.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nThanks for that. Just a quick follow-up for Brice. Brice, how do you think about the impact of this 200-millimeter movement from AGS to Semi? Is there a way to quantify it for Q1, or how much was it in fiscal year 2025? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, it's approximately $125 million, Krish, for Q1 and approximately the same number in Q4. We're moving that from our services business to our equipment business. We think that'll be easier for us to manage and easier for investors to understand those two different reportable segments.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot, Brice. Thanks, Gary.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThank you for taking the question. You mentioned you expect fiscal 2026 mix to work in your favor. You also mentioned the significant growth in the back half.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nI'm curious, do you think there is a potential for WFE to grow high single-digit, close to double-digit next year and for Applied to outperform that? Because you do seem to have better visibility, and you also expect the mix to work in your favor. I'm just hoping that if you could give us some sense of what the market could be doing and how is Applied positioned with respect to that market.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHi, Vivek. It's Brice. Thanks for your question. We do expect strong growth in 2026 led by leading edge and DRAM. The headwind that we have, we do still expect some digestion in China and in ICAPS. It is kind of a similar situation relative to 2025. We think leading edge will be very strong. DRAM will be very strong. These are pulled by the headline of the AI solutions in those spaces.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nAnd then a little bit of digestion on the ICAPS side, but we do think it will be a growth year.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nOkay. On the clarification side, Brice, how much of the $600 million BIS headwind is in Q1 and the rest of the year? And if I could squeeze in the real question for Gary, one of your peers suggested an $8 billion or so, I think WFE for every $100 billion or so in data center build-out. Do you agree with that number? Do you have a different number? And how do you see the mix within that $8 billion playing to Applied's strength?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you. Okay, Vivek. Starting with the affiliate rule that came out and affected our Q4 and then was suspended. We had shared that $110 million would be affected in our Q4.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe did not ship that in Q4, but we will ship that in Q1. The first answer is that is included in our guide for Q1. The $600 million is still a good estimate for what is in the rest of 2026. We did not share any linearity for that. In fact, it is still being closed in terms of delivery dates, etc. I would think of that as through the rest of the year. On the WFE per gigawatt, we spent some time thinking about this. We think the best way to think about this is about 15% of leading-edge wafer starts and DRAM wafer starts are allocated towards AI data center solutions. If you think about capacity planning, that is growing at a mid 30% CAGR across the industry. Today, 15% of those two end markets are growing at mid 30%.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nFor companies that are planning capacity for two and three years out, they make that projection, and that much WFE should be allocated towards data center. We can talk more about that in a follow-up, but I think that is a good way to think about how much is being allocated.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nHi, Vivek. You asked about what does that mean, the AI demand mean for mix and for Applied. I talked about this earlier, that the two fastest-growing segments for 2026 and going forward are leading-edge foundry logic and DRAM, including high-bandwidth memory. In both of those cases, again, we are clear number one. We are gaining share, high visibility in Gate All-Around. That will become clear as those advanced factories ramp in the latter half of 2026. We have very strong visibility, very strong position. The same thing is true with DRAM.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nI think longer term, if you look at Gate-All-Around, Backside Power, we're positioned to capture more than 50% of our served market. I have high confidence that we are gaining share in Gate-All-Around. I mean, that's all of the discussions I had with these R&D leaders when I was in Asia in the last month. In DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, we're in really great position there. We've gained a significant amount of share over the last several years. As FinFET ramps, we have strong leadership in FinFET. That's going to be adopted in DRAM, 4F-squared. We also are in a great position. In HBM, future generations will adopt hybrid bonding where we also have clear leadership. We announced Kinex at SEMICON West. The mix is definitely working in our favor, and we're well positioned going forward.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, Brice, this second-half lift in demand. What does that imply for the trajectory in the first half? Are you thinking revenue stays kind of in this ballpark until we hit the second half, or does it grow a little bit and then it grows a lot? Maybe even if you wanted to quantify second-half versus first-half split or something like that. How do we think about the first half relative to the second half given the lift in the second half?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, for the semi business, Stacy, and thanks for the question. For the semi business, we think it'll be flattish until we see that growth. We will see a little growth in the AGS business.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe expect that, as we've shared, to be growing at low double digits, and that's fairly continuous growth through the course of the year. For the semi business in the short term, it'll be flattish.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nUntil like Q3, I guess you're thinking, or?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, for us, it'll really be our Q4 and our Q1 of next year. That's when the calendar, that's when it matches the calendar. We'll see a, we expect a significant uplift there from leading edge, especially. Until then, it'll be slower growth.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nOkay. I guess for my follow-up, you sort of mentioned gross margins kind of staying in this range until we see that lift. Do you expect a material lift in gross margins when that material lift in revenue comes through?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nHow do we expect the gross margin trajectory on the back of those revenues as that comes through second half of next year?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, the 48.4% guide for Q1 is good for this level of business. I'll just highlight in Q1, we're also expecting a normal share from a China shipment perspective. It should be for the whole company, it should be in the order of 29% and less than that for AGS and our Semi business. That level, without a significant uplift in the business, that's good for this size business. When we do get to the second half, added volume will help with cost improvements. Over time, we continue to work on our pricing and cost programs. You can see with the 120 basis point uplift that we had in 2025, most of that was driven by price improvement.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe will continue with that program, but it takes time to affect the margins.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nStacy, this is Gary. One thing I would say in terms of margins, I do think that we will be able to drive sustainable improvements in margins over time. I mean, one thing in the industry, you see a tremendous amount of profits being generated with the AI demand throughout the entire ecosystem. Our customer profitability has improved significantly. As I mentioned earlier, also, we are enabling these incredible innovations. I mentioned the hundreds of miles of wiring in an advanced chip. I mean, again, for AI, this is incredibly valuable. As we continue to work with our customers, enabling those innovations that are critical for AI, bringing new products to market, I believe that we can sustainably drive our margins higher going forward.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment)\nGot it. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Brice, I'm trying to understand China a little better. All these affiliates were banned, and then they got reinstated. The way that China usually operates is that when they were rushing to get in front of the ban, and now I would think that they're going to come back and they're going to just try to get as much equipment as they can, as fast as they can. Is the add-back not going to be more than 600 tools? In fiscal Q1, are you taking slots away from the other customers to give to them? I guess I'm trying to figure out how we do not add more than 600 tools back the way that these Chinese customers typically operate.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThanks for the question, Tim.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, for the first quarter, 110 tools is in the quarter. Those tools are built and will ship. For the balance, we were not building those tools. We did not know we would be able to ship them. It is going to take time to do the supply chain and actually make the builds. We will have to finalize the date with the customers. They may have interest in working that process as quickly as possible, but I would just say the good way to think about this is cycle time, and we will spread it through the year.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay. I guess, Gary, I wanted to go back to PVD. This is like a third of your systems revenue per Gartner. It is a super important piece of your business. It does seem a little bit like ALD is eating into this franchise a little bit.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nI know it's super important. It's been growing. How do you sort of protect that franchise from you have one franchise you're very strong in, and one where your share is not as high? Do you think that we're all kind of maybe too concerned about the degree to which ALD is eating into PVD?\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nThanks. Hey, Tim, thanks for the question. I absolutely think you're too concerned. Again, as I mentioned, I just spent a lot of time in Asia with our R&D leaders for our top customers. We have deep visibility into their technology roadmaps for four generations. I can tell you, again, we have high confidence. PVD is going to continue to ramp. I mentioned the hundreds of miles of wiring in an advanced chip. We have innovations that are really amazing innovations. We are the leader in wiring.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nIf you think about an AI server, again, how you move the data at a very high speed with low power is enormously important. That is within a chip, chip to chip. There is so much innovation that is happening there. I do not know where this comes from on the ALD eating PVD share, that type of thing. All I can say is that we have extremely high visibility. We have unique technologies, including PVD, and we have unique ability to combine technologies into integrated platforms. One of those integrated platforms, we combine selective ALD together with PVD and five other technologies. That is part of what is enabling those hundreds of miles of wiring. Applied is really unique in being able to deliver those kinds of innovations. That is enabling 50% improvement in resistivity. It is a billion-dollar business for us every year. That is going to continue.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nAgain, deep visibility into the N+1, N+2, N+3, N+4 technology nodes. Another innovation that we just won with leading foundry logic companies is integrating selective Moly with PVD into an integrated platform for the most critical applications for our customers. Again, Tim, very high visibility. I agree with you. It's a great business. It's going to keep growing in 2026 and keep growing as we go forward.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nOkay, Gary. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aatif Malik from Citi. Your question, please.\n\n**Aatif Malik** (SVP)\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. Welcome back, Mike. Brice, I'm just trying to understand the China commentary. You're expecting China to kind of stay at this mid 20%s level for the silicon products into next year.\n\n**Aatif Malik** (SVP)\nIf the assumption is that the domestic China spending is coming down next year, why would this number not be lower than mid 25% if the rest of China is growing? I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYes. Thanks, Aatif. For Q1, that just happens to be what's in the mix. We do expect it. If we do have the digestion that we're expecting in China, then we will see it lower during the course of the year. That will be more than offset to get a growth here. That will be more than offset by the strength in leading edge and DRAM that we highlighted earlier. I'll just admit, I think we've been wrong for two years in a row forecasting a digestion related to China, and it's been stronger each year. We could be surprised on the upside as we go through.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nRight now, Gary mentioned this a few minutes ago. China has been almost 40% of WFE. It's been elevated. They've been investing heavily to get to self-sustainability from a production perspective. We don't have as good a visibility because of a large number of customers there and continuing creation of new customers. It's not as easy to forecast as the rest of the mature market.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nYeah. I'll just add one thing I would say also. Longer term, what we think is that ICAPS remains about one-third of WFE, and then you have memory and leading-edge foundry logic. China is really mostly an ICAPS market, and there has been this elevated spending over multiple years. We think that if you just look at end market demand, we think that moves back into that zip code over a longer period of time.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nWhen that happens, hard to anticipate exactly when that's going to happen, but that's what we think about over a longer period.\n\n**Aatif Malik** (SVP)\nGreat. Gary, one for you. You visited several customers. Are your memory customers constrained by shell capacity? I mean, why are we talking about a second-half inflection or the first half? I mean, I understand the first half is being dragged lower by China, but is there a situation where the memory guys are constrained by shell capacity? That explains why second half is going higher?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI can take the question, Aatif. First, we would say that factory schedules, of course, matter. Each customer has their own schedule for installation and ramp and qualification and the like.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nOur information on the macro level, we had several people ask this question, but our information on the macro level suggests that there is factory capacity from a space perspective to ramp across the industry. You will just have to ask each customer. That is a macro answer. You will have to ask each customer for their situation. We do not think the capacity is limiting the ramp at this point.\n\n**Aatif Malik** (SVP)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Your question, please.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on China. You did mention outside of restrictions, you are not losing share, but your U.S. peer, the closest one, reported much stronger China revenue growth this year. I think they are probably growing at a 20% year-on-year. You are probably declining more than 10% year-on-year.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Managing Director and Senior Analyst)\nJust really trying to reconcile, how are you not losing share? Is there some nuances that we may be missing and that would suggest you actually did not lose share in China despite the numbers would suggest otherwise? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHi, Charles. I'll start on this one. I think the nuance, we clarified that, or we made an adjustment in there and said, if we look at the accounts that we can support, we're holding our share and competing well in China. If you just take the macro number, we've certainly lost share in China. I think Gary commented that if you go back to 2024, just over 10% of the market was restricted for U.S. companies. If you go to 2025, it's more than doubled. The restriction has more than doubled.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe have certainly lost share in China because a larger portion of the market is inaccessible to us. When we look at the accounts that we can sell to, we feel we are competing very well.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nYeah, Charles, this is Gary. I think we have done a lot of work on this. There are lots of different sources of data that can cross-validate the numbers. Again, when we look at it, we cannot comment on other people, their ability to serve global customers that are in China versus domestic customers. Everybody is going to have a little difference in terms of what they are serving in China. Certainly for us, NAND, the global NAND in China, is not a significant business. DRAM, however, which really was restricted at the beginning of our fiscal year, we have very high share in DRAM.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nIf you look at the top leading DRAM companies in this last year, I think our business was up something like 50%. For Applied, DRAM going away had a really big impact on us. Again, Charles, I think we have pretty good confidence in maintaining share where we can compete, but there is going to be a different mix for every company. I do not know, Brice, if you want to add anything else.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nNo, I think that covers it.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nYeah. The other thing that I would add to that, Charles, is the other part of that is not only the DRAM, but it is the NAND. If you think about it, what was shipping? You have multinational NAND companies that are in China, and they were presumably pretty strong. As you may know, in our mix, that is the lowest area for us.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nGary talked about the DRAM impact. The other impact is NAND being strong. That equation in the future on a global basis, we think, is changing.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us understand just what was the size of the advanced packaging business in fiscal 2025, and how did that grow?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHi, Joe. It's Brice. It's a little bit lower than it was in 2024. 2024 was buoyed by the high shipments in the end of the year for HBM. It's essentially been running at the same level for 2025, minus that extra shipments at the end of that year.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nAs we look forward, Gary is going to comment about the changing technologies for advanced packaging over time. We think we are well-positioned for that. We still think that business will be growing significantly along with AI data center and all the different packaging capabilities that will be required over time.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nYeah, Joe. Applied is number one in high-bandwidth memory. That business was not as strong in 2025 as it was the previous year. That was one thing that impacted our relative growth rate. It is pretty close to flat year-over-year, 2025 versus 2024, with the HBM coming down versus where it was. What I would say is that we are still on track to what we have discussed before. We have grown the business from around $500 million to about $1.5 billion today.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nWe are on track still to double this business to $3 billion or more over the next few years. We are in a very good position. As I said earlier, we are number one in HBM. As HBM ramps over time, that puts us in a good position. We have a great portfolio of products. Especially, I mentioned the trip in Asia and meeting with a lot of these R&D leaders. There is an enormous focus for our customers to go to larger packaging sizes so they can connect more GPUs, CPUs, and all these different computing components to improve performance and power an enormous amount. Applied is extremely well-positioned in HBM, and we are also well-positioned as these new technologies ramp for the future. I think high confidence in being able to double this business again over the next few years.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nThat is helpful detail.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nMaybe as a follow-up on the China entity with the $600 million that maybe comes back here, any help on what the split of that was for AGS in terms of services? I assume that would basically just kind of turn right back on, given you're able to service those customers.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah. You're right. There was some AGS in that. We didn't offer that, and I don't have it at my fingertips. So there was a component of AGS, but I think the majority was equipment.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director and Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shane Brett from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you for letting me ask a question. My first question is, you mentioned that your revenue from leading-edge DRAM customers is up 50% in fiscal 2025, which is stronger than those customers' DRAM WFE spending, to my knowledge.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nWhere specifically are these share gains of these leading-edge customers coming from? Now that you're past extremely tough China DRAM comps, just how do you expect your DRAM business to track in 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah. I'll start, Shane. When you do the year-over-year comparison, it looks flat for us from a DRAM perspective. What was happening in 2024, we shipped a significant amount of business to China customers. We basically had the same business in 2025 without the China customers. All of that business went to the internationals, and that equated to approximately a 50% growth for them. We do expect DRAM to strengthen as we go into 2026 and should be healthy growth across the customers for DRAM investments.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nYeah. Shane, just in terms of where are we gaining? Certainly, I mentioned earlier high-bandwidth memory.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nThat's one part, one segment where Applied is clear number one, and that is helping us. The DRAM companies are driving innovation in IO and Applied. That really leverages a lot of our leadership products and foundry logic. In fact, they're moving to FinFET going forward. That puts Applied in a good position even to gain more share as we go forward. We have a strong position in capacitor scaling. We have a really strong etch share in DRAM, and we've achieved patterning share gains. Those are a few areas. Again, I would say going forward, as these DRAM companies adopt hybrid bonding for HBM, as they adopt FinFET, as they adopt 4F-squared, the vertical channel transistor architecture, in all of those areas, we're positioned to gain share as those new technologies ramp.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Equity Research Analyst)\nThe second question may be a little bit critical, but your fiscal 2025 foundry logic revenue is up about 3% year-over-year. Your U.S. peers who should be on a level playing field with you are recording extremely strong double-digit growth through the first three quarters of the year. Just what's your self-assessment on this performance gap with those U.S. peers? How should we have confidence that Applied can outperform foundry logic WFE in 2026? Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nFoundry logic includes both leading-edge and ICAPS customers. Those two things are mixed together. If you look, we had record revenue in Taiwan, record revenue in Korea. Our performance is extremely strong. In the leading-edge, our revenue is up a significant amount. You have all those things kind of mixed together, I think, in that data because everybody's combining that.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Shane.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nOperator, we have time for one more question, please.\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our final question for today then comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nGood evening. Thanks for taking my question. Relative to the strength you're expecting in 2026 across leading-edge logic and DRAM, can you maybe guess which one might grow stronger than the other and which one might start to recover first?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nSure, Jim. We think leading-edge will be the strongest grower with DRAM second. That is our forecast.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nYeah. The one thing I would say, Jim, I think both of them are going to grow at a pretty strong rate. Really, in terms of when we see the revenue, it depends on fab timing. That is why we talked about kind of second half of calendar 2026.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (CEO)\nThose were the discussions I had with a lot of the Asian customers when I was traveling and the dramatic improvement in visibility. You have to take that into consideration when you think about the timing of when those ramps will happen.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Senior Equity Analyst)\nThank you. Maybe as a quick follow-up, growth margins are expecting to increase in the back half once you get better absorption on the costs. I understand that. Are there any other underlying initiatives you are doing to improve growth margins operationally that could cause kind of a further tailwind once we get there?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nSure. Thanks for the question. On the growth margin side, if you look at 2025, up 120 basis points from 2024, the majority of that really has been improvements in our pricing processes. Good change that we made.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe highlighted in previous calls that we revamped our entire pricing program across the company. We are also working on cost reductions. The cost reductions were offset to some degree by tariff headwinds and by some of the inventory management, etc. The real driver during the year was the price process improvements. Those will continue as we go into 2026. At the calendar second half, as we get more volume and you get some time for those to work, we should be able to improve the gross margins.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Jim. Thanks, Jim. Brice, would you like to sum up today's call?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThanks, Mike. I'm excited that the investments we're making in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and high-bandwidth memory give us technology leadership at the same time our customers are signaling an inflection in the AI-related fab equipment spending in the second half of calendar 2026.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI wish everyone a nice Thanksgiving, and I look forward to seeing many of you soon at the UBS conference in Scottsdale. Mike, please close the call.\n\n**Mike Sullivan** (Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations)\nAll right. Thank you. I would like to let everybody know that a replay of today's call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5:00 P.M. Pacific Time today. In the meantime, thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

      "content": "**Operator**\nWelcome to the Applied Materials Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. During the prepared remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Liz Morali, Vice President of Investor Relations. Liz, you may begin.\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for today's call. With me today are Gary Dickerson, President and CEO, and Brice Hill, CFO. Before we continue, let me remind you that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including predictions, estimates, projections, or other statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings with the SEC. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, we will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com.\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nI will now turn the call over to Gary.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Liz. In our third fiscal quarter of 2025, Applied Materials delivered record performance, fueled by strong, broad-based demand for semiconductor systems and services. However, as you will see in our guidance, we expect revenue and earnings to be sequentially lower in our fourth quarter, primarily due to uncertainties in our China business. Even with this Q4 forecast, we remain on track to achieve a mid-single-digit growth rate in fiscal 2025, which will be our sixth consecutive year of revenue growth. In my prepared remarks today, I'll give some additional color on our near-term outlook, provide an update on the longer-term secular industry growth drivers, and describe Applied's leadership position at the major device inflections that enable our customers' roadmaps. The dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment, including trade and tariffs, has wide-ranging implications for the semiconductor industry, increasing uncertainty and lowering visibility in the near term.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nFor Applied's business, there are three main factors that mute our outlook for the quarter ahead. First is digestion of capacity in China. Second is our large backlog of pending export license applications, where we have taken a conservative position and assumed none of these licenses will be issued in the next quarter. Third is nonlinear demand from leading-edge customers, which is primarily linked to market concentration and fab timing. None of these near-term considerations change our perspective on the longer-term opportunities for the industry and Applied Materials. Leadership in AI remains a major focus for both companies and countries, driving large investments in infrastructure and R&D. Governments around the world, especially the U.S. government, are taking major steps to incentivize companies to build advanced manufacturing capacity onshore. One example of this is Apple's American Manufacturing Program, which was announced last week.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nWe are excited to be a partner in this initiative that is designed to strengthen the end-to-end silicon supply chain in the U.S. As part of this endeavor, we plan to invest more than $200 million in Arizona to establish a state-of-the-art facility for manufacturing specialized components for our equipment. This builds on the more than $400 million we have invested in our U.S. manufacturing infrastructure over the past five years to provide the needed capacity and agility to support growing customer demand. Globally, we are now tracking more than 100 new fabs or major fab expansion projects, an increase of about 10% in the past year. In addition to robust supply chains, deploying AI at large scale requires significant innovation at every level of the technology stack, from models, software, and data center design to chip architectures and materials.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nAI's need for abundant, high-performance, and energy-efficient computing is reshaping the semiconductor roadmap and changing the way chips are designed and manufactured. This next wave of AI semiconductor innovation will be concentrated around five key areas: leading-edge logic, next-generation high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory or DRAM stacking, advanced packaging to connect logic and memory chips together, and innovations in power electronics to address energy consumption within the data center and more efficient grid-to-data center power delivery. In each of these critical areas, major device architecture inflections are shifting value towards material science and materials engineering, growing Applied Materials' addressable market, and driving closer collaboration with customers. On top of this, these inflections create opportunities for us to grow faster than the underlying market.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nBased on our deep customer engagements, we have focused our investments and product portfolio on the most enabling applications, and we expect healthy market share gains as these new technologies ramp in volume production. Let me walk you through some examples. In leading-edge foundry logic, the transition from FinFET to gate-all-around transistors with backside power delivery grows our revenue opportunity by 30% for the equivalent fab capacity, and we are on track to gain multiple points of market share when these nodes ramp in the second half of 2026 and 2027. In this past quarter, our strength in leading-edge foundry supported revenue of almost $1.2 billion for our metal deposition business, and we also secured our first wins in MOLE deposition for the most critical device performance applications.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nIn DRAM, we also have strong market share, and we expect our revenue from leading-edge DRAM customers to be up around 50% in fiscal 2025. In the quarter, our strength in DRAM supported record results for our edge business, which surpassed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. In addition, we see customers adopting our new solutions to address the stringent needs of high-performance compute memory. We have recently secured new volume production positions at leading DRAM manufacturers for our next-generation GAA-filled system, our most advanced chemical vapor deposition product, as well as our new Pioneer dielectric patterning system. Looking further ahead, when customers adopt vertical transistor or 4F2 architectures, a transition we expect starting in 2027 and 2028, we see opportunities to win more than five points of incremental DRAM share.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nIn advanced packaging, we have built a broad portfolio of solutions to enable both high-bandwidth memory and heterogeneous integration. We have high share in the packaging market, well above the company's overall wafer fab equipment share. We are well positioned for future architecture inflections, and our packaging business is on track to more than double to greater than $3 billion over the next few years. In power electronics, we believe the market for data center power semiconductors could grow to $9 billion by the end of the decade. We are on track to grow our share of this market with highly differentiated solutions that position us well for the future.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nAs our customers race to bring these complex device architecture inflections to market, we are providing advanced service solutions that support them all the way from technology transfer into their pilot lines to optimization of device performance, yield, and cost in volume production. On a year-over-year basis, our service business has now grown for 24 consecutive quarters. In addition, more than two-thirds of our service revenue comes from subscriptions, and we expect this percentage to further increase in the coming years. In the global race for AI leadership, having first access to new technologies has incredible value. To accelerate time-to-market for disruptive architectures in logic, memory, and packaging, we are changing the way we work with our customers and partners to increase the development and commercialization speed of next-generation technologies.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nThis high-velocity co-innovation strategy that we established with our leading customers is supported by Applied's global EPIC platform, which provides unique physical and digital infrastructure to accelerate AI chip architecture inflections and improve R&D spending efficiency. Our new flagship R&D facility, the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley, remains on track to begin operations in spring 2026. Before I hand it over to Brice, I'll briefly summarize. Applied Materials delivered record performance in our third fiscal quarter, and we remain on track for a sixth consecutive year of growth in fiscal 2025. We expect revenues and earnings to be sequentially lower in our fourth quarter, primarily due to uncertainties in our China business.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nOur long-term growth thesis for the semiconductor industry and Applied Materials remains unchanged as companies and countries compete to win the race for AI leadership, and Applied is best positioned at the major device inflections that enable the AI roadmap. These inflections will grow our total market opportunity and support market share gains in the years to come. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brice.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you, Gary, and thank you to everyone joining us for today's call. In fiscal Q3, we delivered a record quarter with growth across all three segments, and with a robust gross margin of nearly 49%, we also achieved record non-GAAP earnings per share. In semiconductor systems, the overall demand environment for equipment was largely in line with our expectations, with broad-based customer investments across foundry logic, DRAM, and NAND. In Applied Global Services, we achieved record core services revenue with positive trends across our key performance indicators. In display, we recorded our second consecutive quarter of revenue growth as the industry invests in equipment to support the further adoption of OLED technology in consumer devices. Let me now turn to the financial details for Q3. Total net revenue was approximately $7.3 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and about $100 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 48.9%, up 150 basis points year-over-year. The strong margin in Q3 was driven by the combination of product and segment mix and pricing as we worked to offset tariff-related headwinds. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.3 billion, down slightly as a percentage of revenue, as we optimized our G&A spending to help offset investments in R&D to support leading-edge technology inflections for our customers' roadmaps. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.48, up 17% year-over-year, given the revenue growth, better profitability, and share repurchases. Moving to the segments, semiconductor systems revenue was $5.43 billion for Q3, up 10% year-over-year, with growth in foundry logic driven by customer investments to support the ramp of gate-all-around nodes, partially offset by decreases in the ICAPS nodes, which we define as those greater than 7 nm.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nCompared to our expectations at our last earnings call, we saw slightly less than anticipated growth in leading-edge spending due to a slower fab build-out schedule and stronger than expected spending in ICAPS. DRAM was better than expected, up year-over-year, as customers focused on investments for AI-enabling advanced DRAM. We saw a significant increase in NAND, primarily driven by sales to multinational customers in China. Non-GAAP operating margin of 36.4% was up 140 basis points year-over-year. Moving to Applied Global Services, AGS delivered revenue of $1.6 billion in Q3, up 1% year-over-year, with growth in core services and a decline in 200 mm equipment sales. Core services grew approximately 10% year-over-year, bolstered by healthy utilization rates in leading-edge foundry logic and high-bandwidth memory, along with expansion of our tools under comprehensive agreements, which represent our most advanced service levels.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nNon-GAAP operating margin of 27.8% was down 180 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to customer mix. Lastly, our display business delivered revenue of $263 million, with non-GAAP operating margin of 23.6%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion, in debt of $6.3 billion, and generated our second highest level of cash from operations in company history at approximately $2.6 billion, or 36% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $584 million, including significant investments in the United States, driven by the build-out of Applied Materials Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization Center, or EPIC, which will be the largest and most advanced facility of its type globally. Free cash flow for Q3 was approximately $2 billion. We distributed approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders in the quarter, with dividends paid of $368 million and share repurchases of approximately $1 billion.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nAs of the end of the quarter, approximately $14.8 billion remains available to us on our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our outlook, as Gary mentioned, there are a couple of key factors contributing to our sequentially lower Q4 outlook. First, our customers in China are moderating spending following several periods of increased investments in equipment, and we expect China as a percentage of our revenue in Q4 to decrease to approximately 29%, including display. This assumes that we do not receive any approvals of our pending export license applications. Second, we expect demand from leading-edge customers to be down, given the nonlinear pattern that Gary talked about earlier, resulting from market concentration and fab timing. As a result, we are seeing customers take longer to commit to orders, leading to a shorter visibility window.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWith these shifts in mind for fiscal Q4, we expect total revenue of $6.7 billion, ±$500 million, representing a 4.9% decrease year-over-year at the midpoint, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.11, ±$0.20, representing a 9% decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect semiconductor systems revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, down approximately 9% year-over-year, and AGS revenue of approximately $1.6 billion, down 2% year-over-year, with growth in core services and a decline in sales of 200 mm equipment. In display, we expect revenue of approximately $350 million, a significant increase year-over-year, driven by the expansion of OLED screens in consumer devices. This does not yet include revenue from our new Max OLED system, which we announced last year, and which represents a dramatically different manufacturing approach to mass-producing superior OLED displays.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nLastly, given the lower expected build volumes and our projected business mix in Q4, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 48.1% and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $1.31 billion, and we are modeling a tax rate of 12.6%. In closing, we are leveraging our robust supply chain, global manufacturing footprint, leading technology, and deep customer relationships to navigate and adapt to the near-term uncertainties. Our long-term growth thesis remains intact, and we remain laser-focused on positioning our investments and portfolio to focus on the most enabling and critical applications for our customers. Thank you for listening, and we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. Liz?\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have an additional question, please re-queue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star one one on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star one one again. Our first question for today comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\n\n**Jim Schneider** (Analyst)\nYes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk to the incremental sources of weakness in the outlook. Specifically, in China, do you see the decrease in visibility there being extended well into 2026, or do you think that is more of a short-term thing? Secondly, on the leading-edge logic weakness, do you have any sense of what you expect that to cover in the next couple of quarters, or is that simultaneously lower visibility into next year? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHello, Jim. Thanks for the question. On the outlook, two factors, as you suggest. One is the lower China, and we've foreshadowed this over the last year. We had very large shipments into China in 2023 and 2024, and we expected, you know, lower business in 2025. We actually expect this to continue for several more quarters as we look forward. It's hard to give a specific guide. As you know, those numbers have changed over time. With such a large build in China in those 2023 and 2024, we call it digestion. It's not unexpected that we would have, you know, lower business, especially given the restrictions in our Q4 guide, much like we experienced in Q2, if you recall. Turning to leading logic, here, this was different than our expectations. We have underlying demand that we think is very strong. You've got 100% utilization on the leading edge.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYou've got reportedly more design wins. You've got CapEx going up at cloud service providers. You've got a lot of pull from AI-related technologies, especially on the leading edge in DRAM, in HBM also. We expected and modeled a relatively linear ramp that would accelerate through 2025 and into 2026. We're not seeing that in the order pattern for Q4. At this point, it's just uneven. We attribute, you know, some companies have been waiting longer to make capital commits in this environment that we're all going through with tariff and trade and other uncertainties. Also, with the concentration on leading edge customer concentration, it's a little bit harder to achieve an even ramp. In past years, you have multiple customers to try to achieve a level load in your factories. Now, with one customer being larger than the other customers, it's more attached to their ramp and their loadings.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThat's a factor in the unevenness of the ramp going forward. I'll just say that we're not changing our expectations. We expect gate-all-around nodes to be very large. We think it'll grow to be more than 300,000 wafer starts of capacity per month as that ramps. It's just going to be a little bit uneven going forward. As far as our visibility into following quarters, we're working on that. I think investors should know we always have high confidence in the quarter that we guide. In the out quarters, they're typically not completely scheduled. We're working on that for the out quarters, and that's one of the reasons why we don't guide the out quarter. I'll have to take a rain check on answering exactly when we'll know the shape of the ramp, but we're confident that we'll ramp on leading edge going forward.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. China's 35% of the revenue in the current quarter. I didn't get the impression the last quarter that you expected China to be that strong. I think it was 25% the quarter before. I guess the question is, was China significantly stronger than you expected? If that's the case, it feels like the non-China business feels weaker than you were sort of alluding to in your comments, just because the overall numbers weren't that far off of where you had guided. Can you give me a little more color on what your expectations had been for China relative to where it came in the quarter relative to the rest of the business?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, absolutely. Thanks, Stacy. I think the quarter played out just pretty much exactly as we expected, the mix across. I don't know if we gave the 35% number exactly or not, but it's certainly.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nYou did not.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI think we indicated that it was growing. From our expectation, you don't know until the end what the percentage will be, but we expected it to be higher. No real change in the flow from that perspective during the quarter. The only thing that I highlighted in the script was there was a little bit less activity on leading edge in the quarter, which we highlighted. We had said that we expected acceleration through the year. We expected nearly $5 billion of gate-all-around related purchases in 2025, and now we're seeing that be lower, probably just over $4.5 billion. 80% growth instead of 100% growth. Those are really the dynamics. The change for us, even in our outlook, we expected China to be lower in Q4. The change for us is just the linearity of the leading edge.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nGot it. I mean, if I dig into that a little bit, if you're guiding China to like 29% of revenue versus 35%, that's, I don't know, it's a $600 million decline. Display is $100 million, give or take, stronger. It's something like a $500 million decline in China equipment. The total equipment guide is down $700 million+. That incremental $200 million or $250 million, is that like the lower leading edge? Is it all in? It's all in like the foundry logic leading edge. How do I think about the components of that guide?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nI think you got your equation right. Approximately $500 million China, approximately $500 million leading edge, which I alluded to with the $4.5 billion instead of $5 billion. There are some upsides in rest of world ICAPS that explain the difference that you're looking for.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nDo you think the non-China leading edge is down another $500 million sequentially? That's what you're saying? Or was that an annual number?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nReconciling the down of $700 million, I would say it's $500 million China, $500 million leading edge, and then a plus factor for rest of world ICAPS.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nOkay, where's that coming from, though?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe're not going to be specific. It would be too indicative of a particular customer, but it's not China.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nOkay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Senior Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. Gary, the question is for you. Both kind of near and medium term. If you look at Q1, if these trends persist, should we be assuming any sequential growth into Q1, right, based on what we know? I know you only guide one quarter at a time. If I kind of zoom out, same question for fiscal 2026, that if China may not grow, and if your one kind of leading-edge customer in the U.S. is going through its issues, do you think memory growth is enough, DRAM growth is enough for Applied Materials to grow overall as a company? If you could just give us the contours of how you are thinking about Q1 and fiscal 2026, even if it is not in terms of absolute dollars. Just the shape and direction, I think, would be extremely helpful to investors on this call.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Senior Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nVivek, I'll probably start on the guide for Q1. As I highlighted earlier, we're sharing that there's more uncertainty and a little bit lower visibility in the current environment. Customers are later in making their commits, and we're definitely not able yet to give any specific color for our Q1. Having said that, as you're sort of alluding to, the trends underneath for strong DRAM and strong leading logic, we think are continuing. We're just going to have to wait for more time to go by to understand the linearity of demand, specifically on the leading edge. On DRAM, we'll either have a record or we'll almost have a record this year. What that is, is you recall the prior year, there was a couple of quarters of shipments to China customers.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYou don't have that this year, so you've got the leading-edge memory players all growing nearly 50%, as Gary said in his script. DRAM is very strong. Leading logic, I sort of clicked off all the factors that we look at. It's a great process for gate-all-around. It's got significant performance advantages. It's got design momentum. You have 100% utilization on leading-edge processes. You've got cloud CapEx going up from cloud CapEx or the cloud service providers. Just a lot of momentum in that space. We think that's plenty of pull on the leading edge, and we're just going to have to work on the linearity as this build-out occurs over the next couple of years. On your specific question, will memory growth be strong enough and will leading edge be strong enough to offset a China year that will be lower than 2024?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe don't know exactly what it'll be, but it'll be lower than 2024. That's going to be the question. It was much like 2025. We said if we have growth, which we have, it would be a strength of leading edge and DRAM that offset any slowness in China. That's going to be the same question for 2026, and we're just going to have to see how it works forward.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I was hoping to probe the different areas of weakness that you cited for October. For the first part with China, it sounds like for many of your peers that the concentration is just six large players who don't require licenses. I'm curious why your shipments could be so robust through July, but now in October, licenses are now the challenge. From a foundry perspective, can you be more specific? Is that just timing of clean room space availability? What's causing the lack of kind of visibility there, particularly given that utilization, like you cited, is running 100%? On the HBM side, can you clarify what you're seeing there? Is that a function of waiting on contract pricing for 2026 before signing for tools or something else? Thanks so much.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nOkay, CJ, thank you. First on China, as I said earlier, I think China played out as expected. Good question on why there is more business in Q3 than Q4. I think just the customers, there may have been some strategic placement of having more deliveries in Q3. There were certainly different uncertainties resolving at different speeds as we went through the first half of the year. I think the delivery schedule for us, or the way it played out on the business side, was pretty much as expected. I would say Q4 is just back to the level that we have been expecting all year long, just something lower than what we saw in 2024. As I alluded to, we expect that to last a little bit longer, several quarters longer, where the business will be less than 2024.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nJust so investors understand, there are new fabs, there is lots of new investment in China. It is just not quite at that 2024 rate. When we shift to leading logic, of course, we model all of the factories of our customers, the amount of capacity they are putting in, the applications that we have. I will just say that our model had a more linear assumption than reality. No significant changes to point to in customer availability. I think there were some, but it is nothing like that. It is just that we assumed a more linear ramp, and we are not seeing that. We will work with the customers on that as we look at the coming quarters. On the contract, yeah, go ahead.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nCan I just clarify, in China, you talked about waiting on licenses. Could you speak to that?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, we do have a backlog of licenses, and we're just highlighting. We did not include any revenue in our outlook from that backlog. It's been growing over the past quarters, and it's getting to be a significant backlog in terms of the number of licenses. I know the government is aware of that, but we're just being conservative and not including any of that in the outlook. Back to just to be clear, the customers we're serving and the outlook that we have, we are not waiting on licenses for that outlook. We're comfortable with what we've guided, and there's no contingency there.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Weathers from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (Analyst)\nHi there. I also wanted to ask on the leading edge, but more specifically on the second-tier players. There's obviously a higher degree of uncertainty around their CapEx outlooks for like the Intels and Samsungs of the world. Can you help us understand what are you baking into your own planning and what assumptions are you making on what their spending outlook, where their spending outlook could shake out as it relates to your own outlook?\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nYeah, thanks, Melissa. When we take this question, you know, we don't talk about specific customers, but when we take this question, what we do highlight is we're up to date with our customers and their forecasts. We typically update, you know, the medium-term forecasts with our customers twice a quarter, and that'll be the case for those customers. We highlighted that we do have more concentration in our demand on leading edge than we've experienced before. That's probably the best we can say, but I think, you know, we definitely understand where they are in their plans today.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Advanced packaging, a lot of good stuff happening there. It was a $1.7 billion business for the team last fiscal year. I think it's grown at about a 35%, 40% CAGR over the prior four years. Lots of inflections, right? HBM3 to HBM4, 2.5D to 3.5D packaging. Can the team just true us up? Like what type of growth are you expecting this fiscal year in advanced packaging? Is this segment also being impacted by the weaker advanced logic spending dynamics that you're seeing in the second half?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThanks, Harlan. I'll start, and I think Gary will add on here. On the advanced packaging, we're seeing about a steady pace relative to last year, minus the burst capacity, you know, initial burst capacity we saw in HBM at the end of last year. I'd say, you know, similar to last year from a pacing perspective for that business. We don't see any change related to the leading edge schedules and the purchasing behaviors there. Gary, on the positioning.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nYeah, Harlan, packaging is really the highest market share area for Applied Materials. We have a broad portfolio. We're the largest supplier of all the materials innovation inside packaging. We have a unique integrated packaging R&D center in Singapore, where we have a lot of our leading customers co-innovating with us on next-generation architectures. We have a strong pipeline of new capabilities coming, including an integrated hybrid bonding system and other technologies that will further strengthen our market share in packaging. What I talked about earlier on the call is that we're on track to more than double this business going forward to more than $3 billion per year. I would say that for me personally, again, if AI, energy-efficient computing, this is really one of four areas that are really important for power and performance. I'm personally spending a tremendous amount of time with our customers.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nWe're also working with customers in the ecosystem on new architectures that I think are going to have a big impact on energy efficiency, but also create further opportunities for Applied Materials. We have high visibility into this segment of our business. This is the highest share, well-positioned, and again, on track to more than double this to more than $3 billion in the next few years.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nThanks, Gary. Thanks, Brice.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowan. Your question, please.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Analyst)\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I had a question for Brice, and sorry for harping on China things. A clarification on the question. The first one on the clarification, your April quarter China revenues were $1.8 billion and July was $2.6 billion. Did the Liberation Day in the month of April push some of your China sales from April into the July quarter? On the question on October quarter weakness, you said China is $500 million. How much is the licensing amount you backed out of that? If that comes through, how to think about the revenue upside in October from getting the licenses and any implications on gross margin?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nOkay, thanks, Krish, for the question. On the first one, you're definitely remembering the dynamics correctly. There was a lot of uncertainty towards the end of our Q2, as I think some of the trade and tariff uncertainties were resolved towards the end of our quarter. We were scrambling to ship what we had planned on shipping. As I articulated last time, we pretty much made the quarter exactly as we expected, even though there was a lot of uncertainty in the last few weeks of that quarter. As we think about the higher number in our Q3 results here for China, I don't think it was a push from Q2. That's not the dynamic. It was just more business, and I assume there's reasons at each customer for making that quarter larger.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI would also say that the Q2 and Q4 are more indicative of the level of business we've been expecting this year, given some digestion in China. On the licensing, I wouldn't look for upsides to our outlook quarter. I think even if that situation changes, it'll take time to plan and build equipment or turn on services. I don't think there's any immediate upside that anyone should expect from that. We're just highlighting that it is affecting the trajectory of the business, which is unfortunate.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Analyst)\nIs that a way to quantify that licensing amount dollars, or no?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nNo, we're not going to offer that, but it is a large number of licenses.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Analyst)\nThanks, Bryce.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Your question, please.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Analyst)\nI noticed that you actually optimized your leading-edge DRAM growth for the current fiscal year from 40%—which was what you said last quarter—to 50%. The fiscal Q3 DRAM number, you said this is slightly better than you expected. That was down, right, sequentially. That kind of implies October quarter, it may bounce back a little bit. My question is, is that really just a temporary pop, given all the things you talked about, timing, uncertainties among your leading customers, or maybe there's still more of a durability into the early part of fiscal 2026 for the leading-edge DRAM? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYes, thanks for the question, Charles. I certainly don't want to draw the conclusion that there's any pop or some unusual increment there. We view DRAM as very strong. We view what's happening in DRAM to be sustainable from a trend perspective without making a specific guide. Like we said, it should be either a record year or a second best year this year. It's really those leading edge customers growing. I think our investors know, underneath what's happening for DRAM is you have HBM growing at 30%-40%, depending on which report you look at. About 15% of DRAM capacity is allocated towards HBM. There's a trade-off, as you know, between making high-bandwidth memory and not in terms of the amount of silicon required. There's a significant demand pull in DRAM. Our forward-looking outlook and our perspective is that it's not a blip. Thanks for the question.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Analyst)\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Just to be clear then, I guess relative to that commentary or clarification around leading-edge DRAM spending, that timing or fab timing and sort of dislinearity sort of impact the next quarter's, the October quarter revenue, that's really mainly focused in advanced foundry, it sounds like. More broadly, I also heard something about thinking that at full scale, gate-all-around could be something like $300,000 wafer per month. Are we exiting this year maybe something like around 10% or a little bit higher than that? Basically suggesting that we have a pretty long runway there in terms of that expansion.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nBrian, thanks for the question. You're right. Our comments on concentration are directed towards leading logic, not DRAM. I'm sure there's some of the same factor in DRAM, but in terms of the nonlinearity of builds and the things that we're working on, that's directed towards a foundry comment, leading logic comment. We just went through DRAM. We think that's strong. It continues to be strong. On the gate-all-around nodes, based on our numbers of $4.5 billion and what we shipped last year, $2.5 billion, we'd estimate close to 100,000 wafer starts of capacity are in the field or will be in the field as we close the quarter. You're in the first three innings of the build-out there from a gate-all-around, at least the initial node, and then, of course, there'll be subsequent nodes.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nYes, thank you. Good afternoon. I guess a two-part question on China. One is how significant was the multinationals in China? That was kind of like a source of strength last quarter. Was that very significant? Going forward, you've given China as a percentage of revenue on what you thought in the past, and that's something you talked about for Q2. I guess what I'm hearing now is that the Q2, Q4 China revenue numbers, we should kind of stay at those levels over the next couple of quarters, and it sounds like that happens regardless of whether or not you get incremental licenses. Is that the correct interpretation?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYes, Chris, thanks for the question. On the multinationals, we did have revenue from that in our Q3, and it was noticeable. We wouldn't share the exact number, but it was noticeable and definitely part of our revenues in the quarter. There is a little bit in Q4, although, you know, very small in Q4. On the second piece, sorry, can you repeat the second piece? I can't read my own writing.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nIt's okay. You had given in the past, you know, your expectations.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nOh, the Q2, Q4.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nAs a percentage of revenue, is it sort of Q2, Q4 levels? We'll just take that and assume that's flat in the next couple of quarters, regardless of whether or not you get incremental licenses?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI think in that range. We were okay to share that, you know, with our guide, we're probably 15% to 20% down for China relative to 2024. That's probably the right level to think about for the next few quarters.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timm Schulze-Melander from Redburn Atlantic. Your question, please.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Analyst)\nYeah, hi there. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to build on the question or the response to Jim Schneider's question. You talked about in China, you have the visibility that lets you kind of guide for a pretty stable reset to revenues for the next few quarters. I just want to come back to the logic foundry, sort of leading edge part of your business. You talked about how you update with customers kind of a couple of times a quarter. Just as you see this now, is it that a visibility for the next few quarters isn't possible or the spread is too wide? I just wanted to understand why we have kind of a reasonable shop here in China and maybe why that doesn't exist in logic foundry leading edge. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYes, thanks, Tim. I definitely wouldn't want to create the perspective that we have more visibility in China than we do in the other end markets. That's not the case. What's shading our comments on China is just our expectation that it can't run at the same rate in the short term that we saw in 2024. We know there was a lot of incentives to make the level of investment in 2024. We've been expecting it to be lower than 2024 until utilizations across all those factories become higher. That's more of intuition matched by, of course, what we're hearing from the customers and the accounts. On the leading edge, it's a good question. What we're doing is just realizing that we had a lot of effort during COVID put into building good visibility with our customers into multi-year demand and multi-year build plans.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nIn this uncertain environment, what we're saying is we've kind of fallen off that. Customers have been less certain, and that added visibility that we had put in place just isn't there right now. We do have a good perspective of factories and capacity that's being put in place. It comes down to the actual build order and linearity, and that's what we're working on.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Analyst)\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYep.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shane Brett from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Analyst)\nThank you for taking my question. Sorry for harping on the leading-edge logic place here, but on that $4.5 billion of GA revenue, how would you characterize your share position kind of one year into this GA ramp? Is this tracked in line with expectations, or are there things that haven't gone as planned? I'm asking this because just $500 million is not nothing. It's a bit of a step down from the $5 billion that you earlier mentioned. I just want to get assurance that this isn't a share issue. Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nHi, Shane. Thanks for the question. We have very high visibility on the architecture inflections for our leading-edge logic customers. The big inflections that are really crucial for AI energy-efficient computing are gate-all-around and backside power distribution. As we've talked about before, and as I talked about earlier on the call, we expect revenue for Applied Materials to increase about 30% on the same number of wafer starts as those two nodes ramp over the next couple of years. Applied Materials is in an extremely strong position with all of those leading-edge logic customers. I would say that our engagements with customers are earlier, deeper, and broader than they've ever been. When you think about gate-all-around or backside power in the transistor and the wiring, those are areas where Applied Materials has tremendously enabling technologies. Those are also inflections where there's significant demand for our integrated systems.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nWhen you're thinking about these chips, they're over 2,000 steps. Some of those materials are a few atoms thick, and those interfaces are really difficult and have a big impact on the overall electrical performance. What we're seeing is an increased adoption of integrated systems, the number of steps, the number of technologies you're integrating into a single platform. I would say that very high visibility, very high confidence that we are outperforming as gate-all-around is ramping first generation, next generation, and also we're positioned to outperform on backside power. These are essential for our customers for their design wins, for their key AI customers, and super high confidence that we are gaining share and position for significant revenue growth going forward.\n\n**Shane Brett** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Analyst)\nYeah, hi. Just to get in, just to follow up on the previous question, in terms of the ramps, given your more than 50% share on Gate-All-Around and backside power, when do you see that start to get more material? If you can give us some more color there.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, I think thanks for the question, Vijay. We won't get specific. We do expect it to ramp. We did expect it in the prior quarter that we would see continued acceleration. We can't, right now, we're going to have to work on what the loading plan is for the next couple of quarters. I think we'll just have to wait for more visibility as we work with the customers across. Generally, we do expect investment to increase. When we think across the long term, we have leading edge logic and DRAM as the two fastest growing end markets. We think we have double exposure to the two fastest end markets with both being exposed to the markets themselves and having technologies that will allow us to gain share. That's the strategy that we're putting in place and we have for the company.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe'll just have to wait as we work with the customers on the next couple of quarters.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Analyst)\nGot it. Quickly on the OpEx side, Brice, with the revenues being a little challenged there, any thoughts on where OpEx should trend? I think it's like 16% is your long-term target. Where do you see that trending on OpEx?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, thanks for the question. We've been closer to 18% for some time. I think 16% was an aged number, probably from the model of years ago. To your point, given the revenue guide, we'll be very cautious on spending as we go through the next quarter, and you should see us behave that way.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Analyst)\nThanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment on the ICAPS business. I understand the weakness in China, but as non-China ICAPS, have you started to see that business stabilize, or should we think about both China and non-China being a continuing headwind for growth in the coming quarters?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThanks for the question, Joe. We do still see lower utilizations across the ICAPS. Having said that, and ICAPS being our mature nodes, IoT, communications, auto, power, and sensors for investors listening, where that acronym is new. What we've said for several quarters is with utilizations low and some of the end markets slower, the investment levels would still be muted. We did see some green shoots in the quarter. We saw some pickup on the industrial side. As I highlighted, we do see rest of world investments this quarter in ICAPS picking up. I think this one will just be a space to watch. Over time, we do expect the ICAPS market to grow. It's just a question of how much digestion we have in China for the overall market going forward. Thanks for the question.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Brice Hill for any further remarks.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you. Thank you, everybody, for attending today. In summary, during this period of lower visibility, we're leveraging our global supply chain and manufacturing footprint to stay flexible and adapt to a dynamic range of scenarios. As I've highlighted in the past, we understand that quarterly growth may be uneven at times, but that doesn't deter us from our strategy to focus on the highest growth areas of the market, which are directly enabling secular trends like AI. Thank you. Liz, please close the call.\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Brice. I'd like to call your attention to some upcoming investor events. On August 28, Brice will attend the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference, and on September 9, Gary will attend the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference. A replay of today's call will be available on the Investor Relations website by 5:00 P.M. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Afterwards, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Liz Morali, Vice President of Investor Relations. Liz, you may begin.\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for today's call. With me today are Gary Dickerson, President and CEO, and Brice Hill, CFO. Before we continue, let me remind you that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including predictions, estimates, projections, or other statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings with the SEC. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, we will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com.\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nI will now turn the call over to Gary.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nThanks, Liz. In our second fiscal quarter of 2025, Applied Materials delivered strong results across the board, including record earnings per share. These results reflect great execution by our teams around the world, as well as the agility and flexibility we have in our global operations and supply chain. While we are paying close attention to a highly dynamic macro environment, we have not seen significant changes in market demand. Our customers remain focused on winning the race to be first to market with transformative new technologies. Applied is working closely with our customers and partners to accelerate the industry's roadmap. We are very well positioned at major technology inflections in fast-growing areas of the market, which supports our multi-year growth trajectory. In my prepared remarks today, I'll provide our latest market outlook.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nI'll explain how Applied's innovative products and services are enabling fundamental advances in semiconductor technology, and I'll describe how we are translating these innovations into sustainable, profitable growth across our business. Starting with our perspective on the market, the major technology trends reshaping the global economy, including IoT, automation and robotics, electric and autonomous vehicles, and clean energy, are all built on top of advanced semiconductors. Central to our future market outlook is AI, which is the most transformative technology of our lifetimes and has almost limitless potential use cases. While we are seeing remarkable progress in AI capabilities, we are still in the early phases of a multi-decade build-out of applications and infrastructure. Large-scale deployment of AI will require major advances in computing performance and energy efficiency that can only be achieved through disruptive innovation across the technology stack.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nThese requirements are reshaping the semiconductor roadmap and changing the way chips are designed and manufactured. The impact of AI data center innovation and investments is apparent in the wafer fab equipment market, where there are significant shifts in the spending mix this year. We see investment in leading-edge foundry logic growing substantially in 2025, and we also expect spending for leading-edge DRAM to be up significantly. We see lower spending in China, with investments in both DRAM and mature logic down for the year. We are seeing an uptick in NAND investment, albeit from the very low levels seen over the past several years. Against this market backdrop, Applied is well positioned for 2025 and beyond. In 2024, we underperformed the market in China due to the market access restrictions imposed on U.S. companies.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nAt the same time, outside of China, we grew faster than our peer group, thanks to our strength in leading-edge foundry and DRAM. Trade restrictions have also had an impact on our service business. Despite these headwinds, we grew our core parts and services revenues in the low double-digit range last year and were on track to deliver a similar growth rate in 2025. On top of our growing installed base, we are successfully increasing the portion of those systems in the field covered by higher-value advanced services and comprehensive service agreements. More than two-thirds of our service revenue comes from subscriptions, and we expect this percentage to further increase in the coming years. At a company level, through 2024, Applied Materials has grown revenues for five consecutive years. This momentum continues in 2025.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nIf we take our first half results plus our third quarter guide, revenues are up 7% year to date. Looking further ahead, we also believe we're in a great position for the future, given the direction of the industry roadmap, our strong leadership positions at key device architecture inflections, and the unique portfolio of solutions and capabilities we provide to our customers. Customers are racing to be first to market to deliver major architecture innovations in logic, compute memory, packaging, and power devices, including next-generation gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery, 4F² and 3D DRAM, advanced packaging, compound semiconductors for power electronics, and silicon photonics. These technology inflections grow the market for wafer fab equipment, increase the relative mix of materials engineering technologies, and provide opportunities for Applied to gain market share. Advanced foundry logic is a great example of this.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nIf we compare an advanced fab using integrated gate-all-around and backside power delivery architecture to the last generation of FinFET technology, Applied's revenue opportunity is approximately 30% higher for the equivalent fab capacity. In advanced DRAM, we're focused on addressing the most critical steps for next-generation technologies, and this has enabled us to establish a strong leadership position in this market. In 2025, we expect our revenues from advanced DRAM customers to grow more than 40% as they ramp investments in DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory. Across advanced foundry logic and DRAM, we are introducing innovative new solutions that are being rapidly adopted by the market. One example is our SIM 3 Magnum Etch system for advanced patterning, which has generated more than $1.2 billion of revenue since we launched the product in February 2024.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nAnother example is our breakthrough cold field emission e-beam technology that has strong momentum in gate-all-around and high-bandwidth memory and supported record revenues for our process diagnostic and control business this past quarter. As we look at how the industry's roadmap is evolving, we see our broad capabilities and connected product portfolio as a major leadership strength. This gives us earlier visibility and a more holistic view of the industry's most valuable technical opportunities. It allows us to develop solutions to address those high-value opportunities faster, and most importantly, it means we can deliver unique solutions by co-optimizing and combining our innovations. With the pace of technology accelerating, being first to market has incredible value for our customers and Applied Materials. For this reason, another key pillar of our strategy is high-velocity co-innovation.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nOur goal is to increase the speed of developing and commercializing next-generation technologies through earlier and deeper collaboration with customers and partners. Applied's global EPIC platform is designed to support this strategy by providing unique physical and digital infrastructure to accelerate learning rates and optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of R&D resources. Construction of our new flagship R&D facility, the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley, is progressing on schedule, and we expect the center to start operations in spring 2026. Before I hand over to Bryce, I'll quickly summarize. First, while we recognize that the macro environment is highly dynamic, Applied continues to deliver strong financial performance. We are not currently seeing significant changes in customer demand, and we have agility in our global operations to adapt to a range of scenarios. Second, the race to deliver high-performance, energy-efficient AI computing remains the dominant driver of the semiconductor industry's roadmap.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nApplied is best positioned as a major device architecture inflection that will enable that roadmap to be realized. Third, we are seeing strong traction with our high-velocity co-innovation strategy, where earlier and deeper collaboration with our customers and partners is enabling us to bring next-generation technology to market faster than ever before. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brice.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThanks, Gary, and thank you to everyone joining us for today's call. We delivered another strong quarter in fiscal Q2 with robust year-over-year revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and record earnings per share. These excellent results were driven by increased leading-edge foundry logic investments, given the strong end-market demand for AI-enabling semiconductors. This performance was achieved within the rapidly evolving economic and trade policy environment of the past several months, and we leveraged our global supply chain and diversified manufacturing footprint to successfully navigate the dynamic commercial landscape. With strong profitability and record earnings per share, we increased shareholder capital distributions during Q2 with approximately $2 billion in dividends and share repurchases and bought back approximately 1.4% of shares outstanding.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nTurning to the details for Q2, our results were largely in line with our expectations, with total net revenue of approximately $7.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with growth across all our business segments. Non-GAAP gross margin was 49.2%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and our highest quarterly gross margin since fiscal year 2000. The strong margin performance in Q2 was primarily driven by a favorable mix of our products and business segments. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.3 billion, down slightly as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis, with growth in R&D partially offset by decreases in G&A as we focused on funding critical technology inflection-related research. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.39, up 14% year-over-year, given the revenue growth, better profitability, and share repurchases.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nMoving to the segments, semiconductor systems revenue was $5.26 billion for Q2, up 7% year-over-year, with growth in foundry logic as customer investments at the leading edge more than offset declines for the ICAPS nodes that serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power, and sensor markets, and growth in NAND upgrades more than offsetting year-over-year declines in DRAM. Non-GAAP operating margin of 36.4% was up 150 basis points year-over-year. Moving to Applied Global Services, AGS delivered revenue of $1.57 billion in Q2, up 2% year-over-year, as healthy growth in services more than offset the expected decline in sales of 200-millimeter equipment. Non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5% was flat year-over-year. Lastly, our display business delivered revenue of $259 million, with Non-GAAP operating margin of 26.3%.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.2 billion and debt of $6.3 billion, and cash from operations in the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, or 22% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $510 million, up from the year-ago period, and driven by the build-out of Applied Materials Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization Center, EPIC, the largest and most advanced facility of its type globally. Free cash flow for Q2 was approximately $1.1 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we increased capital allocation in Q2, with total shareholder distributions of approximately $2 billion, with dividends paid of $325 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.7 billion. As previously announced, during the quarter, our board of directors approved a 15% increase to our dividend per share.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThis marks another year of healthy growth for our dividend, one of our key capital allocation priorities, and as I like to point out, the dividend and its growth are closely correlated with the recurring revenue and profits in our services business. We also announced that our board approved an additional $10 billion share repurchase authorization, and as of the end of the quarter, approximately $15.9 billion in total remains available to us for future share repurchases. Turning to our outlook, as we contemplate the year-over-year performance we expect in Q3, we are seeing acceleration from our leading-edge foundry logic products, which are key enablers in the ongoing gate-all-around build-out and which will more than offset a lower level of investment in the ICAPS nodes following two years of strong spending by these customers. We also expect a stable and healthy DRAM market and growth in NAND driven by upgrades.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nFactoring in these views for fiscal Q3, we expect total revenue of $7.2 billion, plus or minus $500 million, representing a 6% increase year-over-year at the midpoint, and a non-GAAP EPS of $2.35, plus or minus $0.20, representing an 11% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect semiconductor system revenues of approximately $5.4 billion, up approximately 10% year-over-year, and AGS revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, down 2% year-over-year, with growth in core services impacted by the trade restrictions previously disclosed and declines in demand for 200-millimeter equipment. Rounding out the business segments, we expect display revenue of approximately $250 million. Lastly, given our business mix in Q3, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 48.3% and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $1.3 billion, and we are modeling a tax rate of approximately 13%.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nIn closing, while the trade environment continues to evolve, our global supply chain and diversified manufacturing capabilities provide us with significant agility and flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In the near term, we see overall demand and customer investments continuing at the expected rate and pace, even in the current environment, and the long-term secular drivers for growth in our business remain intact. We are positioning ourselves to benefit from the opportunities that will emerge as the equipment industry invests to support a $1 trillion-plus semiconductor market by the end of the decade, and we are investing for the growth that we expect in our business over that time. Thank you, and we're now ready to begin the Q&A. Liz?\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have an additional question, please re-queue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question at this time, please press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig into services in China. Last quarter, you had talked about the incremental hit from the China restrictions across equipment and services, and we saw the hit particularly on the AGS segment. You had said that you would return to sequential growth in Q3, but this is not sequential growth. This is kind of flattish to maybe even down a little bit sequentially. I guess what is going on there? Is that just a bigger hit than expected on 200-millimeter, or is China worse? How should we be thinking about growth for this business into the end of the year? Do you think it resumes sequential growth in Q4?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHi, Stacy. Thanks for the question. On the AGS, you've got a lot of those elements correct. What we would say is the core business in Q2 had a record, and we expect the core to grow at low double digits during the year, just like you would expect for that part of the business, even with the impacts we've seen from lower China business due to those trade restrictions. In the quarter, our Q2 and Q3, that's where you have the effects of some of those accounts becoming restricted. The year-over-year growth, we just made year-over-year growth for the quarter on AGS, and you're right. It's really the 200-millimeter equipment that slows down significantly during that quarter that makes that look weaker from a performance perspective.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI think the key things that we want our investors to think about is AGS will grow at low double digits going forward as we digest these trade rules. With our Q3 guidance, you can see that it is marginal quarter-over-quarter in total, where we will have the full effect of all of those rules, but the core will be growing year-over-year, and we will see that low double-digit growth for the core for the full year. Going forward after Q3, you should expect to see the sequential type of growth that you would expect to deliver that low double-digit going forward. I would just point out, just for investors to remember that, yes, we do connect our dividend to the recurring profits for that business, and it is largely a recurring revenue business.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nAbout 90% at this point is recurring revenue with high renewals of multi-year contracts, and about 66% of the business is under those subscription agreements. Pretty strong from a recurring revenue and profit perspective. Thanks for the question.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nIt does seem like the 200-millimeters weaker than you thought. Is that correct?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah. I think that's one factor. It might be a little bit less than we thought. The second is we expected a little bit more in utilization for the quarter, and utilization stayed about flat for the quarter. The spare side of the business was also probably not right up to what we expected.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Stacy, on 200-millimeter, a lot of that business is tied to power electronics, and long term, we think that's going to be mid to high single-digit growth. In the near term, that business is down from where it was at previously. Again, that's one of the things that's causing that business to be weaker in the near term. In service, we're driving a lot of service innovation. We have 8,000 tools connected in the field, and I think high confidence that will grow at low double-digit going forward.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nThanks for taking my question. If I contrast the sales growth you have versus peers, right, many of them are expecting to grow double-digit. You guys are more consistent at this 7% or so growth rate, and the perception is your higher ICAPS exposure. Could you help us size what ICAPS is now as a percentage of sales? Do you think it has bottomed? Can it continue to be a headwind? If you could give us some trends on China versus non-China ICAPS demand for the rest of the year. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHi, Vivek. Thanks for the question. I guess I would start mature logic ICAPS with the ICAPS end markets, IoT, communications, auto, power, sensors for us. First thing we would say is we expect mid- to high single-digit growth across the horizon heading to that $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion market by 2030 from a semi perspective. When you look inside our business, we're expecting right now, if you look at semis and AGS, we would say mid-20% will be about the share of the China business for us, if that gives you a perspective there. When we think about China specifically, we're restricted from competing in some accounts, but for the accounts that we're able to sell to, we think we're performing very well from a share perspective. We expect those markets to grow.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe see that market investing more and more in 28-nanometer going forward. They kind of built out the 50-plus-nanometer capacities, now focusing on 28-nanometer, and we feel like we're very well positioned on 28-nanometer. We've got the world-leading foundry positions in that node. We're confident that that 25% for the business is probably a good number to think of without display, and that should grow over time looking forward.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Vivek, maybe just to clarify, the mid-20s as a % of our total company revenue is China semi, including equipment and service. That is kind of that number. I am sure you know and other people on the call know we have a display business that adds a few % to overall Applied revenue. What I would add, certainly, we are extremely well positioned in the big drivers for AI. If you look at high-performance logic, DRAM compute memory, high-bandwidth memory, packaging, power electronics, all of those areas are the fastest-growing areas of the market, very well positioned there. As Bryce said, in ICAPS, we expect over time that will grow kind of mid to high single digits. The 28-nanometer investment, as Bryce said, is increasing significantly as a % of the total in China, and our share there is higher.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nThat'll help us in 2025 and also going forward. The other thing I'd say about ICAPS, this has been a focus for us for more than five years. We have new products in ICAPS that will enable us to expand into large new segments. We have new products where we have significant cost innovations to better compete in cost-sensitive areas of the market. I'm optimistic that with all of those different factors, we're going to continue to see strong growth. We've grown five years previous to this year. We're growing in the first three quarters of 2025, and I think really well positioned for these key inflections.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Analyst)\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Brice, wanted to focus on gross margins. I think a quarter ago, you talked about 48.2% as kind of the floor reflecting China normalizing, but that with kind of trade tensions or whatnot, it might now be 48%. I was hoping you could kind of update on that. Then longer term into 2026 and beyond, can you kind of speak to how you see value-based pricing, cost reductions, and balancing manufacturing across both Austin and Singapore, and where the trajectory for margins could go? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThanks, CJ. Good to hear from you. Yeah, 48.2%. Obviously, we had 49.2% in the quarter. We talked about a very, in the Q2, we talked about a very favorable mix. Our guide is 48.3%. You're right. We highlighted investors might remember last year we were in the 47s, mid-47s, and we were hoping that we could get it into the 48s. We've made good progress on pricing, cost management, and logistics improvements. I do feel like the low 48s, probably right around 48.2%, 48.3%, is the right level where the company's operating at this point. That has modest impact from tariffs. In Q2, very small impact from tariffs because we had inventory positions that were pre-tariffed.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nIn Q3, in our guidance, also modest effect of tariffs because you pointed out we have a very flexible manufacturing operation with a global footprint. We have a global supply chain. We've worked for years since COVID on duplicating sources across the globe, and we'll be making price adjustments for the things that cannot be managed from a tariff perspective. Our guidance for Q3 really reflects being able to manage that environment very well and having the flexibility to manage it very well. The last thing to say on the pricing, we do feel like we're making very good progress with value-based pricing and cost management. I would just say that our expectation is we'll continue to make improvements to that level of margin as we go forward.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nHi, CJ. This is Gary. One thing I would say, aligned with what Bryce talked about, we've been driving these cost improvements. We've made a lot of progress there. We're also driving better value capture as we go forward. We're enabling many of these really critical inflections for the industry. I think the thing that I would focus on here is sustainable margin improvement. We made progress this year. We've been making progress over the last few years, but I really believe that the initiatives that we're driving in cost improvements, the initiatives we're driving in value capture, all of those things will sustain going forward, and we'll continue to see progress this year and in future years.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Weathers from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (Analyst)\nHi there. Thank you for taking my question. On the DRAM side of things, it seems like HBM has really helped put a floor in DRAM WFV spending since cyclically we're still kind of bouncing along the bottom. HBM does still seem to be driving nice growth. Can you help us understand the puts and takes on how to balance those two dynamics going forward? How do we think about the cyclical piece of DRAM compared to the HBM upside that you're seeing?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nOkay, Melissa. Hi. Yeah. Thinking about the HBM component, so from a wafer starts perspective, I think in this year, HBM as a component of DRAM should reach 16%. What we would highlight there is it's growing at a 40% rate, similar to the AI data center type components on the data center side. That has put DRAM in total, including HBM equipment, really continuing to operate at very high levels. At least on our side, I wouldn't say cyclical low. I'd actually say maybe last year was a record year. This year will be close to a record year or could be a record. DRAM's very strong. The way we think of it is it's being pulled by that AI leading edge and all the compute memory that's needed for that. The HBM is a great example of that.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHopefully that gives you a perspective. From our side, that business is operating very strongly across all those end technologies.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Melissa, this is Gary. I would add that if you look over a little over a decade, we've gained 10 points of market share in DRAM. The compute memory is going to be one of the fastest-growing areas of the market over time. If you look at, especially in the AI data center, that business is growing very quickly. We talked about with DDR5 and HBM, 40% growth with our top three leading customers. That business is growing at a high rate. We are very strongly positioned. If you look at what we've been able to achieve in terms of share gains in DRAM and where the DRAM architectures are going for the future, the next big inflection is 4F². That architecture is a great opportunity for Applied. We're deeply engaged with all of those different customers.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nWe will outperform with all of our innovations as that new architecture is adopted. Again, very strong growth in DRAM for Applied outperformance in the past and very well positioned going forward.\n\n**Melissa Weathers** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Last couple of earnings calls, you guys have been articulating a leading edge foundry logic and leading edge memory spending acceleration as we move through the year, which implies that calendar second-half spending on leading edge technologies will be higher versus the first-half spend. Is that still the team's view? Then kind of tied to that, right, advanced technology drives more penetration of your integrated system solutions. I think you guys exited last year with integrated solutions representing about 30% of your overall systems business. Where do you anticipate that mix exiting this fiscal year?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nGreat. Harlan, good to hear from you. On the leading edge, definitely accelerating. What we were highlighting in previous quarters as we sort of were thoughtful about the slower investment rate in ICAPS and the mature technologies after two years of very rapid growth, we were all hoping that leading edge would begin to accelerate after a lesser year in 2024 and 2023. That is exactly what we are seeing. You see a pickup through the course of the year. That should be matched hopefully by all the things that you see in the market. If you look at the cloud service providers, CapEx, those numbers have only been going up. We have seen recent announcements of new factories and spending from the leading logic companies.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, I think we expect that trend to be enduring when we think about all the technologies that are packed around AI data center. DRAM, HBM, advanced packaging, and of course, leading logic where there's 100% utilization on the front end there. That is accelerating. Then on the integrated equipment, we're still averaging approximately 30%. You could look at that as growing at the 7% rate, almost 7% rate that we see the business growing at this point in time.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Analyst)\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question, please.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nThanks. I had a clarification and a question. Bryce, I just wanted to clarify what the message is for services for the entire year this year. I think you were talking about low double-digit growth, but I would assume that the back half is up like 30%, half on half. Is that really the message where you keep talking about the core part of service? That's what's going to grow, low double digits. Can you just tell us what you think the total business will grow for this year? My question is, most of the other companies expect WFV to be pretty first-half weighted this year. I know you do not talk about the market as a whole, but can you give us some sense of whether you would also say that market's first-half weighted this year? Thanks.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nOkay, Tim, thanks. On the services, yes, when we think about core, we're stripping out the 200-millimeter equipment sales for that. If you had an estimate in prior years of what those components were, for our core, we're hitting a record in this quarter. We'll have a record next quarter. We're saying for the whole year, even despite losing, not being able to serve some of those accounts in China, we will have low double-digit growth in the core business. Without that 200-millimeter, the 200-millimeter will make the overall AGS business growth look much smaller for the year. We'll have to see where that lands, but it'll be much smaller for the year. For first-half, second-half, we're talking about three quarters for Applied that are growing almost 7%.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWhat we would say is the trends that are pulling the business seem fairly durable to us. We have talked about leading edge accelerating. Without filling in two more quarters, we will have to see where that goes. We have not seen really a change in the trajectory of demand or the trajectory of those trends in the last 90 days.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nOkay. So you have to say that the back half will be pretty flat with the first half. Is that the message?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nIt's not really the message. Like I said, we won't fill in those last two quarters. Probably when you're thinking of calendar year, that would be Q4 and part of Q1. We are not giving specific guidance for that. What we would say is almost 7% year over year so far, year to date for the company. The trends that are pulling on the market seem fairly durable. Hopefully that helps.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Analyst)\nOkay, Brice. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Analyst)\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. I also had a question of clarification. Gary, just have a longer-term question for you. You're clearly gaining traction in new technologies like gate-all-around, backside power delivery. When I look at your leadership products more on a unit process specification level, it feels like PVD is moving to AMD. On CVD, etch, and CMP, you always had U.S.-Japanese competition, but now you have some legit Chinese competition too in those segments. I'm just kind of wondering how to think about your leadership product momentum over the next one to three years amid these shifts in competition. Also, can you give any color or rationale on the 9% Besi stake? Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nSure, Krish. Yeah, thanks. The way I would think about it, if you look at our leadership products, they're really targeted at the biggest inflections that are being driven by AI. In high-performance logic, what we've said is that we will, for gate-all-around and backside power distribution, those are the two big inflections that are going forward. We'll gain share, and we are extremely well positioned to capture more than 50% of the available opportunity in those inflections. Again, very strongly positioned there. In compute memory and DRAM, that's another one that's being driven by AI. I mentioned that earlier. We gained, in a little over a decade, about 10 points of share in DRAM. We're, again, very well positioned in DRAM on the last 6F² nodes. Also for 4F², we're even better positioned.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nI've met in the last month, I think, pretty much all of those DRAM CEOs and most of the high-performance logic CEOs, very strong positions, very deep engagements. If you look at high-bandwidth memory, we have high share there. Advanced packaging is another one where there are tremendous architecture inflections. We're just very, very well positioned. Krish, again, I have high confidence that we will gain share as those inflections happen. We have visibility because we have such deep relationships with all of these different customers. One of the things that everybody's focused on is this theme of high-velocity co-innovation. Everybody's racing to be first to market with those new architecture inflections. Whoever gets there first wins big. Everybody else is left behind. I think what that's driving is earlier and deeper collaborations with those customers.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nWe have very high visibility on our positions going forward for all of those major architecture inflections.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, I got it. And Krish, on Besi, so five-year relationship with Besi. We recently extended our collaboration agreement, working very well with them. I think you know our perspective on energy-efficient compute is their solution combined with our solutions for Dynowave for bonding will be very important for that energy roadmap going forward. We felt, as we extended the collaboration agreement, we wanted to make an investment in their company at the same time. And on the 9%, no specific information to share there. We had a lot of investments during the quarter in addition to that with our EPIC facility that we're building, the world-class fab in Sunnyvale, and also the share buybacks that we mentioned. That is the information that we have to share there.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nYeah. Krish, what I would say also, I've personally been involved working with Besi for many years. They are the leader in Dynowave for die-to-die bonding. Our teams have developed an integrated hybrid bonding product with six technologies integrated together. There was a question about integrated products earlier on the call. In this case, this is a really important innovation for the most advanced in AI memory chips where, again, we have an Applied platform with the Besi bonder along with five other technologies. We think this is going to be a meaningful growth driver going forward and contribute to a very strong growth rate in our advanced packaging business going into the future.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Analyst)\nThanks, Gary. Thanks, Bryce.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International Group. Your question, please.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking my question. This is for the team. What are the key assumptions embedded in the low and high end of your July quarter revenue guide of $6.7 billion-$7.7 billion?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThanks, Mehdi. That's an astute observation. We widened our range by $100 million at this point. So it's plus or minus $500 million for the quarter. We had been doing plus or minus $400 million. It was really two things. We hadn't changed that in the last few years. The business is obviously larger. We typically ask ourselves whether we should increase the range. Certainly during this period, as we saw during the quarter, there was a lot of volatility in the macro, in the market, in geopolitical, in trade, etc. We felt there's a number of scenarios that are being thought about. We thought it was a good time to widen the range. There's nothing algorithmic or mathematical in this selection. We just thought we would indicate that there's more volatility in the environment than typical.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Analyst)\nI assume that's more impacting the ICAPS business than the leading edge, which is more strategic, right?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nCan you say again, please?\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nMehdi, I think.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nYeah, Mehdi, I think it really is the revenue size is larger. There are changes that are happening from a regulatory standpoint, tariffs, those things that create more uncertainty. It is really a combination of those two things. It was a very small change in range. Again, it is just those factors.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Analyst)\nGot it. Thank you, guys.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. One moment for our next question. As a reminder, if you have a question, please press star 11 on your telephone. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Analyst)\nThank you. My question is on the NAND business. I know it's a relatively small business for you, but it's up nicely, and I think you're guiding for growth again. On one hand, your customers are talking about taking utilization down. On the other hand, you and your peers are talking about spending improving. If you could talk to the sustainability of the NAND growth and what exactly is driving it, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nSure, Srini. This is Brice. Thanks for the question. On the NAND business, it has ticked up both in our Q2 and in our Q3, obviously coming from lower levels. Yeah, I think for that business, agree that utilization is lower, but most of those investments are made to upgrade process technologies and upgrade factories to the latest nodes. We see low 20s % bit demand from a growth rate perspective going forward. The way that the customers have been supplying that is by improving their technologies and advancing those nodes. Most of the business is upgrades, and I would say they do not really change their plans on upgrades with a change in utilization. They will focus on having the density advancement they need from a tech perspective.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI think it's just that these are investments they make with a lead time, and they're thinking about upgrading the technology.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Schultz-Mielander from Redburn Atlantic. Your question, please.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Analyst)\nYeah. Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I had a question on advanced packaging, and I guess it's a question for Gary here, which is around kind of Applied Materials' appetite for risk. It's an emerging application. It's obviously growing very fast, but also maybe the technologies that are going to be needed on a two-, three-, four-year view in advanced packaging may evolve, may change. I just maybe wanted to ask kind of what is Applied's appetite for risk for maybe trying new things, new technologies to serve that market. Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nHi, Timm. In advanced packaging, this is going to be one of the most important inflections of the industry. How you connect together all of the different high-performance logic, the compute memory, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, all of those different chiplets and different components, there is going to be tremendous innovation in advanced packaging. At Applied, we've been investing, and we're the leader in that market. We've been investing for a number of years with new capabilities. We have an advanced packaging lab in Singapore, a full-flow lab where some of our leading customers are working with us there on these new architectures. I think a good thing for us is that we have very high visibility in where the industry is going. I talked about this concept of high-velocity co-innovation.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nWe are working with our customers to shape the industry roadmaps, I think more than anyone else. When we're placing those bets, you talked about appetite for risk, we have pretty high visibility where to place the bets because we're in such deep and connected relationships with the customers, and we have this broad, unique, and connected portfolio. We're in deep relationships with our customers and even our customers' customers as they're looking at inflections in packaging, AI connectivity, those areas. I have very high confidence there are innovations that we're driving that will expand our total available market in packaging. We're extremely well positioned. We've grown significantly over the last few years in packaging, 4X revenue in the last five years. I have high confidence that we'll continue a very high growth rate going forward.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Analyst)\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Your question, please.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Analyst)\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question more on China. I think maybe two months ago, I'm centering on China, there's a new company called PsyCarrier. They launched 30 new tools, I believe, lots of overlap with AMAT portfolio. I think the common perception, based on what I'm hearing, is Applied probably has likely the greater downside than a lot of the peers with all these new companies emerging in China. I want to ask if any thoughts you can provide on that particular competitor and what could be the implications for Applied market share, especially I think the team just talked about actually gaining more share in China as the customers more transitioning from 55, 40 nanometer to 28 nanometer. Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nHi, Charles. Thanks for the question. Again, just to remind you, China Semi is in the mid-20s, including equipment and services as a percentage of total company revenue. Yeah, as we talked about earlier, 28 nanometer where the investment is increasing, we have higher share. I think the most important thing for us is we have a great innovation pipeline in ICAPS. We formed this group more than six years ago. It was actually April 12, 2019, is when we formed the group. We're driving significant innovations with new products that will expand our markets, new TAM for Applied Materials, new products that have significant cost innovations for cost-competitive areas of the market. I feel really good about the pipeline that we have going forward, expanding our available market and our ability to compete.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President and CEO)\nI think in any of these different industries, the key thing is you have to run faster than competitors. We have a great team in ICAPS. They've delivered great results. I would say that I'm pretty positive about the pipeline that we have going forward and our position to drive growth in the ICAPS market into the future.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Analyst)\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Gary and Bryce, you clearly remain confident on your positioning for the upcoming key technology inflections in advanced logic. I think generally there's some anticipation that 2 nanometer and 16 angstrom nodes can represent at least a few hundred thousand of wafer capacity expansion. I don't imagine your thoughts around significance has changed. However, given the current level of geoeconomic concerns, what's your view on pacing here and whether this could cause these investments perhaps to spread out over a longer horizon?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nI guess I'll start, Brian, and thanks for the question. The way we always think of the market is what's driving demand from a wafer perspective. You look at PCs and smartphones, they've been growing at low single digits. Those are fairly stable markets. When you look at data center, it's growing at 20%. If you carve out the wafers inside that that are associated with accelerators, graphics, etc., so the AI component of data center, it's growing at 40%. When we look at the leading edge factories across the industry, they're at 100% utilization. We all have thought about the gate-all-around technology, especially with backside power delivery, and thought, \"Wow, that's a significant improvement in power, performance, and density for the chip.\" It looks like a really good node. That technology looks like a strong node.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nWe think the trends from a demand perspective are very strong. We are expecting a significant buildout of that technology. I think if you look at recent announcements, either cloud service provider CapEx or even the largest foundry, I think you will see a lot of energy around the roadmap.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Analyst)\nYes, thank you. Good evening. I guess the question, and we've gone through a lot with your how are you kind of shaping up this year and know that it's too early to start talking quantitatively on next year. I wonder if you could kind of address a little bit about qualitatively next year, kind of where you're feeling better about growth for next year. What are the things that we should be looking for as we build out our WFE models into next year? What's your level of conviction that next year is indeed a growth year?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nHi, Chris. Great question. The way we think about it is we kind of set that anchor $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion in 2030 for the semi industry. You can use a range of assumptions for what the equipment intensity might be associated with that. That will give you pretty significant growth in the equipment business over the next five years. Probably just like you when you model, we do not try to pick the uneven growth that one year might describe. We model pretty smooth growth from here to 2030, riding AI, riding the AI data center, all the key technologies that we are describing when we think about robotics and large language models and all those types of things. We think those are strong demand drivers. What we would say is those are enduring trends.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYou can see the industry making the investments right now. You look at the cloud service providers, you look at the foundries, you look at us with the investment we're making in our lab here in Sunnyvale and our platform for innovation across the world. I think those are the signals that you should look for: are the companies making those investments and do we expect that trend to continue? I know people always want to know if after five years of growth for Applied and we're growing at 7% so far this year, year to date, everybody wants to know if the next quarter after this one will be down or if next year will be down. We really do not model it that way. We just have kind of a smooth growth to that 2030, and we understand it will be uneven.\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nWe have time for one last question. Thanks.\n\n**Operator**\nCertainly. Our final question for today is a follow-up from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please. Stacy, your line is open. You might have your phone on mute.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nOh, I apologize. Thank you for fitting me in again. I appreciate it. Bryce, I wanted to go back to your commentary just very quickly to make sure I have it on the segment growth for next quarter. I think you said that I thought these were year-over-year statements. Foundry and logic, you'd have leading edge more than offsetting the ICAPS clients. It sounds like you think foundry logic grows year over year. You said DRAM stable, so DRAM kind of flattish year over year. Then you said NAND growing, I guess, year over year, but within the full guide, would that not imply that NAND is down sequentially? Can you sort of confirm that I have that commentary on the segments correct?\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, Stacy, I think you've got all those right. It was a year-over-year commentary that we were providing. NAND has ticked up. Leading logic is definitely accelerating. I think we've shared that mature logic is down, but we expected that after the two years of rapid growth. To the extent that that's a little lower, it's being filled in by leading and just sort of continued strength on the DRAM. What's happened in the DRAM business, depending on which quarter you're looking at, the first couple of quarters last year, we had the shipments to China customers. This year, that business is still very strong, and it's all that leading edge, those leading edge customers that are making those investments. I think you have those puts and takes, correct.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nGot it. Okay. So I'd have basically I'd have DRAM down, I guess DRAM down sequentially, NAND could be up sequentially, and then foundry logic would be up pretty decent sequentially if I tie out those year-over-year statements.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nYeah, that's fair.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nGot it. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. This does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Brice Hill for any further remarks.\n\n**Brice Hill** (CFO)\nThank you. In summary, we're pleased to be operating at record levels. We're well equipped to navigate the dynamic conditions in the economic environment, and we're investing in significant industry collaborations to accelerate innovation, all of which position us to grow our business over the coming years. Thank you. Liz, please close the call.\n\n**Liz Morali** (VP of Investor Relations)\nGreat. Thank you, Bryce, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I would like to call your attention to two upcoming investor events. First, Gary will attend the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on May 29. Then on June 4, Bryce will be at the B of A Global Technology Conference. Lastly, a replay of today's call will be available on the investor relations website by 5:00 P.M. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

During the prepared remarks, all participants will be in a listen only mode. Afterwards, there will be a question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Liz Morale, Vice President of Investor Relations. Liz, you may begin.\n\n**Liz Morali** (Vice President of Investor Relations)\nThank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for today's call. With me today are Gary Dickerson, President and CEO and Bryce Hill, CFO. Before we continue, let me remind you that today's discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including predictions, estimates, projections or other statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties.\n\n**Liz Morali** (Vice President of Investor Relations)\nInformation concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10 ks and eight ks filings with the SEC. We do not intend to update any forward looking statements. During today's call, we will also reference non GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. I will now turn the call over to Gary.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nThanks, Liz. In our first fiscal quarter of twenty twenty five, Applied Materials delivered record revenue surpassing the prior high we set last quarter. The major technology trends reshaping the global economy are made possible by advanced semiconductors underpinning long term secular growth for the industry and especially Applied Materials. We are providing our customers a unique and connected portfolio of solutions to accelerate the technology roadmap, positioning us for continued growth and outperformance in the years to come. In my prepared remarks, I'll share our latest market insights, I'll describe how our innovations are enabling the major device architecture inflections that are critical to advancing energy efficient AI and I'll talk about why high velocity co innovation is more important than ever as the industry races to bring next generation technology to consumers faster and at lower costs.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nStarting with the market, AI remains central to our outlook. With almost infinite possible uses, AI is the most transformative technology change of our lifetimes and a major catalyst for innovation and growth across the technology sector. Early deployment of AI supported approximately 20% year on year growth of global semiconductor sales in 2024 and the market remains on track to exceed $1,000,000,000,000 of annual revenues by 02/1930. We are only at the beginning of what's possible and as we look ahead, we expect disruptive innovations to significantly improve the energy efficiency and cost of AI, opening up new applications and growing the overall market opportunity. To unlock this potential, innovation is required across the technology stack from the models and software as we've seen in recent weeks with DeepSeq to data center architecture, chip design and how those chips are made.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nAdvancements in foundational semiconductor technologies will have a dramatic impact on system level energy and cost reduction in the AI data center. I've previously described four critical areas the industry is currently focusing on: leading edge logic, high performance DRAM, DRAM stacking referred to as high bandwidth memory or HBM and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together in an integrated package. There's also a fifth theme emerging as we are seeing major innovations in power electronics. These innovations can address data transfer energy consumption within the data center as well as significantly reduce grid to data center power losses. Applied has strong leadership in all these areas and we're best positioned at future device architecture inflections, including next generation gate all around transistors, backside power delivery, 4F2 and three d DRAM, advanced packaging, compound semiconductors for power electronics and silicon photonics.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nThese device architecture inflections in logic, compute memory, packaging and power devices grow the market for wafer fab equipment, increase the relative mix of materials engineering technologies and provide opportunities for applied to gain market share. Taking leading edge foundry logic as an example, the transition from the most advanced generation of FinFET to the first nodes with integrated gate all around and backside power delivery grows our total available market by more than 15% to around $14,000,000,000 for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. At the same time, we expect related applied revenues to grow in the 30% range for the equivalent wafer fab capacity. While the bulk of spending for these inflections is ahead of us, we are already seeing a positive impact on our business. In 2024, we believe we outperformed the market in aggregate across leading edge foundry logic, DRAM, advanced packaging and the ICAPS markets outside of China.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nThe ability of U. S. Companies to serve the China market is constrained and has been further limited by updated trade rules announced in December and January. We estimate the incremental impact of these new rules will be around $400,000,000 of revenue in fiscal twenty twenty five, approximately half of which is service revenue. We also see China being a smaller portion of global wafer fab equipment spending in 2025.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nAt Applied Materials, our strategy is to develop and commercialize the most enabling technologies for the industry across leading edge logic, memory, advanced packaging and iCast. We have focused our investments on these high growth inflections that allow us to create and capture more value. One of the ways we are implementing our strategy is to provide our customers unique and connected solutions that take advantage of our broad portfolio of technologies, capabilities and partnerships. Our co optimized and integrated solutions address higher value device challenges for customers and are difficult for competitors to replicate. A good example is our integrated hybrid bonding interconnect solution that combines six technologies, including one module from a partner into a single integrated system.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nIn the past quarter, we successfully completed important qualification milestones and received volume orders from multiple leading edge customers. Our integrated hybrid bonding system is one of our next generation solutions that is allowing us to extend our leadership in advanced packaging. In 2024, our packaging business captured more than half of the market we serve and we remain on track to double our revenues over the next several years. Another key pillar of our strategy is high velocity co innovation. We believe this is key for Applied and our customers to bring next generation technology to market faster and at lower cost.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nBy speeding up cycles of learning through tighter ecosystem collaborations, we are accelerating new chip architectures, driving higher mutual success rates and optimizing R and D efficiencies. Among our accomplishments in the past quarter, we launched our EPIC advanced packaging strategy at a technical summit we hosted in Singapore that brought together R and D leaders representing more than 20 global companies. We were part of two teams that received CHIPS Act grants to develop advanced packaging substrates for three d integration. We are leading the team for silicon substrates and we have a long term partnership and investment in the company that won the grant for glass core packaging. We made significant progress with the construction of the Epic Center in Silicon Valley, which is on track to come online in 2026 and will become the centerpiece of our global epic collaboration platform.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nAnd we partnered with TPG to transition Applied Thin Film Battery business into an independent company. We're also evolving our collaborative model and services where we are helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as they ramp next generation technology into high volume manufacturing. We are deploying our advanced service products including our Actionable Insight Accelerator Data Platform or AIX to help accelerate customers' R and D programs, reduce technology transfer times and optimize device performance yield output and cost in their fabs. Through these closer working relationships, a high percentage of our service revenues is generated from subscriptions in the form of multi year agreements. While our near term service growth is negatively impacted by trade restrictions, we remain confident that we will still grow AGS at a low double digit annualized growth rate over the longer term.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nBefore I hand over to Bryce, I'll quickly summarize. As major technology trends reshape the global economy in the semiconductor industry, Applied continues to deliver strong financial performance in the near term. We are best positioned at major device architecture inflections in fast growing areas of the market that are critical to energy efficient AI and we are focused on high velocity co innovation with our customers and partners to bring breakthrough technology to market faster than ever before. Bryce?\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThanks, Gary, and thank you to everyone joining us for today's call. We had a strong start to the fiscal year with healthy revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, which helped drive a 12% year over year increase in non GAAP earnings per share. In addition, we distributed $1,600,000,000 to shareholders with $1,300,000,000 of share repurchases and $326,000,000 of dividends. For fiscal Q1, our results were largely in line with our expectations with total net sales of approximately $7,200,000,000 up 7% year over year with growth in both semiconductor systems and applied global services. Non GAAP gross margin was 48.9% up 100 basis points year over year and our highest quarterly gross margin since fiscal year two thousand.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThe strong margin performance in Q1 was the result of a very favorable mix and increasing adoption of our leading edge technologies and advanced integrated systems. In addition, we progressed on our value based pricing initiatives and cost reductions. Non GAAP operating expenses were $1,310,000,000 with increased R and D investments to support our technology growth areas. Non GAAP EPS was a record $2.38 up 12% year over year given the revenue growth, better profitability and share repurchases. Moving to the segments.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSemiconductor systems sales were $5,360,000,000 for Q1, up 9% year over year driven by 20% growth in foundry logic, partially offset by an expected decline in DRAM sales as prior year sales to customers in China did not repeat. Non GAAP operating margin of 37.3% was up 160 basis points year over year. Sales for the ICAPS nodes, which serve customers across the IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor markets were down slightly year over year and flat quarter over quarter. Moving to Applied Global Services. AGS delivered revenue of $1,590,000,000 in Q1, up 8% year over year with healthy growth in services partially offset by a decline in sales of 200 millimeter equipment.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nNon GAAP operating margin of 28% was down 30 basis points year over year. Lastly, our display business delivered revenue of $183,000,000 Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6,300,000,000 and debt of $6,300,000,000 Cash from operations in the quarter was $925,000,000 capital expenditures were $381,000,000 and free cash flow was $544,000,000 dollars We distributed $1,600,000,000 to shareholders in the quarter, including $1,300,000,000 in share repurchases and $326,000,000 in dividends. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $7,600,000,000 remains available under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our outlook, we are seeing strong momentum for leading edge foundry logic, where we are particularly well positioned as our customers ramp the most advanced technology nodes with gate all around transistors into high volume manufacturing. Offsetting leading edge is a more measured level of investment in the ICAPS nodes, following strong spending in 'twenty three and 'twenty four.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nIn DRAM, we are seeing healthy demand, but face tough year over year compares given the purchases from Chinese customers in 2024 that do not repeat this year. We are also seeing growth in NAND, albeit from historically low levels. As Gary mentioned, as a result of the expanded export controls announced in December and January, we expect to face a headwind to revenue of approximately $400,000,000 in fiscal twenty twenty five. Nearly half of that impact will be in Q2. The impacts in the second half of the fiscal year will be more weighted to AGS as we are no longer able to service certain customers.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd following the step down in revenue in Q2, we would anticipate a return to growth in Q3 for AGS. Based on these trade restrictions and our view of our business, for Q2, we expect that China as a percentage of total revenue will be about five percentage points lower than in Q1. This is below the normalized level of approximately 30%. Taking all of these factors into account for fiscal Q2, we expect total revenue of $7,100,000,000 plus or minus $400,000,000 which represents a 7% increase year over year and non GAAP EPS of $2.3 plus or minus $0.18 which represents a 10% increase year over year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue approximately $5,300,000,000 up 8% year over year AGS revenue of approximately $1,550,000,000 up 1% year over year and display revenue of approximately $250,000,000 We expect non GAAP gross margin of approximately 48.4% and non GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1,300,000,000 We are modeling a tax rate of approximately 13%.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nIn closing, our business is strong and we remain confident in our growth opportunities across all of our business segments. We are making significant investments in R and D to grow our share at the leading edge, and we are increasing our capital investments to be the leader in high velocity co innovation with our customers. This is an important indicator of the confidence we have in the growth trajectory of our business. And with our differentiated technology, unique insights and deep industry relationships, we are poised to benefit from the technology transitions and semiconductor growth that is expected over the coming years. Liz, we're now ready to begin the Q and A.\n\n**Liz Morali** (Vice President of Investor Relations)\nThanks, Bryce.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Managing Director)\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I know you guys aren't or haven't been giving specific WFE numbers, but at a high level, Gary and or Bryce, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of context on how you're thinking about the year. I know you gave a couple of comments, but by application, by geography, how is 2025 likely to shape up in your view? And more importantly, your outperformance vis a vis the market, what are some of the key drivers that we should be focused on?\n\n**Toshiya Hari** (Managing Director)\nAnd if you can speak to the magnitude of outperformance relative to what you achieved in 2024, that would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOkay. Thanks, Toshiya. Nice to hear from you. So first, we'd say that our Q2 guide gives a really good indication of how we think the market is evolving. So leading edge with all the strength that you see in AI and pulling DRAM, advanced logic and HBM that factors into what we see in the market today.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo leading edge is growing. We've been thinking it will be accelerating through the course of the year and we do see that growing strongly in Q2. And we highlighted that we've also been watching the ICAPS market after the significant build out the last couple of years in China and that is lower in Q2. So those things offset, but you see on total that we still have consistent year over year growth in the overall market. So that's the big change from a market perspective.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nIf you look at the memory side, our memory is roughly flat quarter over quarter. We do see some additions on the NAND side and that's offset by a slight reduction in DRAM. NAND is growing, but of course that's from a smaller level. And the last thing I would share is when you think about advanced packaging, we had a significant amount of capacity adds last year in the HBM side for the initial burst of capacity. And we're still selling into HBM, still adding equipment into that market, but it's at a slower rate.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo that's part of the outlook also. So the key thing there is we've all been waiting to see if Advanced Logic would ramp strongly enough to offset any slower rate of investment in ICAPS. And that is what we're seeing in Q2. And that's our best what we try to do is share what we're seeing today and we think that's our best indication and how you can think about the year at this point.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes, Toshiya, relative to the outperformance question, over the last four years, including last year, we outperformed in aggregate across leading edge foundry logic, DRAM, high bandwidth memory, advanced packaging and ICAPS markets outside of China. And we've been talking about this a lot. We're focused on major device architecture inflections critical to AI energy efficient computing. When we're meeting with all of our customers, that's where they're all focused. So for us, we're on track to capture greater than 50% share of our served market in gate all around and backside power and foundry logic.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nWe gained 10 points of DRAM share and we're positioned to gain share as 4F2 and three d DRAM architectures are adopted. Packaging was around $1,700,000,000 in 2024, up 3x in four years. And as we've said many times, we're positioned to double this business in the coming years. In ICAPS, we gained several points of share since we formed the group six years ago. We brought several new products to market.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nWe have a strong pipeline of new products that will grow our available market and position us well in this segment. And materials engineering intensity where Applied has clear leadership is increasing in next generation chip architectures. So going forward, I like how we're positioned to win these major inflections. Again, we've been outperforming in all of these segments over the last four years and we're well positioned to continue to outperform going forward.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question please.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nHi, thank you for taking my question. Bryce, I appreciate the color on the April. The silicon systems down a little bit, explained by the China impact. And you're talking about the return to growth in AGS. Can you also comment on the silicon systems?\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nDo they return to sequential growth in the July? Or we'll have to wait and see?\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nYes. Thanks, Atif. I think we'll have to wait and see on the semiconductor systems. But what we're sharing is we've been expecting the leading edge to accelerate. When you think about the gate all around and backside power nodes in the market and the advantages of those nodes for leading edge architectures, we expect a significant amount of capacity to be put in place in those nodes.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd that is what you see in Q2. And we expect that that is a good indication of where the market will be going. And then on the offset for that, we highlighted the ICAPS and we've been watching that. But I'll just say that market continues to evolve. Our forecast for ICAPS and for ICAPS China seems to change every single quarter.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so we'll see how that evolves through the rest of the year. And then on the services business, yes, this will be similar to 2022 when there were new trade rules. We'll have a step back as you can see in our guide in Q2, but we expect to grow from there at the low double digit rate as we continue to add customers, add new types of services and the new customers and new locations will make it more likely the services business is utilized by the customers.\n\n**Atif Malik** (Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. You said that the China impact in the second half will be weighted to AGS, but you also said AGS returns to growth in Q3. So like how do I square that circle? What's offsetting the China impact in the second half?\n\n**Stacy Rasgon** (Analyst)\nAnd just like broadly, if I were to add the $200,000,000 ish or so that AGS is getting hit by the China sanctions, if you added that $200,000,000 back in, would it still grow double digits this year?\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nYes, that's a good question. Thank you, Stacy, for the question. So on the AGS side, the way to think about it is approximately half of the impact will be taken in Q2 and then it will be a continued impact in the following quarters. But we don't expect it to be a sequential reconciling line item. In other words, whatever business we can't support in Q2, that's the same business or less in Q3 and Q4.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo there is an impact in Q3 and Q4, but we think you shouldn't worry about it from a modeling perspective. We'll just begin to add from there and we'll grow at the rate that we've described low double digits as we continue to add installed base and tools to support. And then, didn't do the calculation. I guess what I would say is from a core AGS perspective, if you take the 200 millimeter out, we're absolutely growing at low double digits or higher.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.\n\n**CJ Muse** (Senior Managing Director)\nYes. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could speak a bit to gross margins. You talked about value based pricing starting to come in, in the January. I would love to hear more about how you see that flowing through the model throughout all of calendar twenty twenty five. And I guess as part of that, how should we be thinking about kind of evolving mix in terms of modeling gross margin, either first half, second half or kind of exit rate for calendar twenty twenty five would be very helpful? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOkay. Thank you, CJ. Good to hear from you. So on the gross margin, 48.948.4% in our guide in Q2, very strong mix in both quarters. Obviously, with the China impacts for Q2, it's a little bit lesser mix strength.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe're still going to reiterate our 48% underlying rate. So we think with when we don't have those quarters with ultra strong mix, that's still about the ballpark for our normalized rate. So think in the second half that unless we maintain the exact same mix, which we likely don't expect, we will be closer to that 48% gross margin for the year or not for the year, sorry, we're not giving a guide for the year, but that is our underlying baseline rate to think of as you think about where the business is normally. And then if you think about the pricing, I think of two dynamics with pricing. One, the solutions that we're developing that Gary has pointed the company toward the inflections, those are increasingly valuable solutions for the customers.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so there's increasing value proposition for the equipment itself. And then our pricing mechanism is to make sure that we're including that in our thinking with respect to the pricing and we also have a disciplined infrastructure to have those discussions with customers. So as we allocate our R and D, we're of course allocating to the areas that we think are most valuable in the market. And we think it's a matter of execution to achieve that value in the marketplace, which is what we're trying to do. So I said third inning last quarter on those on the process for pricing and I think that's still accurate.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question please.\n\n**Vivek Arya** (Managing Director)\nThanks for taking my question. I actually had a longer term conceptual question for Gary related to LITHO versus HNTAP intensity. Let's say overall WFE intensity stays around mid teens, it means WFE will grow in line with semiconductor industry sales over the next several years. And if that happens, do you think, Gary, Little takes more share or do you think Etch or Debt take more share and hence grow faster or slower than overall semiconductor industry sales? I've heard arguments on both sides, but would appreciate your views.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nHi, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So if I look at the major inflections that we're focused on going forward, If you look at leading edge foundry logic, Gator all around and backside power, our customers have talked about being able to achieve in backside power 30% area scaling benefit beyond power and performance benefits with really no change in feature size. So that's basically what we're seeing in foundry logic and we think that continues going forward. In DRAM, if you look at what our customers have talked about in 4F2, they also talk about significant area savings as they implement that new architecture.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nAnd of course, again for all of these things, we're incredibly well positioned. And then when you get to three d DRAM, three d DRAM is more similar, not the same materials, but a similar impact where the relative spending for materials engineering goes up significantly versus lithography. And then of course another area that we're focused on and the entire industry is focused on is advanced packaging. And when we look at what the AI servers look like three or four years from now, the architectures are going to be very different. And the way the data is connected in those architectures, there's just going to be tremendous innovation again around materials innovation.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nSo when I look across any of these different markets and of course ICAPS is really all driven through materials innovations. We've talked about this before in our master classes. We see the percentage of materials engineering relative spending to be increasing going forward around all of these different architecture inflections.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question please.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot. Bryce, do you think as you look at I know that you're not going to give us a WFE number for last year, but do you think you gained WFE share? That's the first question. And then how do you kind of assess Gary, the headwind from these, from these, you know, from these, you know, from these, you know, from these, you know, from these, you know, companies in China because I know that they have delayed rev rec. So it makes it hard to sort of measure year to year, but they're about 5% now of WFE. It's up like 400 basis points over the past four to five years and that's all debt and etching. You've done a great job holding share and gaining share. But how do you sort of think about that headwind from churn because so much of the incremental spending is from there? Thanks.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOkay, Tim, nice to hear from you. Thank you. On the share in 24%, of course, we don't know yet in terms of the final measures there. But you heard in Gary's script, he talked about, we think we've gained share in all the markets except for likely China. So we'll just have to see what that reading is once all the share numbers are in.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo we feel well positioned from that perspective. And even in China, we feel good about the way we compete. It's just, yes, the local Chinese vendors have some advantages with the trade rules that have been put in place. And then on the headwinds for China, I think we do have lower visibility, but we continue to add customers and we think that's a huge market. It's our largest ICAPS market and ICAPS is the largest market for Applied.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd we expect that to grow over time at the device level mid to high single digits. As you know, the equipment investments in the last couple of years have been ahead of the market, so we've expected it to moderate for some period of time. So we'll see how that plays out, but for us that continues to be one of the most important markets for the company.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes, Tim, just I would add, and again, I talked about this a little bit earlier. Leading edge foundry logic, we're incredibly well positioned for those inflections. DRAM, we've gained 10 points of share, and again, really well positioned for 4F2 and three d DRAM. High bandwidth memory, that's another one where we have a very strong leading position. And advanced packaging is another area where it's up 3x in four years and we anticipate that we'll double that business and then that'll keep going into the future.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nAnd again, we're just really well positioned for all those inflections. In ICAPS, we have room to grow in PDC and etch and we have momentum in those segments. And I talked earlier about the pipeline of ICAPS innovations. Again, we formed this group six years ago. We brought 20 new products to market and we have new products in the pipeline that will expand our total available market.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nWe have new products for cost competitive applications and we have innovations to enable new ICAPS device architectures that we're co innovating with leading customers. So as Bryce said, in the areas where we can compete, I feel really good about our positions and our pipeline going forward.\n\n**Timothy Arcuri** (Managing Director)\nThanks a lot, Katy.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We track many of your end customers in the semiconductor industry, both fabless and IDMs and we tracking their design starts especially at two nanometers design starts appear to be accelerating since the second half of last year, especially in areas like AI, accelerated compute, mobile. Is the team in talking with your customers, is the team getting a sense on how big the upcoming two nanometer node transition and more importantly volume production potential could be relative to three nanometer?\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nHi, Harlan. Gary might also add on to this. I've seen various estimates for two nanometer based on the performance benefits of two nanometer. I think we're expecting that to be a large node. If you look at some of the third party estimates, that should be a good landing spot for designs just like seven nanometer in the past was a good landing spot for designs.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo we're expecting it to be on the large side from a node perspective.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes, Arlan, I would just add that everybody's focused on energy efficient computing for AI. And if you look at what our customers are saying, they're very bullish about the size of that two nanometer node.\n\n**Harlan Sur** (Executive Director - Equity Research)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Zankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Gary, I had a question on gate all around. You've spoken about getting over 50% share of the incremental TAM there, but it seems like the epi stack is one of the more critical ones and your epitaxy competitor seems to be making some strides. So I'm just kind of curious, can you talk a little bit about your epi market share and if you still feel confident in the 50% plus share gain of the overall gate all around opportunity? Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes. We're in as I mentioned earlier, we're in deep partnerships with all of our customers focused around this concept of high velocity co innovation. And we're working with every one of our customers out a decade into the future on multiple technology nodes. For Gate All Around, we have we still are on track to do what we had talked about earlier with gaining more than 50% of the incremental spending for gate all around and epi as part of that. We're in very strong position.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nI think 85% of those epi steps are selective epi where we have tremendous strength. We have new innovations we're bringing to market in epi and so we still feel very confident in our outperformance going forward.\n\n**Krish Sankar** (Managing Director)\nThanks Gary.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nThank you. My question is on China. I think Bryce you said for Q2 outlook, you used the word China will be below normal in terms of percent of exposure. I would think that the export restrictions, those are permanent. So I'm just curious as to when you say below normal, are you expecting China to recover to like the 30% level that you previously communicated?\n\n**Srini Pajjuri** (Managing Director)\nAnd then when do you think we might get to that level? And then maybe for Gary, Gary, over the last ninety days, excluding the export restrictions, can you talk to how the demand conditions are within China? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOkay. Thanks, Srini. So first of all, 30% we still think will be a good long term rate for us or a good long term estimate of the share to China. When you think about the market, of course, for us now that's an ICAPS market. We can't serve the leading edge.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nBut that will be a growing market over time. The devices will grow mid to high single digits, if not more, heading to the one helping to get to the $1,300,000,000,000 or yes, $1,000,000,000,000 to $1,300,000,000,000 semiconductor market by 02/1930. So that market will continue to grow. We may pause a little bit less. We may have a little bit lower rate of investment as we go through the next short period of time, will that adjust?\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nBut that's a very strong market for us. So 26% in Q2 and 30% is a good estimate for the company. And of course, that includes all of our businesses, AGS and Display also. And then Gary, on what we're seeing with respect to demand? Yes, I think I'll just make a comment on that.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nIt's still our largest market. So you see leading edge accelerating, but ICAPS is still our largest market and China is the largest country inside that market. And so when you're thinking about it and you're thinking about what we're describing as a step back in the rate of investment, you should still think about it as just a very large opportunity and growth opportunity going forward. And so we think the rate slows down a little bit after two huge years of investment, but we expect that market to grow over time. We've continued to add customers.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nWe're tracking a large number of projects that are underway. We expect capacity to be added every single year and that forms the back bone of our expectations.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes. The one thing I would add is that, we believe that the ICAPS market over the longer term will grow kind of mid to high single digits. And as I mentioned earlier, we have new products in the pipeline that expand our total available market, new products for cost competitive segments and opportunities to grow in large segments where we have momentum. So I think longer term, we're positive on the market and positive on our position in the market.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question please.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nHi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions or maybe one question. Maybe for Bryce, I think you previously disclosed a $549,000,000 reduction in backlog for the fiscal year in a filing. And you're quantifying a $400,000,000 impact for the year.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nDid you revise what that actual impact would be? Or is there some maybe the residual amount of $149,000,000 that sits outside of the twelve month horizon?\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nYou've got it exactly right, Brian. So it's not much of a change that $549,000,000 was our backlog and it covered more than just the year. And so we shared, I think, what was in the twelve months. And if you did that math, I think it was about $3.8 So we're still very close in terms of what we're thinking the impact is for the year.\n\n**Brian Chin** (Director)\nThanks.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatricke from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nThanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for DRAM growth. If we were to exclude just the benefit of China DRAM spending in the comparison a year ago, how should we think about the growth in your business this year?\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nYes. Thanks, Joe. I'll start on this one. I think we've seen two record years of DRAM and of course '24 was buoyed by the extra China demand that we saw. And I can't call the year here, but we see the rate of investment in DRAM continuing in the rest of the world.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo there's a lot of pull for the HBM solution and there's a lot of pull for DRAM in the advanced compute performance systems. So I would expect continued momentum in DRAM and that's included in our outlook in Q2.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes, Joe, I would just say that as I mentioned earlier, we're more bullish on compute memory than we are in storage memory. And then what our customers have said is it takes three times the number of wafers to produce the same number of bits for HBM. So that's going to certainly help the growth rate over the longer term.\n\n**Joe Quatrochi** (Director &amp; Equity Research Analyst)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Hsieh from Needham and Company. Your question please.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Managing Director - Senior Analyst)\nHi, good afternoon. I have a question about the revenue expected revenue from Gate all around nodes. You previously said more than RMB 2,500,000,000.0 in Cisco I mean, in probably calendar twenty twenty four and you expect to double. Has the '25 number moved up or down or any changes to that number? And maybe the other part of the question, I think that you previously said last year stayed all around revenue plus this year kind of implies $100,000 global capacity build on two nanometer by the end of this year.\n\n**Charles Shi** (Managing Director - Senior Analyst)\nDo you see potentially that $8 a run spending can accelerate further into '26 Because we were trying to think about what the end capacity it could be in 2026, but do you want to get your early thoughts on 2026 if possible? Thank you.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOkay, Charles. Thanks for the question. So first thing, yes, we have not changed our expectations for growth looking into 'twenty five with the gate all around related equipment. So 2.5 in in twenty four billion and then the opportunity to double that in twenty five billion. And if you put those together, that's just over 7,000,000,000.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd when we describe the SAM for us with gate all around and backside power, yes, you can back in and say that implies that there's approximately 100,000 wafer starts of pilot and HBM or HVM, excuse me, high volume manufacturing capacity being put in place in the beginning. And then, of course, you'll have to do your own research to see what size you think the node would be. I would just suggest that nodes are generally larger than that. So we would expect that to continue and the ramp to continue beyond 25 for sure.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes. I would say the one thing incrementally is that as you go forward, you're going to add in backside power. That also is growing our available market and we have a very strong share there. So once you have gate all around and backside power together, our opportunity grows significantly.\n\n**Operator**\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nYes, thank you. Good evening. I guess the question is regarding sort of where your level of confidence is in your customer forecast right now. And I know you haven't given us guidance for the full year, obviously, but I know the customers have generally give you pretty good visibility on the forecast. Maybe you could talk about the different segments and you sound pretty constructive with regard to foundrylogic spending for the year.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nYour comments suggested that ICAP the forecast have been changing a lot. So I'd imagine that there's some uncertainty there. Perhaps you could speak in those terms for the different segments.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSure. Thanks for the question, Chris. So I think I would put the level of confidence for larger customers as fairly high. So especially since COVID and the inflation events that we saw, we've asked for longer perspectives from all of our customers. So we have more visibility with the larger customers.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nSo if you think about leading logic, more visibility certainly for DRAM, certainly for NAND. And then I would split up ICAPS. It would be the same sort of observation for the more mature, longer standing companies in the ICAPS space, good visibility, same practices. And then for the long tail in ICAPS, including a lot of the customers in China, there's just much less experience there on both sides. And so the visibility gets lower and that's where we've seen a lot of volatility in our forecast.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nI think in the past couple of years, we've continually increased our China forecast as we've gone through the year. And so you just have less visibility and the plans change as that goes forward. And then just a last comment, thinking about foundry logic because there's lots of questions about the various foundries. Our perspective there is not only do we have the information from the customers, but we try to also triangulate with our end market expectations. And so we think we're pretty comfortable with our forecast for leading logic being driven by data center PC, smartphone and understanding what the end demand is for those markets.\n\n**Chris Caso** (Managing Director)\nThank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question please.\n\n**Vijay Rakesh** (Managing Director)\nYes. Just a question on the packaging side. I know packaging is becoming more and more important and on the memory side. I'm just wondering if there's a way to look at what the mix of just packaging was of total WFE, if we were to look at 2025 and how you see that, that mix of WFE growing as packaging becomes a bigger and bigger chunk of both memory and logic? Thanks.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nI'll try Vijay. We said last year that in 2024 that our packaging related revenues in advanced packaging were $1,700,000,000 And so you know that we have an advantage share in that space. So you probably have to do some backward math to imply what packaging is. And it's growing at a strong rate. I think just thinking about the what's behind that, we all know that there's Gary calls it a race for performance on these leading edge systems, getting the highest utilization out of GPU, CPUs, accelerators, etcetera.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd that's really what's driving the increased demand for these packaging technologies. So we expect that to grow significantly over the coming years.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nVijay, we also talked about doubling again our packaging revenue over the next few years. And there's just tremendous innovation happening in this space. We talked about CHIPS grants on new substrate technologies for silicon and glass, how you connect the AI server and that architecture in three or four years is going to be very different than what it looks like today. So I believe this is a great opportunity for Applied. We're the leader in wiring on the front of the wafer, back of the wafer and in advanced packaging.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nAnd this segment is going to see a significant compound annual growth rate because it's so important for energy efficient computing.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question please.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nYes. Thanks for taking my question. One question, two parts. Based on the last 10 ks, the SSD backlog of $8,300,000,000 down 23% year over year. And then AGS backlog of $6,800,000,000 up 32%.\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nWhen do you expect backlog for SSD to show the inflection point and show growth? And on the AGS, the $200,000,000 that is going to come out because of the restriction in China, that seems a very small part of the AGS backlog. Is that a reflection of the AGS backlog is in multi year? Or any color you can add here would be great.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nYes, Mehdi, thanks for the question. You've got it right on the AGS. We've got multi year contracts in AGS that tends to make that backlog look larger and your book to bill look much larger when we sign those contracts. So the average contract life I think is in the two point nine year region and we're signing some that are longer than that. So that really is what distorts the backlog or makes it larger for AGS.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd then on the equipment side, since the supply chain and issues related to COVID, we've been normalizing on the equipment side. So we stopped reporting that on a quarterly basis because it's not a very good indication of our the underlying business changes. We're working to get longer visibility with our customers and we're working to get longer commits on the builds. And so there's a lot of movement in that. So I wouldn't have anything to share other than what you've seen in our 10\n\n**Mehdi Hosseini** (Senior Equity Research Analyst)\nks. Got it. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Schultze Vielander from Redburne Blattnick. Your question please.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Partner)\nYes. Hi there. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe one for Gary and one for Bryce, please. Gary, you mentioned advanced packaging and you referenced volume orders from multiple leading edge customers.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Partner)\nMaybe could you share a little bit of color in terms of what kind of device applications they are and when you'd expect volume manufacturing to begin? And then Bryce, just a modeling question on that tax asset revaluation. Could you maybe just provide a little more color on that? And is there any read across or implication for the remaining $2,400,000,000 of deferred tax assets on the balance sheet? Thank you.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nYes. Tim, relative to packaging revenue, it's really coming from all of the different packaging architectures. We have a very strong position, broad, unique, connected portfolio. So I wouldn't say that, again, for us, including an HBM or we were at $700,000,000 in revenue this last year, we have strength across all of those different architecture types. I don't really want to comment, I'll let customers comment on which architectures they're ramping.\n\n**Gary Dickerson** (President, CEO &amp; Executive Director)\nI would say, as I mentioned earlier, there's going to be tremendous innovation in this space with very different architectures than what are in the market today. This is going to be very important for energy efficient computing. Applied has been investing to be positioned to win those architecture inflections.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nOkay. And then Tim, thanks for the tax question. So, yes, good to point out that on our GAAP net income, you'll see a significant difference in the growth in our non GAAP income. And what is happening there, it's one of those situations where good news is bad news. So we've just renewed our incentive rates in Singapore.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nAnd so the tax asset that we have in Singapore that was created years and years ago when we moved assets to Singapore, that is essentially less value less valuable because it will protect from lower taxes, if that makes sense. So our tax rate goes down, which is good news. And then the asset that you have to protect from taxes is a little bit less valuable than what it was with higher tax rates. And so that $674,000,000 I think that number is a revaluation of that tax asset. And I wouldn't look we're amortizing the benefits of that tax move of years to go.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThat's always in our reconciliation. But this particular event that we're talking about, I don't think there's any look forward on that.\n\n**Timm Schulze-Melander** (Partner)\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Bryce for any further remarks.\n\n**Brice Hill** (Senior VP &amp; CFO)\nThank you. To recap, we believe we're well positioned in both the near term and the longer term as the investments we're making in R and D for leading edge technology inflections together with our efforts to accelerate industry collaboration set us up to benefit from the semiconductor growth as expected over the coming years. Thank you for attending today. And Liz, please close the call.\n\n**Liz Morali** (Vice President of Investor Relations)\nThank you, Bryce, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. A replay of today's call will be available on the Investor Relations website by five P. M. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.\n\n**Operator**\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
